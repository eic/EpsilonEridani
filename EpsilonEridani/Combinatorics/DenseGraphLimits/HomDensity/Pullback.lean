# Homomorphism densities are invariant under measure-preserving pullback

If `f : Ω' → Ω` pushes a probability measure `ν` forward to `μ`, then a graphon `W` on `(Ω, μ)` and
its pullback `W.comap f` on `(Ω', ν)` have the *same* homomorphism densities:
`t(F, W.comap f) = t(F, W)` for every finite graph `F`.

Unlike the corresponding statement for the cut norm
(`EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.cutNorm_comap`), no cut-norm estimate or inequality is needed.
The proof is instead a measure-theoretic change-of-variables argument. A homomorphism density is
an integral over vertex assignments `V → Ω`, and postcomposition with
`f` sends assignments upstairs to assignments downstairs; `MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_pi`
says that this coordinatewise map is itself measure preserving for the product measures, and the
integrand transforms along it on the nose, because each edge factor only ever evaluates `W` at
images of the assignment.

This is what makes homomorphism densities a *cross-carrier* observable. Two graphons on different
carriers are compared through a coupling `π`, which reads both as graphons on `(Ω₁ × Ω₂, π)` by
pulling back along the coordinate projections; those projections are measure preserving precisely
because `π` is a coupling, so the pulled-back densities are the original ones. That identification
is the step turning the same-carrier counting lemma into its coupling form,
`EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.counting_lemma_coupling`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.edgeFactor_comap` — an edge factor of a pulled-back graphon is the edge
  factor of the graphon at the postcomposed assignment;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.homDensity_comap` — `t(F, W.comap f) = t(F, W)` for a measure-preserving
  `f`.
