# Homomorphism densities in a finite graph

Two densities of a finite pattern graph `F` in a finite host graph `G`:

* `homDensityFin F G = |Hom(F, G)| / |V(G)| ^ |V(F)|` — all homomorphisms;
* `injHomDensity F G = |Inj(F, G)| / (|V(G)|)_{|V(F)|}` — the *injective* ones, normalized by the
  **falling factorial**.

These are the finite-graph front of the sampling theory. Nothing here is about graphons, and nothing
here samples: these are the estimators the later sampling laws are estimators *of*.

## The falling factorial, not the binomial coefficient

`injHomDensity` divides by `(Fintype.card W).descFactorial (Fintype.card V)`, the number of
*ordered* injections of a `|V(F)|`-element set into `V(G)`. Its numerator counts ordered injective
homomorphisms, so the two agree as conventions. Dividing instead by `Nat.choose` would count
unordered images against ordered maps and bias the sampling estimator by `|V(F)|!` — the later
unbiasedness identity would read `k! · t(F, W)` rather than `t(F, W)`. The convention is fixed here
so that no downstream statement has to carry the correction.

## One counting convention, not two

`card_injective_hom_eq_labelledCopyCount` identifies the count in the numerator of `injHomDensity`
with Mathlib's `SimpleGraph.labelledCopyCount`, and `injHomDensity_eq_labelledCopyCount_div` carries
that to the density itself. This is proved, not assumed, and it is in this file deliberately:
without it, `injHomDensity` would silently establish a second counting convention alongside
Mathlib's. `SimpleGraph.Copy F G` is definitionally an injective homomorphism, so the bridge is an
equivalence of subtypes; note that Mathlib puts the **host** graph first, so the copy count of `F`
inside `G` is `G.labelledCopyCount F`.

This settles the *numerator*. Mathlib has no hom-density primitive, so nothing here pins the
`descFactorial` denominator; that convention is chosen here and is pinned later by the unbiasedness
anchor `integral_injHomDensity_sampleGraph`.

## Counting with `Nat.card`

Both densities count with `Nat.card`, which is total: it returns `0` on an infinite type and needs
no `Fintype` instance or decidability on the hom type, on `G`, or on `G.Adj`. The counted types are
finite here, so no generality is lost — but the definitions can be stated and rewritten without
carrying decidability hypotheses that the analytic statements downstream would then inherit.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.homDensityFin` — the homomorphism density `t(F, G)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.injHomDensity` — the injective homomorphism density `t₀(F, G)`.
Both density bodies stay unexposed; `homDensityFin_def` and `injHomDensity_def` are the unfolding
lemmas downstream modules should use.

## Main results

* `card_injective_hom_eq_labelledCopyCount`, `injHomDensity_eq_labelledCopyCount_div` — the bridge
  to Mathlib's counting primitive, at the level of the count and of the density;
* `card_hom_eq_card_adjPreservingMaps` — homomorphisms are counted by the
  adjacency-preserving vertex maps;
* `homDensityFin_nonneg`, `homDensityFin_le_one`, `injHomDensity_nonneg`, `injHomDensity_le_one` —
  both densities lie in `[0, 1]`, unconditionally. The degenerate cases are included: when the host
  is empty and the pattern is not, numerator and denominator both vanish and `x / 0 = 0` gives `0`.

## References

* Roadmap: `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/DenseGraphLimits/README.md`, Layer 9a — the finite hom-density
  estimators. The signatures and the counting-bridge proof are taken from
  `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/DenseGraphLimits/Suggested.lean` (Layer 9a), generalized here from a
  `SimpleGraph (Fin m)` host to an arbitrary finite host. The hom-versus-injective closeness bound,
  the sampling laws, the unbiasedness anchor, and finite-graph graphons are separate targets and are
  not built here.
* The roadmap lists this bridge under its migration-backed routes, with an independent proof in
  `cameronfreer/graphon` (pin `6eccca5`). No material is adapted from that source; the proof here
  follows `Suggested.lean`.

/-! ### The bridge to Mathlib's counting primitive -/

/-- The count in the numerator of `injHomDensity` is Mathlib's labelled copy count.

`SimpleGraph.Copy F G` is definitionally an injective homomorphism, so this is an equivalence of
subtypes. Mathlib takes the host graph first: `G.labelledCopyCount F` counts copies of `F` inside
`G`.

This settles the numerator against the existing Mathlib primitive, so `injHomDensity` does not
introduce a parallel counting convention.

Deliberately not `@[simp]`: the left-hand side is not in simp normal form, since `Nat.card` of a
`Fintype` rewrites to `Fintype.card`, and the repo's `simpNF` linter rejects the annotation. Stating
it with a `Fintype.card` left-hand side instead would abandon the `Nat.card` counting convention the
roadmap pins for these densities. -/
