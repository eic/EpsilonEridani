# Homomorphism densities of a graphon

The homomorphism density `t(F, W)` of a finite graph `F` in a graphon `W`: integrate, over all maps
`x : V(F) → Ω`, the product of `W` along the edges of `F`.

```text
t(F, W) = ∫ ∏_{e ∈ E(F)} W (x eᵢ) (x eⱼ) dμ^{V(F)}
```

**Edges are `Sym2`, and no orientation is chosen.** An edge of a `SimpleGraph` is a `Sym2` element,
with no distinguished endpoint. Rather than pick a representative, `edgeFactor` is built with
`Sym2.lift` from the symmetric function `fun a b => W (x a) (x b)` — symmetric exactly because a
graphon is. Choosing an orientation would work numerically but would leave every later proof
carrying a well-definedness obligation that the `Sym2.lift` formulation discharges once.

**The empty cases are not special-cased.** The empty product is `1`, and the probability-measure
instance for `Measure.pi` makes its integral `1`, including when the vertex type is empty. Nothing
here needs a nonempty-carrier hypothesis.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.edgeFactor` — the value of `W` on one edge, orientation-free;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.homDensity` — the density `t(F, W)`.

## Main results

* `edgeFactor_congr` — an edge factor depends only on the assignment along that edge;
* `edgeFactor_map` — an edge factor is read along a map of vertex sets by pulling the assignment
  back;
* `measurable_prod_edgeFactor`, `prod_edgeFactor_nonneg`, `prod_edgeFactor_le_one` and
  `integrable_prod_edgeFactor` — the basic analytic facts about a finite product of edge factors,
  each edge read in its own graphon.  The integrand of `homDensity` is the special case of one
  graphon on the edges of `F`, and the telescoping proof of the counting lemma needs the general
  form;
* `homDensity_nonneg`, `homDensity_le_one` — `t(F, W) ∈ [0, 1]`, with no hypotheses;
* `homDensity_const` — the Erdős–Rényi value `t(F, W_p) = p ^ e(F)`, the first real consumer of both
  the graphon carrier and this definition.

* Roadmap: `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/DenseGraphLimits/README.md`, Layer 1 — `homDensity` and the
  constant-graphon value. The counting lemmas, `cutNorm`, finite-graph compatibility with
  `homDensityFin`, disjoint-union multiplicativity, and the catalogue of small-graph integrals are
  separate targets and are not built here.
