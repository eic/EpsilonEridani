# Symmetric kernels

A **symmetric kernel** on a measure space `(Ω, μ)` is an honest, everywhere-defined function
`Ω → Ω → ℝ` that is symmetric, jointly measurable, and uniformly bounded. It is the carrier the
dense graph limit theory is built on: a graphon is a `[0, 1]`-valued symmetric kernel, and the cut
norm is defined on kernels rather than on graphons precisely so that a *difference* `U - W` of two
graphons is in its domain.

**Strict, not `AEEqFun`.** The kernel carries a genuine function, not an a.e.-equivalence class.
The a.e. identification is taken once and later, at `GraphonSpace`, rather than being built into the
basic object. Two things follow, and they are why the roadmap makes this choice. First, the strict
kernel is a *pointwise* `ℝ`-module — `(U - W) x y = U x y - W x y` holds on the nose, so cut-norm
estimates never carry a null-set side condition. Second, pointwise hypotheses such as
`∀ x y, W x y ∈ Set.Icc 0 1` are stateable at all, which an a.e. class cannot support without
choosing a representative.

**The measure is a phantom parameter.** `SymmKernel Ω μ` does not mention `μ` in any field: none of
symmetry, measurability, or boundedness refers to it. It is carried in the type so that kernels over
different measures on the same space are not silently interchangeable, and so that later
measure-dependent structure (the cut norm, the `GraphonSpace` quotient) has somewhere to attach.
Consequently the algebra below needs no hypothesis on `μ` at all — in particular not
`IsProbabilityMeasure`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.SymmKernel` — the strict symmetric kernel structure, with a `FunLike`
  coercion, extensionality by the underlying function, and `symm` / `measurable` / `exists_bound`
  accessors.
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.SymmKernel.comap` — the pullback of a kernel along a measurable map,
  acting on both arguments.

## Main results

* `AddCommGroup` and `Module ℝ` instances, defined pointwise. The `coe_zero`, `coe_add`, `coe_neg`,
  `coe_sub` and `coe_smul` simp lemmas identify every operation with the corresponding operation on
  `Ω → Ω → ℝ`, so the module structure can be computed entirely by `simp`.
* `SymmKernel.integrable_uncurry` says that a bounded kernel is integrable on the product of two
  finite copies of its measure.
* `comap_apply` evaluates a pullback, and `comap_zero` / `comap_add` / `comap_neg` / `comap_sub` /
  `comap_smul` say that pulling back is linear, so a pullback of a difference of kernels is the
  difference of the pullbacks. `comap_id` and `comap_comap` are the functoriality laws.

## Implementation

Each operation must re-establish all three fields. Symmetry and measurability are immediate.
Boundedness is where the constants are chosen: `C + D` for a sum or difference, `C` for a negation,
and `|c| * C` for a scalar multiple. Since the bound is existential (`∃ C, ∀ x y, |K x y| ≤ C`)
rather than a fixed constant, no sharpness is claimed or needed.

The algebraic instances are then transported along the injective coercion with
`Function.Injective.addCommGroup` and `Function.Injective.module`, which is what makes the pointwise
formulas definitional.

  `Graphon` structure, `cutNorm`, homomorphism densities, and the `L⁰`-to-strict representative
  bridge are separate targets and are not built here.

section Comap

variable {Ω' Ω'' : Type*} [MeasurableSpace Ω'] [MeasurableSpace Ω'']

/-- The **pullback of a symmetric kernel along a measurable map** `f : Ω' → Ω`, acting on both
arguments: `K.comap f hf μ' x y = K (f x) (f y)`.

Symmetry, measurability and boundedness are all inherited from `K`, so no hypothesis beyond
measurability of `f` is needed — and none on either measure, since `μ` and `μ'` are phantom
parameters of the two kernel types. The map comes first, as it does for
`ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.comap`; the target measure `μ'` trails it as an explicit argument,
because it is not determined by the data.

This is how a kernel on one carrier is read on another. Two uses in the dense graph limit theory:
the **overlaid difference** on a coupling of two carriers is the difference of the two pullbacks
along the coordinate projections, and the measure-preserving-map form of the cut distance compares
pullbacks along maps out of a common carrier. -/
