# Expected homomorphism densities in graphon samples

For a fixed finite graph `F`, the expected ordinary homomorphism density of `F` in a graphon
sample `G(n, W)` converges to the graphon homomorphism density `t(F, W)`. At every finite
sample size `n ≥ |V(F)|`, the difference is at most `|V(F)|.choose 2 / n`.

The proof compares the ordinary homomorphism density with the injective density. The injective
density is exactly unbiased under graphon sampling, while the two finite densities differ only
when a sampled vertex map has a collision.

## Main results

* `SimpleGraph.abs_integral_homDensityFin_sampleGraph_sub_le` bounds the finite-sample bias of
  the ordinary homomorphism density for samples with at least `|V(F)|` vertices;
* `SimpleGraph.tendsto_integral_homDensityFin_sampleGraph` gives convergence of its
  expectation to the graphon homomorphism density.
