# Consistency of graphon sampling under restriction of labels

Sampling `l` independent points from a graphon and then tossing an independent coin for each
unordered pair produces a law on `SimpleGraph (Fin l)`. Restricting such a sample to a window of
`k` labels is the same as running the `k`-point sampling procedure from the start: the window
reads `k` of the `l` independent points, which are again independent with the same law, and the
coins outside the window are simply not looked at.

The combinatorial half is that the graphs on `Fin l` restricting to a fixed `H` along an
injection `f` are exactly the graphs whose edges meet the window `⊤.map f` in the image of the
edges of `H`. Summing the conditional masses over that family collapses the coins outside the
window, leaving the conditional mass of `H` at the restricted positions. The probabilistic half is
that restricting an independent family of positions along an injection is measure preserving.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.sum_sampleIntegrand_comap_eq` — at fixed positions, the conditional
  masses of the graphs restricting to `H` sum to the conditional mass of `H` at the restricted
  positions;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.sum_sampleMass_comap_eq` — the same identity after integrating out
  the positions;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.sampleGraph_map_comap` — the sampling laws are consistent under
  restriction along every injection of labels.

  here is written for Tau Ceti's strict graphon carrier and reduces the combinatorial step to the
  prescribed-trace mass formula.
