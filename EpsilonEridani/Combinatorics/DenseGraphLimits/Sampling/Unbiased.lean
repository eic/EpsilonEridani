# Unbiased injective homomorphism densities

The injective homomorphism density of a finite pattern in a graph sampled from a graphon is an
unbiased estimator of the graphon's homomorphism density. The proof first establishes the basic
upper-event identity: the total sampling mass of all supergraphs of `F` is `t(F, W)`. It then
averages that identity over every embedding of the pattern's vertices into the sampled vertex set.

The falling factorial counts ordered vertex embeddings and therefore matches the injective maps in
the numerator of `injHomDensity`. The hypothesis that the sample contains at least as many vertices
as the pattern makes this denominator nonzero.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.sum_sampleMass_supergraph_eq_homDensity` — the probability that the
  sample contains every edge of `F` is `t(F, W)`;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.integral_injHomDensity_eq_sum_div` — the average of the injective
  homomorphism density against any finite measure on host graphs, as an average over vertex
  embeddings of the mass of the hosts containing the embedded pattern;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.integral_injHomDensity_eq_of_forall` — if every embedded copy of the
  pattern has the same host mass `c`, the average injective homomorphism density is `c`;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.abs_integral_homDensityFin_sub_integral_injHomDensity_le` — under any
  probability measure on host graphs, the mean ordinary and injective homomorphism densities differ
  by at most `C(k, 2) / n`;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.integral_injHomDensity_sampleGraph` — injective homomorphism density is
  unbiased under graphon sampling.
