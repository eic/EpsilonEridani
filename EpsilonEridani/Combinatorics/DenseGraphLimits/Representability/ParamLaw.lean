# The exchangeable graph law of a graph parameter

A graph parameter `f` satisfying the four structural conditions of the Lovász–Szegedy
representability theorem — isomorphism invariance, multiplicativity, normalization and reflection
positivity — defines a random graph: its level-`n` law gives each graph `H` on `Fin n` the Möbius
mass `f†(H)`.  The Möbius masses are nonnegative and sum to one at each level, and they are
consistent along label injections, so these laws form an exchangeable graph law `L_f`.  By Möbius
inversion its upper masses `P(F ≤ ·)` are the values `f(F)`, and multiplicativity of `f` then says
exactly that `L_f` is dissociated.

This is the random object behind the classical proof of representability: a dissociated
exchangeable graph law is the sampling law of a graphon `W`, whose upper masses are the homomorphism
densities `t(·, W)`, so `f = t(·, W)`.  No graphon is involved in the construction here.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.paramGraphLaw` — the measure on the graphs on `Fin n` with mass `f†(H)`
  at each `H`, as a weighted sum of Dirac masses;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.paramExchangeableLaw` — the exchangeable graph law `L_f` with these
  level measures.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.paramGraphLaw_apply` — the mass of a set of graphs is the sum of the
  clipped nonnegative Möbius weights of its members;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.isProbabilityMeasure_paramGraphLaw` — each level is a probability
  measure;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.paramGraphLaw_map_comap` — the levels are consistent along label
  injections;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.paramExchangeableLaw_upperMass` — the upper masses of `L_f` are the
  values of `f`;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.isDissociated_paramExchangeableLaw` — `L_f` is dissociated.

## Implementation

The weights of `paramGraphLaw` are `ENNReal.ofReal (f†(H))`, so the measure is defined for every
parameter; the structural conditions enter only through the theorems.  Nonnegativity of `f†`, a
consequence of isomorphism invariance and reflection positivity, is what makes these weights
faithful to the real identities of the Möbius calculus, which is why reflection positivity is a
hypothesis of the consistency theorem even though the underlying identity
`graphParamMobius_sum_comap` does not need it.
