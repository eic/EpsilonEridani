# The infinite graphon sampler as an exchangeable law

There are two constructions of an infinite random graph associated to a graphon. The explicit
joint sampler `infiniteSampleLaw` draws all vertex positions and edge coins on one probability
space. Independently, the finite sampling laws form `sampleExchangeableLaw`, whose consistent
marginals have a unique extension to an infinite exchangeable law through
`exchangeableGraphLawEquivInfinite`.

This file identifies those constructions. They have the same restriction to every finite window,
so extensionality of measures on infinite graphs shows that their laws agree. In particular, the
explicit joint sampling law is invariant under every permutation of its vertex labels.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.infiniteSampleLaw_eq_extension` — the explicit joint sampler is the
  infinite extension of its finite sampling laws;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.infiniteSampleLaw_map_comap` — the explicit joint sampler is invariant
  under relabelling by every permutation of `ℕ`.
