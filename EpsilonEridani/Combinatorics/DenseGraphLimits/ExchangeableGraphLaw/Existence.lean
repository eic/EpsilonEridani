# Every exchangeable graph law is a graphon mixture

Every exchangeable graph law is the mixture law of some probability measure on the graphon space
over the unit interval (`exists_mixtureExchangeableLaw_eq`). This is the existence half of the
Diaconis–Janson correspondence between exchangeable graph laws and graphon mixtures, obtained from
graphon-space compactness with no array-level input. It asserts only that a mixing measure exists:
it makes no claim of uniqueness and picks no canonical one.

Compactness enters through the space of mixing measures: every sequence of probability measures
on the compact graphon space has a weakly convergent subsequence
(`exists_subseq_tendsto_probabilityMeasure`). Applied to the empirical mixing measures of a law,
the limit of such a subsequence represents the law by
`mixtureExchangeableLaw_eq_of_tendsto_empiricalMixing`.

  the mixture law of a probability measure on `GraphonSpaceI`.**
