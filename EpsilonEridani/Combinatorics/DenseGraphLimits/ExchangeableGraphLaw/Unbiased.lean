# Homomorphism densities of samples from an exchangeable graph law

The level-`m` marginal of an exchangeable graph law `L` is a random `m`-vertex graph. This file
compares the mean homomorphism densities of such a sample with the upper masses of `L`. The
injective density is exact: by consistency of `L`, each of the `(m)_k` vertex embeddings of a
`k`-vertex pattern `F` sees the pattern with probability `upperMass F`, so
`E[t₀(F, G)] = upperMass F` whenever `k ≤ m`. The ordinary density differs from it by at most
`C(k, 2) / m`, the union bound on the proportion of non-injective vertex maps.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.ExchangeableGraphLaw.integral_injHomDensity_law` — the injective
  homomorphism density of a sample from an exchangeable graph law is an unbiased estimator of the
  upper mass;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.ExchangeableGraphLaw.abs_integral_homDensityFin_law_sub_upperMass_le` —
  the mean ordinary homomorphism density of a sample is within `C(k, 2) / m` of the upper mass.

/-- **Unbiasedness of the injective density.** The injective homomorphism density of a pattern in
a sample from an exchangeable graph law is an unbiased estimator of the pattern's upper mass,
provided the sample has at least as many vertices as the pattern: by consistency of the law, each
vertex embedding of the pattern sees it with probability equal to the upper mass. -/

/-- **Near-unbiasedness of the ordinary density.** The mean ordinary homomorphism density of a
`k`-vertex pattern in an `m`-vertex sample from an exchangeable graph law is within `C(k, 2) / m` of
the pattern's upper mass. The bound holds for every positive sample size, and is informative only
when `k ≤ m`, since `C(k, 2) / m ≥ 1` once `k > m`. -/
