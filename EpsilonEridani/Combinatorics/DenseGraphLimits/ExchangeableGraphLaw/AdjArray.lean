# The adjacency array of a graph and the graph of an array

The adjacency array `SimpleGraph.adjArray G` of a graph on `ℕ` is symmetric with `false` diagonal.
An array is read back as a graph by `graphOfArray`, the `SimpleGraph.fromRel` of the array: `i` and
`j` are adjacent when they are distinct and the array is `true` at `(i, j)` or at `(j, i)`. The two
are mutually inverse on the symmetric arrays with `false` diagonal and intertwine relabelling of the
graph with the diagonal relabelling of the array. The adjacency array itself, its measurability and
its injectivity are in `SimpleGraph/Maps.lean` and `SimpleGraph/Measurable.lean`.

## Main results

* `SimpleGraph.adjArray_mem_symmetricArraysWithDiag`, `SimpleGraph.adjArray_comap` — the
  adjacency array of a graph on `ℕ` lies in the carrier and intertwines relabelling.
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.graphOfArray`, `graphOfArray_adj`, `measurable_graphOfArray`,
  `graphOfArray_pairReindex`.
* `SimpleGraph.graphOfArray_adjArray`, `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.adjArray_graphOfArray` — the
  two round trips.

## References

* P. Diaconis, S. Janson, *Graph limits and exchangeable random graphs*, Rend. Mat. Appl. (7) 28
  (2008), 33–61, Section 5: exchangeable random graphs as symmetric zero-diagonal arrays.

No material is adapted from `cameronfreer/graphon`; the adjacency array is read directly from
Mathlib's adjacency relation, and the relabelling square is `SimpleGraph.comap_adj`.
