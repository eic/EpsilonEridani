# Uniform mixtures of dissociated exchangeable graph laws

Every exchangeable law on infinite graphs is a measurable mixture of dissociated exchangeable
graph laws, with one uniform variable on the unit interval as the mixing variable
(`InfiniteExchangeableGraphLaw.exists_dissociated_kernel`): the components are exchangeable
probability measures on the graphs on `ℕ`, almost all of them dissociated, and their mixture
against the uniform law is the original law. This is the ergodic decomposition of an
exchangeable graph law, with the extreme laws (`mem_extremePoints_iff_isDissociated`) as
components; by `InfiniteExchangeableGraphLaw.ae_eq_of_comp_eq` a dissociated law is its own only
decomposition. Representing the components by graphons is a separate step.

The graph decomposition is the array decomposition of the adjacency array
(`JointlyExchangeable.exists_dissociated_kernel`) viewed on graphs: its components are the
decoded components of the array decomposition, and the mixing variable is the same.

`MeasureTheory.Measure.IsDissociatedGraphLaw` packages the
exchangeable probability measures on graphs whose finite law is dissociated, so that a component
of the decomposition is described by one predicate.

## Main results

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.IsDissociatedGraphLaw` — dissociated exchangeable
  probability measures on graphs, with `isDissociatedGraphLaw_iff` and its extreme-point form
  `isDissociatedGraphLaw_iff_mem_extremePoints`.
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.InfiniteExchangeableGraphLaw.exists_dissociated_kernel` — **every
  exchangeable graph law is a uniform mixture of dissociated exchangeable graph laws.**
