# Every graphon is pulled back from a standard Borel carrier

A graphon is jointly measurable, so it depends on only countably many measurable sets of each
argument: it factors as `W x y = V (q x) (q y)` through a measurable `q : Ω → ℕ → Bool` into the
Cantor space, and the factor `V` is again symmetric and `[0, 1]`-valued
(`EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.Graphon.exists_comap_natBool`). Since `q` is measure preserving
onto the pushforward `μ.map q`, this presents an arbitrary graphon as a pullback
`W = V.comap q` of a graphon on a **standard Borel** probability carrier.

This is the carrier-free half of Janson's Lemma 7.3, and it is what removes the standard Borel
hypothesis from the arguments that need one: the measure-theoretic input has no hypothesis on `Ω`
at all, because the factorization happens before any measure is involved.

Symmetry and the range constraint are *retained*, not re-imposed: the factor produced by the
measurable factorization need be neither, so it is averaged with its transpose and truncated to
`[0, 1]`. Both operations are invisible on the image of `q`, where the values are already
symmetric and in `[0, 1]`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.Graphon.exists_comap_natBool` — every graphon is the pullback,
  along a measurable map to the Cantor space, of a graphon on the pushforward measure.

/-- **Every graphon is a pullback from a standard Borel carrier** (Janson, Lemma 7.3). There is a
measurable `q : Ω → ℕ → Bool` and a graphon `V` on the Cantor space, carrying the pushforward
measure `μ.map q`, with `W = V.comap q`; no hypothesis on `Ω` is needed.

The map `q` is measure preserving from `μ` onto `μ.map q` by construction, so `W` and `V` have the
same observables; this is the reduction that lets a statement proved over standard Borel carriers
be transported to an arbitrary probability carrier. -/
