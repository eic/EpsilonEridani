# Graphons

A **graphon** on a probability space `(Ω, μ)` is a `[0, 1]`-valued symmetric kernel: an
everywhere-defined `W : Ω → Ω → ℝ` that is symmetric, jointly measurable, and takes values in
`[0, 1]`. It is the limit object of the dense graph limit theory.

**A graphon is a kernel with a range constraint, not a new carrier.** `Graphon` extends
`SymmKernel`, so symmetry and measurability are inherited rather than restated, and every
kernel-level construction applies to a graphon through `Graphon.toSymmKernel`. That projection is
what lets the cut norm — defined on kernels, so that a *difference* `U - W` of graphons is in its
domain — be applied to graphons without a second definition.

**Graphons carry no algebra.** They are deliberately not an `AddCommGroup` or a `Module`: the
`[0, 1]` constraint is not preserved by addition, negation, or scaling, so `U - W` is a kernel and
not a graphon. This is exactly why the roadmap puts the cut norm on `SymmKernel` and the range
constraint here.

**The measure is a genuine parameter here.** Unlike `SymmKernel`, whose measure is a phantom
argument, `Graphon` requires `[IsProbabilityMeasure μ]`: the analytic theory built on graphons —
homomorphism densities, the cut metric, sampling — integrates against `μ` and needs total mass one.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.Graphon` — the `[0, 1]`-valued symmetric kernel, with a `FunLike`
  coercion, extensionality by the underlying function, and the `toSymmKernel` projection.
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.Graphon.const` — the constant graphon with value `p : I`.
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.Graphon.clampSymm` — turn a measurable real-valued kernel into a
  graphon by averaging with its transpose and clamping to `[0, 1]`.

## Main results

* `Graphon.symm`, `Graphon.measurable` — symmetry and joint measurability, inherited from the
  kernel;
* `Graphon.nonneg`, `Graphon.le_one` — the pointwise range constraint, in eliminator form;
* `Graphon.const_apply` — the constant graphon evaluates to its parameter.
* `Graphon.clampSymm_apply_of_symm_of_mem` — symmetrizing and clamping leaves a symmetric value
  already in `[0, 1]` unchanged.

  constant graphon. The signature follows `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/DenseGraphLimits/Suggested.lean`.
  Homomorphism densities, the cut norm and cut distance, the `GraphonSpace` quotient and its
  a.e.-identification, and the step graphon of a finite graph are separate targets and are not built
  here.
