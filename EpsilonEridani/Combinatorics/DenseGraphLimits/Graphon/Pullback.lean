# Reading a graphon on another carrier

A graphon on `(Ω, μ)` may be read on any other probability space through a measurable map
`f : Ω' → Ω`, by evaluating it at the images of both arguments:
`W.comap f hf μ' x y = W (f x) (f y)`. Symmetry, measurability and the `[0, 1]` range all survive,
so the result is again a graphon.

This is `SymmKernel.comap` with the range constraint carried along, and it is the object that makes
the cross-carrier theory run: the two graphons compared by the cut distance live on different
spaces, and a coupling `π` of their carriers turns both into graphons on `(Ω₁ × Ω₂, π)` — the
pullbacks along the two coordinate projections, whose difference is
`EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.overlayDiff`. Nothing here needs `f` to be measure preserving; that
hypothesis enters only where an *integral* is transported, as in
`EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.homDensity_comap`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.Graphon.comap` — the pullback of a graphon along a measurable map.

## Main results

* `Graphon.comap_apply` — the eliminator `W.comap f hf μ' x y = W (f x) (f y)`;
* `Graphon.toSymmKernel_comap` — the pullback of a graphon is the pullback of its kernel, which is
  how the cut norm and the kernel algebra see it;
* `Graphon.comap_id`, `Graphon.comap_comap`, `Graphon.comap_const` — functoriality and the constant
  graphon.

* Roadmap: `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/DenseGraphLimits/README.md`, Layer 1 — the basic API of the `Graphon`
  object, and the cross-carrier reading of two graphons through a coupling that the
  coupling-primary `cutDist` rests on.

/-- The **pullback of a graphon along a measurable map** `f : Ω' → Ω`, acting on both arguments:
`W.comap f hf μ' x y = W (f x) (f y)`.

The underlying kernel is `SymmKernel.comap`, so symmetry, measurability and boundedness are
inherited from there; the `[0, 1]` range is inherited pointwise. As for kernels, no hypothesis on
either measure is needed — `μ'` only has to be a probability measure for the result to be a
*graphon* at all.

The argument order follows `SymmKernel.comap`: the map first, then its measurability, then the
carrier measure of the result, which the data does not determine. -/
