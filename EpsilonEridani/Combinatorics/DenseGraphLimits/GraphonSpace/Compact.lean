# Graphon space is compact

The canonical graphon space `GraphonSpaceI` is a compact metric space (the
Lovász--Szegedy compactness theorem). It combines completeness of unit-interval graphons
with total boundedness of their cut-distance quotient.

Compactness passes to the mixing measures: `ProbabilityMeasure GraphonSpaceI` is compact and
metrizable (the compact-space direction of Prokhorov's theorem), so every sequence of probability
measures on the graphon space has a weakly convergent subsequence
(`exists_subseq_tendsto_probabilityMeasure`).

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.GraphonSpaceI.instCompactSpace` -- `GraphonSpaceI` is compact.
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.exists_subseq_tendsto_probabilityMeasure` -- every sequence of
  probability measures on `GraphonSpaceI` has a weakly convergent subsequence.

weakly convergent subsequence: the graphon space is a compact metric space, so its space of
probability measures is compact and metrizable (the compact-space direction of Prokhorov's
