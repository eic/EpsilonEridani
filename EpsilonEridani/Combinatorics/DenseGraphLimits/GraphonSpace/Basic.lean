# The metric space of graphons

The coupling cut distance is a pseudometric on graphons over a fixed probability carrier.  This
file forms the separation quotient of that pseudometric, identifying two representatives exactly
when their cut distance is zero.  The quotient carries the resulting genuine metric.

The quotient is fixed-carrier: `GraphonSpace Ω μ` contains graphons on `(Ω, μ)`.  Graphons on
different carriers are still compared by the cross-carrier `cutDist`; they are not bundled into a
single universe-level quotient.  The abbreviation `GraphonSpaceI` names the canonical quotient on
the unit interval.

Two graphons at cut distance zero — for instance a graphon and any measure-preserving
rearrangement of it — are topologically indistinguishable in the cut-metric topology, so the
identification that turns the pseudometric into a metric is exactly the separation quotient of the
strict graphon type.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.GraphonSpace` is the corresponding fixed-carrier quotient;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.GraphonSpaceI` is the quotient over the unit interval;
* graphon space carries the Borel σ-algebra of the cut metric, so probability measures on it —
  the mixing measures of exchangeable graph laws — are available.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.dist_graphonSpace_mk_mk` computes the quotient distance on
  representatives;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.graphonSpace_mk_eq_mk_iff` characterises equality of representatives.
