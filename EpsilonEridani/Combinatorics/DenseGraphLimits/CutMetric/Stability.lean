# Stability of graphon cut distance under approximation

The coupling cut distance is stable when either graphon is replaced by a nearby graphon on the
same carrier.  Quantitatively,

`|δ□(U, W) - δ□(U', W')| ≤ ‖U - U'‖□ + ‖W - W'‖□`.

This estimate does not use the triangle inequality for `cutDist`.  Instead, fix a coupling used to
compare `U'` and `W`.  On that coupling, the overlaid difference of `U` and `W` splits into the
pullback of `U - U'` plus the overlaid difference of `U'` and `W`.  The cut-norm triangle
inequality bounds the sum, and invariance under the measure-preserving coordinate projection
identifies the first summand with `‖U - U'‖□`.  Taking the infimum over the same couplings gives the
one-coordinate estimate; symmetry and a second replacement give the displayed bound.

The result is the stability input for the finite-step reduction in the arbitrary-carrier triangle
inequality.  Once graphons have been approximated by finite step graphons, a triangle estimate for
the finite approximants transfers to the original graphons with precisely the two cut-norm errors
recorded here.  Thus no disintegration of an arbitrary intermediate carrier is hidden in this
module.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.abs_cutDist_sub_left_le_cutNorm` bounds the effect of changing the
  graphon on the left carrier.
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.abs_cutDist_sub_right_le_cutNorm` is the corresponding bound on the
  right carrier.
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.abs_cutDist_sub_le_cutNorm_add_cutNorm` changes both graphons at once.
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.cutDist_le_add_two_mul_cutNorm_of_le_add` transfers a triangle
  estimate proved with an approximating intermediate graphon back to the original intermediate.

/-- **Transfer of a triangle estimate from an approximating intermediate graphon.**  Suppose a
triangle estimate has been proved with `W'` as the intermediate graphon.  Replacing `W'` by a
graphon `W` on the same carrier costs at most twice `‖W - W'‖□`, once for each leg of the triangle.

The finite-step reduction uses this with `W'` a step approximation of `W`: finite-middle coupling
gluing supplies the hypothesis, and letting the cut-norm error tend to zero yields the desired
triangle estimate through `W`. -/
