# Reading a graphon on the unit interval

Every standard Borel probability space receives a measure-preserving map out of `(I, volume)`
(Janson, Theorem A.9), and the cut distance does not change when a graphon is read along a
measure-preserving map (`cutDist_comap_right`). Pulling a graphon back along such a map therefore
puts it on the canonical carrier `(I, volume)` at no cost.

The map is an arbitrary choice, and so is the representative built from it; what is canonical is
its cut class, which is what `cutDist_unitIntervalModel` records.

The standard Borel hypothesis the map theorem needs costs nothing, because every graphon is
already a pullback from a standard Borel carrier
(`EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.Graphon.exists_comap_natBool`, Janson, Lemma 7.3): a jointly
measurable kernel reads only countably many measurable sets of each argument. Composing the two
reductions puts *every* graphon, on an arbitrary probability carrier, at cut distance zero from
one on the unit interval (Janson, Theorem 7.1) -- the carrier-free representation the separation
converse runs on.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.unitIntervalModel` -- the `(I, volume)` representative of a graphon on
  a standard Borel probability carrier.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.cutDist_unitIntervalModel` -- cut distances to a graphon are unchanged
  by reading it on the unit interval;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.exists_graphon_unitInterval_cutDist_eq_zero` -- every graphon, on an
  arbitrary probability carrier, is at cut distance zero from one on the unit interval.

/-- The `(I, volume)` representative of a graphon on a standard Borel probability carrier: its
pullback along a measure-preserving map out of the unit interval (Janson, Thm A.9).

The map is an arbitrary choice; `cutDist_unitIntervalModel` shows that no cut distance to the
graphon depends on it. -/

/-- **Every graphon is at cut distance zero from a graphon on the unit interval** (Janson,
Thm 7.1), with **no hypothesis on its carrier**: the unit interval sees every graphon up to cut
distance, so a cross-carrier statement invariant under `cutDist = 0` may be proved there.

The carrier is reduced in two steps, neither of which moves the cut class: a graphon is first
rewritten as a pullback from a standard Borel carrier
(`EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.Graphon.exists_comap_natBool`), which `unitIntervalModel` then
reads on the unit interval. -/
