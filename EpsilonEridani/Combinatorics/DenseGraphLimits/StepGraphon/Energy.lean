# The graphon partition energy

The Frieze--Kannan weak regularity argument is a potential argument: refine a measurable finite
partition as long as the block-average step graphon fails to approximate the graphon in cut norm,
and bound the number of refinements by the growth of an `L²` potential that is trapped in `[0, 1]`.
This file builds that potential.

`graphonPartitionEnergy μ P hP W` is the `L²(μ ⊗ μ)` norm squared of the block-average step graphon
`stepGraphonAvg`, that is of `E[W | P ⊗ P]`.  Its two structural properties are proved here:

* **projection moment.** Pairing `W` with its block-average step graphon gives the self-pairing of
  that block average (`l2inner_graphon_stepGraphonAvg`); hence the exact defect identity
  `l2sq_sub_stepGraphonAvg`.
* **Pythagoras.** Refining the partition increases the energy by exactly the `L²` norm squared of
  the change in the block-average step graphon (`graphonPartitionEnergy_increment`), so the energy
  is monotone under refinement.

Both rest on the same block computation: the energy is a finite sum of block contributions
(`graphonPartitionEnergy_eq_sum`), and a block average over a *refinement* still reproduces the
coarse block integrals (`stepGraphonAvg_rectIntegral_of_le_of_le`).  That last identity needs no
hypothesis excluding null parts: a null part of the finer partition cuts out a null rectangle,
which contributes zero to both sides whatever value the step graphon takes there.  The null-cell
convention of `stepGraphonAvg` is what makes it a well-defined strict `[0, 1]`-valued
representative at all — it is load-bearing for `stepGraphonAvg_idem` — but it is not what makes
this identity true.

This is `‖E[W | P ⊗ P]‖₂²` written entirely in terms of finite block averages; the identification
with `MeasureTheory.condExp` belongs to the later a.e. layer, and nothing here needs it.  It is also
distinct from Mathlib's `Finpartition.energy`, which is the finite edge-density energy of a finite
graph.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.graphonPartitionEnergy` is the graphon partition energy.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.stepGraphonAvg_rectIntegral_of_le_of_le`: block averaging over a
  refinement preserves rectangle integrals whose sides come from possibly different coarser
  partitions;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.l2inner_stepGraphonAvg_eq_sum`: the block computation everything else
  is read off from — pairing any kernel against a block-average step graphon;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.graphonPartitionEnergy_eq_sum`: the energy as a finite block sum;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.l2inner_graphon_stepGraphonAvg`: the projection moment identity, and
  `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.l2inner_stepGraphonAvg_of_le` is its refinement form;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.graphonPartitionEnergy_le_l2sq`: the corresponding Bessel-type bound;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.l2sq_sub_stepGraphonAvg`: the defect identity `‖W - E[W|P⊗P]‖₂² =
  ‖W‖₂² - E(P)`;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.graphonPartitionEnergy_increment`: the `L²`-Pythagoras increment;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.graphonPartitionEnergy_stepGraphonAvg`: averaging twice at the same
  partition changes nothing;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.graphonPartitionEnergy_mono`,
  `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.graphonPartitionEnergy_nonneg` and
  `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.graphonPartitionEnergy_le_one`: the bounded monotone potential.
