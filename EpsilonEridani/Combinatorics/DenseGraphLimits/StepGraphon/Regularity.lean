# Frieze--Kannan weak regularity for graphons

This file proves the weak regularity lemma for strict graphons.  Starting from the indiscrete
finite partition, a cut-norm witness for the current block-average defect cuts every part along
two measurable sets.  The common refinement has at most four times as many parts, while the
Pythagoras identity for `graphonPartitionEnergy` and Cauchy--Schwarz show that its energy rises by
at least `ε²`.  Since the energy stays in `[0, 1]`, the process stops after at most
`⌈1 / ε²⌉ + 1` steps.

Null parts need no special case: `Finpartition.bipartition` omits empty sets but retains nonempty
null sets, and `stepGraphonAvg` uses Mathlib's zero set-average convention on their rectangles.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.exists_refinement_energy_add_sq_le` is the quantitative refinement
  step: a bad cut-norm approximation yields an energy gain of at least `ε²` while multiplying the
  number of parts by at most four;
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.weak_regularity_frieze_kannan` is the roadmap's Layer-2 weak
  regularity theorem, with complexity `4 ^ (Nat.ceil (1 / ε ^ 2) + 1)`.

/-- The iteration invariant behind `weak_regularity_frieze_kannan`: **at most** `n` applications of
`exists_refinement_energy_add_sq_le` to a measurable partition `P` produce a measurable partition
with at most `4 ^ n` times as many parts, whose block averages either approximate `W` to within `ε`
in cut norm, or carry energy at least `n * ε ^ 2` above `P`'s. The count is only an upper bound
because the induction stops as soon as the cut-norm estimate holds, returning `P` itself; the
energy alternative is what records how many steps were actually taken. The conclusion records only
that part-count bound and that dichotomy — it does **not** assert that the partition produced
refines `P`, since nothing downstream needs it; the refinement relation is available one level
down, from `exists_refinement_energy_add_sq_le`. Applying it to the indiscrete partition with `n`
past `1 / ε ^ 2` makes the energy alternative contradict `graphonPartitionEnergy_le_one`, leaving
the approximation. -/
