# Approximation by block-average step graphons

On a countably generated probability space, the block averages of a graphon along the canonical
refining finite partitions converge to the graphon in `L¹`. The finite partitions generate the
ambient σ-algebra, so this is Lévy's upward theorem after identifying each block average with the
corresponding conditional expectation.

This gives a strict, finite-step approximation with convergence stated as vanishing `eLpNorm` at
exponent one.

## Main result

* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.countableStepGraphonAvg` is the canonical sequence of block-average
  step graphons, characterized by `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.countableStepGraphonAvg_def`.
* `EpsilonEridani.DenseGraphLimits.tendsto_eLpNorm_countableStepGraphonAvg` gives `L¹`
  convergence of canonical block averages.
