# Connectedness of a graph numbered so that neighbours descend

A graph on `Fin n` whose every vertex other than `0` has a neighbour with a smaller number is
connected: a strong induction on the number of a vertex walks it down to `0`. Numbering the
vertices of a diagram this way is what makes connectedness of the Dynkin diagrams, finite and
affine alike, a two-line check, and this file states the induction once for all of them.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.SimpleGraph.connected_fin_of_exists_adj_lt`: a graph on `Fin n` in which every nonzero
  vertex has an adjacent vertex with a smaller number is connected.
