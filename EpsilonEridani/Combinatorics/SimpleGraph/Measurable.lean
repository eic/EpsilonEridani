# Measurability of individual simple graphs and of relabelling

Mathlib equips `SimpleGraph V` with the sigma-algebra induced by all adjacency coordinates. When
`V` is countable, an individual graph is measurable because its edge set is a measurable point in
the countable product space. This supplies the discrete integration API for finite random graphs.

Each adjacency coordinate of a graph pulled back along a map of vertex types is a single
adjacency coordinate of the source graph, so the pullback is measurable with no hypothesis on
either vertex type. This is what lets a random graph be restricted to a window of labels: the
window `SimpleGraph.restrictFin` is the special case along `Fin.val`.

## Main results

* `SimpleGraph.instMeasurableSingletonClass` — singletons of graphs on a countable vertex type are
  measurable;
* `SimpleGraph.measurable_comap` — pulling back along a map of vertex types is measurable;
* `SimpleGraph.measurable_restrictFin` — taking a window is measurable.

## Reference

* C. Freer, `cameronfreer/graphon` at commit
  `6eccca5bbe5c9df46d7129bf59575b8b9b1d6699`, Apache-2.0, `Graphon/SamplingLaw.lean`. The
  instance is adapted from its measurable singleton instance; the proof here goes through
  Mathlib's `SimpleGraph.measurableEmbedding_edgeSet`.
