# Neighbours in a cycle graph

For `m ≥ 2`, Mathlib's `SimpleGraph.cycleGraph m` joins two elements of `Fin m` exactly when they
differ by one and records the neighbour set of a vertex as the pair `{v - 1, v + 1}`; for `m ≥ 3`,
it computes the degree to be two. This file derives the weaker fact valid for every nonzero `m`
that an adjacent vertex is the successor or predecessor, and shows that there are at most the two
neighbours `v + 1` and `v - 1`; when `m ≥ 3`, they are distinct and really are neighbours.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.eq_add_one_or_eq_add_one_of_cycleGraph_adj`: adjacent vertices differ by one.
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_or_eq_or_eq_of_cycleGraph_adj`: no vertex has three pairwise distinct neighbours,
  that is, every degree is at most two.
* `EpsilonEridani.cycleGraph_adj_add_one`: on at least three vertices a vertex is adjacent to its
  successor.
