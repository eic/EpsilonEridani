# Corners of a Young diagram

A *corner* of a Young diagram `μ` is a cell of `μ` with neither the cell to its right nor the cell
below it in `μ`.  Equivalently, the corners are the maximal cells of `μ`
(`YoungDiagram.IsCorner.eq_of_le`): they are exactly the cells `c` for which removing `c`
alone leaves a set of cells that is still a Young diagram.  So they index the ways of building `μ`
one cell at a time, and hence the recursions that count standard Young tableaux.  The corners are
also exactly the cells of hook length `1`, which is
`YoungDiagram.isCorner_iff_hookLength_eq_one` in
`EpsilonEridani.Combinatorics.Young.HookLength.Basic`, downstream of this file.

Deletion is `YoungDiagram.erase`.  It is defined without any hypothesis on the cell — it
removes the whole principal upper set of `c`, that is `c` together with every cell weakly below and
to the right of it — so that it can be summed over the corners of `μ` with no dependent index.  At a
corner, and only at a cell of `μ` that is a corner, nothing but `c` itself is removed
(`YoungDiagram.IsCorner.cells_erase`), and at a cell outside `μ` nothing is removed at all.

## Main definitions

* `YoungDiagram.IsCorner`: the predicate cutting out the corners of a diagram.
* `YoungDiagram.corners`: the corners of a diagram, as a `Finset`.
* `YoungDiagram.erase`: the diagram with the principal upper set of a cell removed.

## Main results

* `YoungDiagram.IsCorner.cells_erase`: erasing a corner deletes exactly that cell, and
  `YoungDiagram.IsCorner.card_erase`: it drops the number of cells by one.
* `YoungDiagram.exists_isCorner`: a nonempty Young diagram has a corner, so the corner
  recursions are not vacuous.
* `YoungDiagram.IsCorner.eq_of_fst_eq`: the corners of a diagram sit in distinct rows, and
  `YoungDiagram.IsCorner.fst_lt_colLen_zero`: those rows are rows of the diagram.
* `YoungDiagram.corners_transpose` and `YoungDiagram.erase_transpose`: corners and
  deletion commute with transposition.

below it in `μ`.  These are exactly the maximal cells of `μ`

set of cells that is still a Young diagram. -/

/-! ### Deleting a corner -/

/-- The Young diagram obtained from `μ` by deleting the cell `c` together with every cell weakly
below and to the right of it.

The definition is total, so that it can be summed over the corners of `μ` without a dependent index.
It is `Finset.erase` on cells exactly at a corner (`YoungDiagram.IsCorner.cells_erase`), and
it leaves `μ` unchanged at a cell outside `μ`
(`YoungDiagram.erase_eq_self_of_notMem`); at a cell of `μ` that is not a corner it deletes
the entire principal upper set of `c` in `μ`, which is the price of totality. -/
