# Finite sets of cells, closed in the row direction

A finite set `D : Finset (ι × κ)` of **cells** has its rows indexed by `ι` and its columns indexed
by `κ`. This file counts the cells of `D` one row at a time (`EpsilonEridani.CellDiagram.rowLen`), imposes
closure in the row direction (`EpsilonEridani.CellDiagram.IsRowLowerSet`: with every cell, `D` contains the
cells directly above it), and builds the set of cells lying under a prescribed tuple of row lengths
(`EpsilonEridani.CellDiagram.ofRowLens`).

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.CellDiagram.rowLen`: the number of cells of a set lying in a given row.
* `EpsilonEridani.CellDiagram.IsRowLowerSet`: the lower-set property in the row direction.
* `EpsilonEridani.CellDiagram.ofRowLens`: the cells lying under a tuple of row lengths.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.CellDiagram.isRowLowerSet_ofRowLens`: the cells under a weakly decreasing tuple of
  row lengths are closed in the row direction.
* `EpsilonEridani.CellDiagram.rowLen_ofRowLens` and `EpsilonEridani.CellDiagram.card_ofRowLens`: the rows of
  those cells have lengths `min (a i) m`, and there are `∑ i, min (a i) m` cells in all. When
  `∀ i, a i ≤ m`, the corresponding `of_le` corollaries give the prescribed row lengths and total.

## Implementation notes

Mathlib's `YoungDiagram` is a set of cells in `ℕ × ℕ` closed downwards in *both* directions, and
its rows are indexed by `ℕ`. The rows here are indexed by an abstract type `ι`, and only closure in
the row direction is imposed, because that is the condition the consumers need: it is exactly what
makes the raising operators of `gl ι` annihilate the wedge of the basis vectors indexed by the
cells, in `EpsilonEridani.isGlHighestWeightVector_basisWedge`.

/-! ### Closure in the row direction -/

/-- A set of cells is a **row lower set** when with every cell it contains all the cells directly
above it: if `(j, c)` is a cell and `i < j`, then `(i, c)` is a cell. In other words `D` is a lower
set in its row index. This is one of the two conditions on the shape of a Young diagram, the one in
the row direction; closure in the column direction is not imposed. -/
