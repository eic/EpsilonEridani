# Hook lengths after erasing a corner

Erasing a corner `c` from a Young diagram shortens precisely the hooks based strictly to the left
of `c` in its row and strictly above `c` in its column. The row- and column-length comparisons
live with the erasure API in `EpsilonEridani.Combinatorics.Young.Corner`; this file applies them to hook
lengths, proves the three pointwise cases, and packages them as a single conditional formula.

The final product identity rewrites the hook product of the smaller diagram entirely in terms of
the hooks of the original diagram. It is the local input needed to combine the corner recursion
for `standardCount` with the hook-product recurrence in the multiplicative hook-length formula.

## Main results

* `YoungDiagram.IsCorner.rowLen_erase` and `YoungDiagram.IsCorner.colLen_erase` describe the row and
  column lengths after a corner is erased.
* `YoungDiagram.IsCorner.hookLength_erase_of_same_row` and
  `YoungDiagram.IsCorner.hookLength_erase_of_same_col` say that the affected hooks drop by one.
* `YoungDiagram.IsCorner.hookLength_erase` is the combined pointwise comparison.
* `YoungDiagram.IsCorner.prod_hookLength_erase` compares the complete hook products.
