# Cycle data of permutation triples

The cycle data of a permutation triple records, in the ordered branch-point convention
`0, 1, ∞`, the full cycle partition of each component. These are the parts of Mathlib's
`Equiv.Perm.partition`, rather than `Equiv.Perm.cycleType`: fixed points therefore appear as
parts equal to one.

`EpsilonEridani.PermutationTriple.cycleData` packages the three partitions and
`EpsilonEridani.PermutationTriple.cycleCounts` packages their numbers of parts. The latter is expressed
using `EpsilonEridani.orbitCount`, and `cycleCounts_eq_card_cycleData` identifies the two descriptions.
The remaining results record that every partition sums to the degree and that both invariants are
unchanged by simultaneous relabeling, transport of the sheet type, inversion of the convention,
and isomorphism of triples.
