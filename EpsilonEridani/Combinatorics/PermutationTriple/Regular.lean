# Regular permutation triples

A connected permutation triple is *regular* when its automorphism group — the simultaneous
centralizer of its components — acts transitively on the sheets. These are the triples of the
regular (Galois, normal) three-point covers: those whose deck group acts transitively on a fiber.

For a connected triple the automorphism group always acts freely on the sheets
(`EpsilonEridani.PermutationTriple.eq_one_of_mem_automorphismGroup_of_apply_eq`), so a regular triple is
one whose automorphism group acts simply transitively. Dually, a triple is regular exactly when
its *monodromy* group acts freely: an element of the monodromy group fixing one sheet fixes every
translate of it by an automorphism, and conversely a free transitive monodromy action on `Fin n`
identifies the sheets with the monodromy group, on which right multiplications are automorphisms.
Counting then turns both characterisations into equalities of orders with the degree.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.PermutationTriple.IsRegular`: the triple is connected and its automorphism group is
  transitive on the sheets.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.PermutationTriple.isRegular_iff_isCancelSMul`: a triple is regular exactly when it is
  connected and its monodromy group acts freely on the sheets.
* `EpsilonEridani.PermutationTriple.isRegular_iff_card_monodromyGroup`: a triple is regular exactly when
  it is connected and its monodromy group has order the degree.
* `EpsilonEridani.PermutationTriple.isRegular_iff_card_automorphismGroup`: a triple is regular exactly
  when it is connected and its automorphism group has order the degree.
* `EpsilonEridani.PermutationTriple.isRegular_smul_iff`: regularity is invariant under relabeling.
