# Prefunctors on paths and on vertices

Elementary facts about a prefunctor `φ : Q ⥤q R` which `Prefunctor.mapPath` and `Prefunctor.comp`
leave unrecorded: pushing a path along `φ` preserves its length, a prefunctor with a two-sided
inverse is bijective on vertices, and a pair of composable one-sided inverse pairs composes to a
one-sided inverse pair.

## Main results

* `Prefunctor.length_mapPath`: pushing a path along a prefunctor preserves its length.
* `Prefunctor.obj_bijective_of_comp_eq_id`: mutually inverse prefunctors are bijective on vertices.
* `Prefunctor.comp_comp_comp_eq_id`: composing two one-sided inverse pairs of prefunctors gives a
  one-sided inverse pair.

## References

They all feed `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.mapAlgHom` in
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Quiver/PathAlgebra/Map.lean`, whose uniform hypothesis is
bijectivity on vertices, and the transport of the zigzag relations in
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Quiver/Zigzag/Isomorphism.lean`, which is stated in terms of path
lengths.

/-- **One-sided inverse pairs of prefunctors compose**: if `ψ` is a right inverse of `φ` and `ψ'`
one of `φ'`, then `ψ' ⋙q ψ` is a right inverse of `φ ⋙q φ'`. Applying this to a mutually inverse
pair in each order gives both inverse laws for the composite pair. -/
