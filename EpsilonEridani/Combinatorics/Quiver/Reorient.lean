# Reorienting a quiver

A `Bool`-valued labelling `σ` of the arrows of a quiver `Q` specifies a change of orientation: this
file builds the quiver `EpsilonEridani.Reorient Q σ`, whose arrows are those of `Q` with the ones labelled
`true` turned around.

The two doubled quivers `Quiver.Symmetrify (Reorient Q σ)` and `Quiver.Symmetrify Q` carry exactly
the same arrows, distributed differently between an arrow and its formal reverse. That is the
content of `EpsilonEridani.reorientSymmetrify` and `EpsilonEridani.reorientSymmetrifyInv`, mutually inverse
prefunctors which are the identity on vertices and commute with reversal. They are the
identification along which a construction on doubled quivers -- the additive preprojective algebra
-- is compared across a change of orientation.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Reorient`: the quiver `Q` with the arrows labelled `true` by `σ` turned around.
* `EpsilonEridani.reorientHomEquiv`: the identification of a hom set of `Reorient Q σ` with the two
  subtypes of hom sets of `Q` it is built from, together with `EpsilonEridani.reorientHom_induction_on` the
  general elimination interface for a reoriented arrow.
* `EpsilonEridani.reorientSymmetrify` and `EpsilonEridani.reorientSymmetrifyInv`: the two prefunctors between
  the doubled quivers.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.reorientSymmetrify_comp_reorientSymmetrifyInv` and
  `EpsilonEridani.reorientSymmetrifyInv_comp_reorientSymmetrify`: the two prefunctors are inverse, so the
  two doubled quivers are isomorphic.
* `EpsilonEridani.reorientSymmetrify_map_reverse`: the comparison commutes with arrow reversal.

## Implementation notes

`Reorient Q σ` is a semireducible type synonym for `Q`, following `Quiver.Symmetrify`: were it
reducible, instance search would unfold it and replace the reoriented quiver structure by that of
`Q`. Its arrows `i ⟶ j` are the disjoint union of the arrows `i ⟶ j` of `Q` which `σ` leaves alone
and the arrows `j ⟶ i` of `Q` which `σ` turns around, so a hom set of the doubled quiver
`Symmetrify (Reorient Q σ)` splits into four pieces. Sorting an arrow of `Symmetrify Q` into those
four pieces is what `EpsilonEridani.reorientSymmetrifyInv` does, and it is why that prefunctor, unlike its
inverse, is defined by a case distinction on the value of `σ`.

Turning around a *single* arrow is the special case where `σ` is supported on one arrow; allowing
an arbitrary `σ` performs an arbitrary composite of such flips in one step.
