# Powers of a closed path

A closed path `p : Quiver.Path a a` can be concatenated with itself, so it has powers
`p.loopPow n`, the path that runs around `p` exactly `n` times. Their lengths are the multiples
`n * p.length` of the length of `p`, so a *nontrivial* closed path has pairwise distinct powers
and the type of closed paths at `a` is infinite.

That last statement is the source of every "an oriented cycle makes something infinite" argument.
In `EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Acyclic.FinitePaths` it is what turns finiteness of the
path space into acyclicity, and through the path basis it is what makes the path algebra of a
quiver with an oriented cycle infinite-dimensional.

## Main definitions

* `Quiver.Path.loopPow`: the `n`-th power of a closed path, `p` concatenated with itself `n`
  times; the empty concatenation is `Quiver.Path.nil`.

## Main results

* `Quiver.Path.length_loopPow`: the `n`-th power of `p` has length `n * p.length`, and
  `Quiver.Path.loopPow_add` adds exponents, which is what makes `loopPow` a power.
* `Quiver.Path.loopPow_injective`: the powers of a closed path of positive length are pairwise
  distinct.
* `Quiver.Path.infinite_of_ne_nil`: **a nontrivial closed path forces infinitely many closed
  paths**, and `Quiver.Path.eq_nil_of_finite` is the contrapositive: at a vertex carrying finitely
  many closed paths, the trivial path is the only one.

## Implementation notes

The powers are stated for a closed path rather than for a general `p : Quiver.Path a b`, since
concatenating `p` with itself is what needs `a = b`. They are not packaged as a `Monoid` structure
on `Quiver.Path a a`: nothing here needs one, and it would put a multiplication on a type whose
elements already compose partially, as arbitrary paths.
