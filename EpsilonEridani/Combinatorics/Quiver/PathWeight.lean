# Additive path weights

Mathlib's `Quiver.Path.addWeight w p` sums the weights `w e` of the arrows along a path `p`. This
file records its evaluation at a constant weight: a constant weight `c` sums to `p.length • c`.
This identifies the path-length grading of a path algebra as the grading by the constant weight
one. It also records that pushing a path along a prefunctor sums the pulled-back arrow weight.

## Main results

* `Quiver.Path.addWeight_const`: the constant weight `c` gives a path the weight `p.length • c`.
* `Prefunctor.addWeight_mapPath`: the weight of a pushed path is the pulled-back weight of the
  original path.
