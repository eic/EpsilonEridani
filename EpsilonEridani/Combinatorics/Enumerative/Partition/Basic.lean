# Named partitions

This file records some partitions of `n` that are referred to by name.  Two of them are the
extremes: `Nat.Partition.ones n = (1ⁿ)`, the finest partition, into `n` parts equal to `1`, is the
opposite extreme to Mathlib's coarsest partition `Nat.Partition.indiscrete n = (n)`, whose parts
are the single part `n` when `n ≠ 0`, and none when `n = 0`.  The third is
`Nat.Partition.singletonSecondRow n = (n+1, 1)`, the partition of `n+2` with two parts whose
second part is a single box; it is written at `n+2` so that both parts are positive with no
hypothesis on `n`.

It also records `EpsilonEridani.parts_equivCast`, the transport of a partition along an equality of the
number being partitioned: such a transport leaves the parts alone.

/-- The partition `(1ⁿ)` of `n` into `n` parts, each equal to `1`.

This is the finest partition of `n`, opposite to Mathlib's coarsest `Nat.Partition.indiscrete n`,
whose parts are the single part `n` when `n ≠ 0`, and none when `n = 0`.

The parts are exposed only through `Nat.Partition.ones_parts`. -/

  simp [ones, Multiset.filter_eq_self, Multiset.mem_replicate]

/-- The product of the factorials of the parts of the coarsest partition `(n)` is `n !`.

For `n = 0` this is the empty product, and `0! = 1` agrees with it. -/

/-- The partition `(n+1, 1)` of `n+2`: two parts, the second a single box.

This is the shape usually written `(n-1, 1)` at `n`; writing it at `n+2` keeps both parts positive
with no hypothesis on `n`.  It is the unique shape with two rows whose second row is a single box,
and the coarsest shape other than `Nat.Partition.indiscrete`.

The parts are exposed only through `Nat.Partition.singletonSecondRow_parts`. -/
