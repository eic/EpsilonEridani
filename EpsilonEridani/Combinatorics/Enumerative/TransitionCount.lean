# Occurrence and transition counts of a finite word

A word `w : Fin N → α` over an arbitrary alphabet `α` has two elementary statistics: the
**occurrence count** `occCount w a`, the number of positions carrying the letter `a`, and — for a
word of length `n + 1` — the **transition count** `transitionCount w a b`, the number of positions
at which the letter `a` is immediately followed by the letter `b`.

The main result is that a word of positive length is determined up to rearrangement by its first
letter together with its transition counts:

`exists_perm_comp_of_transitionCount_eq`.

The mechanism is a conservation law. Summing `transitionCount w a ·` recovers the number of
positions other than the last carrying `a`, and summing `transitionCount w · a` recovers the number
of positions other than the first carrying `a`; comparing the two expressions for `occCount w a`
pins the last letter once the first letter is known, and then pins every occurrence count. Equal
occurrence counts glue the fibrewise bijections into a permutation of the positions.

This is the combinatorial heart of Markov exchangeability (Diaconis–Freedman), where the
transition counts of a path are the sufficient statistic: see
`EpsilonEridani/Probability/Exchangeability/MarkovExchangeable.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.occCount`: the number of positions of a word carrying a given letter.
* `EpsilonEridani.transitionCount`: the number of positions of a word at which a given ordered pair of
  letters occurs consecutively.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.occCount_eq_of_transitionCount_eq`: equal first letters and equal transition counts
  force equal occurrence counts.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_perm_comp_of_transitionCount_eq`: two such words are rearrangements of each
  other.
* `EpsilonEridani.consecutivePairs_append_cons`: splitting a word at a letter splits its consecutive
  pairs.
* `EpsilonEridani.transitionCount_getD`: the transition counts of a list, read as a `Fin`-indexed word,
  count its consecutive pairs.
* `EpsilonEridani.prod_consecutivePairs_getD`: a product of transition weights along a list, read as a
  `Fin`-indexed word, is the product over its consecutive pairs.
* `EpsilonEridani.prod_transitionCount`: a product of transition weights along a word depends on the word
  only through its transition counts.
* `EpsilonEridani.prod_eq_of_transitionCount_eq`: the resulting comparison of two words with equal
  transition counts.
