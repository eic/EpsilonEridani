# The excursion process of a sequence

Fix a state `a` of a sequence `x : ℕ → α`.  Its `k`-th excursion from `a` is the finite
list of values strictly between the `k`-th and `(k + 1)`-st visits to `a`.  This file defines that
list as `EpsilonEridani.excursion x a k` and packages the first `m` excursions as
`EpsilonEridani.excursionPrefix x a m`.

When the `m`-th visit exists, the visit times through `m` are genuine and strictly increasing.
The main reconstruction theorem then says that spelling out the first `m` excursions with
`EpsilonEridani.loopPath` recovers exactly the segment of `x` between its zeroth and `m`-th visits:

```text
loopPath a (excursionPrefix x a m)
  = (List.Ico (visitTime x a 0) (visitTime x a m + 1)).map x.
```

In particular this applies whenever `x` visits `a` infinitely often, and if `x 0 = a`, the result
is the initial path segment through its `m`-th return to `a`.  Read as an equivalence
(`EpsilonEridani.eqOn_loopPathAt_iff_excursionPrefix_eq`), this is the combinatorial bridge from the finite
excursion-reordering theorem in `EpsilonEridani.Probability.Exchangeability.Excursion` to the
exchangeability of the excursion process of a recurrent Markov exchangeable path, which is proved
in `EpsilonEridani.Probability.Exchangeability.Recurrence.Excursion`: a prescribed list of first
excursions is nothing but a prescribed finite path.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.excursion`: the finite word strictly between two consecutive visits to a state.
* `EpsilonEridani.excursionPrefix`: the list of the first `m` excursions.
* `EpsilonEridani.pathOfExcursions`: the sequence spelled out by a base state and an infinite sequence of
  excursions.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.not_mem_excursion`: an excursion does not visit its base state.
* `EpsilonEridani.loopPath_excursionPrefix`: the first excursions reconstruct the corresponding segment
  of the original sequence.
* `EpsilonEridani.loopSteps_excursionPrefix`: the number of reconstructed transitions is the difference
  of the endpoint visit times.
* `EpsilonEridani.visitCount_loopPathAt`: a loop visits its base state once per excursion.
* `EpsilonEridani.eqOn_loopPathAt_iff_excursionPrefix_eq`: for a path whose relevant return exists, having
  prescribed first excursions is the same as spelling out their loop word.
* `EpsilonEridani.pathOfExcursions_excursion`: a sequence that starts at a state and returns to it
  infinitely often is rebuilt from its own excursions.
* `EpsilonEridani.excursion_pathOfExcursions`: conversely, a sequence spelled out by excursions avoiding
  the base state has exactly those excursions.

For a sequence starting at `a` whose `bs.length`-th return to `a` exists, and a list `bs` of

* over the span `loopSteps bs` of the loop, the sequence agrees with the loop word of `bs`;
* the first `bs.length` excursions of the sequence are `bs`.

the sequence itself, which is the form Markov exchangeability constrains. -/
