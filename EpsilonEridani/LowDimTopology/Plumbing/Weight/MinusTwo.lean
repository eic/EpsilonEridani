# The canonical weight of an all-minus-two plumbing

When every sphere of a plumbing has self-intersection `-2`, its canonical characteristic
covector vanishes. The corresponding characteristic weight is therefore half the negative
self-intersection of a lattice point. When the self-pairing is nonpositive, this weight is
nonnegative with infimum zero; negative-definiteness further makes the origin its unique zero.

This identifies the bottom lattice point in the canonical spin-c structure of a
negative-definite all-`-2` plumbing. In particular it supplies the minimal generator needed to
compute the lattice homology of Dynkin plumbings such as the negative-definite `E8` plumbing.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.PlumbingGraph.canonicalCharacteristic_eq_zero_of_weight_eq_neg_two`: the canonical
  covector vanishes when every framing is `-2`.
* `EpsilonEridani.PlumbingGraph.characteristicWeight_canonical_of_weight_eq_neg_two`: the canonical
  weight is half the negative intersection-form self-pairing.
* `EpsilonEridani.PlumbingGraph.characteristicWeight_canonical_nonneg_of_weight_eq_neg_two` and
  `EpsilonEridani.PlumbingGraph.sInfCharacteristicWeight_canonical_eq_zero_of_weight_eq_neg_two`: when
  the self-pairing is nonpositive, this weight is nonnegative with infimum zero.
* `EpsilonEridani.PlumbingGraph.characteristicWeight_canonical_eq_zero_iff_of_weight_eq_neg_two`: on a
  negative-definite plumbing this weight has the origin as its unique zero.
