# The lattice complex has no homology in top cubical degree

`Bounded.lean` locates Némethi's lattice homology below the number of plumbing vertices only
because the chain groups themselves vanish there. This file removes the remaining top degree,
where the chain group is as large as it ever gets: the lattice differential is *injective* on
chains all of whose cubes carry the same nonempty direction set, and the top-degree chain group
`C_{card V}` is exactly such a piece. So `ℍ_q` vanishes for every `q ≥ Fintype.card V` as soon as
the plumbing has a vertex, and a one-vertex plumbing has its whole lattice homology concentrated
in cubical degree zero.

The mechanism is a maximal-coordinate argument, not a weight argument, so it needs no
negative-definiteness and no properness of the characteristic weight. Fix a direction `v` and a
cube `C₀` in the support whose base point has the largest `v`-coordinate. Its upper face
`(x₀ + E_v, S \ v)` in the direction `v` can be reached by only two cubes with direction set `S`:
as the upper face of `(x₀, S)` and as the lower face of `(x₀ + E_v, S)`. The second is barred by
maximality, so the coefficient of that face in the differential is a single power of `U` times the
coefficient of `C₀`, and multiplying by a power of `U` annihilates no nonzero polynomial. The
argument really does use a common direction set, and so does not run in lower degrees: there a
single codimension-one face is shared by cubes of different direction sets, and their
contributions can cancel.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.PlumbingGraph.latticeDifferentialOnGenerator_apply`: the coefficient of the weighted
  face sum of a cube at another cube.
* `EpsilonEridani.PlumbingGraph.latticeDifferential_ne_zero_of_directions_eq`: the lattice differential
  does not annihilate a nonzero chain whose cubes share a nonempty direction set, so it is
  injective on those chains.
* `EpsilonEridani.PlumbingGraph.latticeDifferentialDegree_injective_of_succ_eq_card`: in the top cubical
  degree the graded lattice differential is injective.
* `EpsilonEridani.PlumbingGraph.exactAt_latticeChainComplex_of_card_le` and
  `EpsilonEridani.PlumbingGraph.isZero_latticeChainHomology_of_card_le`: the complex is exact, and
  lattice homology vanishes, in every cubical degree at least the number of plumbing vertices,
  provided there is one.

That vanishing is not vacuous, and it is a statement about the differential rather than about the
chain groups: `isZero_latticeChainComplex_X_iff_card_lt` read at `q = Fintype.card V` says the
chain group in the top degree is nonzero. Read at `Fintype.card V = 1`,
`isZero_latticeChainHomology_of_card_le` says the whole lattice homology of a one-vertex plumbing
sits in cubical degree zero.

## References

This advances `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/CombinatorialHeegaardFloer/README.md`, Lane L ("lattice homology"),
which asks for Némethi's lattice homology together with computations for explicit plumbings: the
degrees in which the invariant can be nonzero have to be known before any of them is computed.
