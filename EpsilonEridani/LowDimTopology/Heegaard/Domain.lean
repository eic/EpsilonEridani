# Domains and periodic domains of a pointed Heegaard diagram

The attaching curves of a pointed Heegaard diagram `(Σ, α, β, z)` cut the surface into
*regions*, the closures of the components of `Σ - α - β`. A *domain* is an integral
combination of regions. This file records the incidence data that domains need, with no
surface in sight, and develops domains, periodic domains and weak admissibility on top of it.

`HeegaardRegionSystem` is abstract incidence data: `Region` is supplied by the caller.
Its local incidence conditions do not identify the connected components of the complement
of a specified surface diagram. To use these definitions for such a diagram, one must
separately show that its supplied labels are exactly those components; identifying two
components changes the incidence system and can change its periodic domains and
admissibility. All results below concern the supplied incidence system.

The data extends `EpsilonEridani.HeegaardIntersectionSystem`, which labels each intersection point by
its `α`- and `β`-curve. Orient every attaching curve. The intersection points on the `α`-curve
`α_i` cut it into arcs, one starting at each point `p` on `α_i` and ending at the next point
along `α_i`, `alphaNext p`; when that curve has intersection points, they form a single cycle of
`alphaNext`. Empty curve fibres satisfy the cycle condition vacuously. Each such
arc has a region on its left and one on its right. The `β`-curves are recorded in the same way,
with compatible region labels at each crossing and every region incident to an arc unless there
are no intersection arcs. Each basepoint lies in a region. A generator supplies an intersection
point on every curve, so curves in a diagram with a generator are subdivided into arcs.

In these terms the `α`-part of the boundary of a domain `D` is the `1`-chain on `α`-arcs whose
coefficient on the arc starting at `p` is `D (alphaLeft p) - D (alphaRight p)`, and the boundary
of the arc starting at `p` is `alphaNext p - p`. A domain `D` *connects* a generator `x` to a
generator `y` when `∂(∂D ∩ α) = y - x` and `∂(∂D ∩ β) = x - y`; the domain of every Whitney
disk from `x` to `y` connects `x` to `y` in this sense. A domain is *periodic* when it has
multiplicity zero at every basepoint and its boundary is a sum of whole `α`- and `β`-curves. The
periodic domains form a subgroup, and the domains connecting `x` to `y` with prescribed basepoint
multiplicities form a coset of it. A diagram is *weakly admissible* when every nonzero periodic
domain has both positive and negative coefficients: the finiteness hypothesis under which the
differential of `HF̂` is a finite count.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.HeegaardRegionSystem`: intersection data together with the cyclic order of the
  intersection points along each curve, the regions on the two sides of each arc, and the
  regions containing the basepoints.
* `EpsilonEridani.HeegaardRegionSystem.alphaBoundary`, `EpsilonEridani.HeegaardRegionSystem.betaBoundary`: the
  `α`- and `β`-parts of the boundary of a domain.
* `EpsilonEridani.HeegaardRegionSystem.alphaArcBoundary`, `EpsilonEridani.HeegaardRegionSystem.betaArcBoundary`:
  the boundary of a `1`-chain on the `α`- or `β`-arcs.
* `EpsilonEridani.HeegaardRegionSystem.IsDomainBetween`: `D` is a domain connecting `x` to `y`.
* `EpsilonEridani.HeegaardRegionSystem.periodicDomains`: the subgroup of periodic domains.
* `EpsilonEridani.HeegaardRegionSystem.WeaklyAdmissible`: every nonzero periodic domain has both
  positive and negative coefficients.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.HeegaardRegionSystem.boundary_boundary_eq_zero`: the full boundary of every region
  chain is a cycle.
* `EpsilonEridani.HeegaardRegionSystem.alphaArcBoundary_eq_zero_iff`: a `1`-chain on the `α`-arcs is a
  cycle exactly when it is a combination of whole `α`-curves.
* `EpsilonEridani.HeegaardRegionSystem.mem_periodicDomains_iff_exists_curves`: a domain is periodic
  exactly when it avoids the basepoints and its boundary is a combination of whole curves.
* `EpsilonEridani.HeegaardRegionSystem.IsDomainBetween.add`: domains connecting `x` to `y` and `y` to
  `w` add to a domain connecting `x` to `w`.
* `EpsilonEridani.HeegaardRegionSystem.IsDomainBetween.sub_mem_periodicDomains_iff`: the domains
  connecting `x` to `y` with the basepoint multiplicities of a given one form a coset of the
  periodic domains.
* `EpsilonEridani.HeegaardRegionSystem.weaklyAdmissible_iff`: weak admissibility says that the only
  nonnegative periodic domain is zero.

/-- The incidence data of a pointed Heegaard diagram needed for domains. On top of the
intersection data it records, for each intersection point `p`, the next intersection point along
the oriented `α`- and `β`-curve through `p`, the regions to the left and to the right of the arcs
starting at `p`, and the region containing each basepoint. The points on each curve form a single
cycle of the corresponding successor permutation when nonempty. Region labels agree around each
crossing. Each region is incident to an arc, apart from the one-region case with no arcs. The data
does not assert that the labels are the connected complementary regions of a particular surface
realization; that requires a separate identification. -/
