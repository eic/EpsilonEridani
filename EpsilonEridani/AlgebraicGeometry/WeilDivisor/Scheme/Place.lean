# Orders of vanishing at codimension-one points as orders at places

Let `X` be a locally Noetherian integral scheme over a field `k` and let `x` be a codimension-one
point whose local ring is a discrete valuation ring. This file identifies the order at the place
`Scheme.toPlace` attached to `x` with the scheme-theoretic order of vanishing at `x`, both as a
function on rational functions and as an additive homomorphism on `Additive X.functionFieldˣ`.

This is the local bridge used to transport divisor and differential constructions between
scheme-theoretic codimension-one points and abstract function-field places.

## Main results

* `CodimensionOnePoint.toPlace_ord`: the order at the place is the scheme-theoretic order of
  vanishing.
* `CodimensionOnePoint.toPlace_ordAddMonoidHom`: the corresponding additive order homomorphisms
  agree.
