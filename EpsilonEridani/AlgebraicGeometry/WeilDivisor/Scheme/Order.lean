# Orders of rational functions at codimension-one points

For a locally Noetherian integral scheme `X`, Mathlib defines the order of vanishing
`Scheme.ord f x : ℤ` of a rational function at a point. This file packages its restriction to
nonzero rational functions at a codimension-one point as an additive homomorphism

`SchemeWeilDivisor.orderAt x : Additive X.functionFieldˣ →+ ℤ`.

This is the local algebraic input for the scheme-theoretic principal-divisor map. Constructing
that map also requires the separate global theorem that a nonzero rational function has nonzero
order at only finitely many codimension-one points; no finiteness assumption is hidden here.

Elementary facts about `Scheme.ord` itself are recorded first: the order of one vanishes
(`Scheme.ord_one`), the order of an inverse is the negative of the order (`Scheme.ord_inv`), and a
function regular on `U` has nonnegative order at every point of `U`
(`Scheme.ord_germToFunctionField_nonneg`), that is, it has no poles where it is defined.

Where the local ring at a codimension-one point is a discrete valuation ring, `orderAt` is
surjective onto `ℤ` (`SchemeWeilDivisor.exists_orderAt_eq`): the powers of a uniformizer supply
a rational function of each prescribed order.

The construction reuses Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.ord`, `ordHom`, and
`ord_eq_unzero_ordHom`; no external formalization is vendored.
