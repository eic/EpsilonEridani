# Relative degrees of scheme-theoretic Weil divisors

This file specializes `WeilDivisor.weightedDegree` to the residue-degree weights associated to a
scheme morphism. For a curve over a field, applied to its structure morphism, this is the divisor
degree `Σ_x [κ(x) : k] · ord_x`.

The composition formula records how these weights change through successive scheme morphisms.
This supplies the residue-field-weighted divisor degree required in Layer A of the Jacobian
challenge roadmap.
