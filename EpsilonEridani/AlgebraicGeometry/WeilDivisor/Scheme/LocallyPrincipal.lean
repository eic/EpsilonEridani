# Locally principal Weil divisors on a scheme

Let `X` be a locally Noetherian integral scheme. A Weil divisor `D` on `X` is locally principal when
every point has an open neighbourhood on which the coefficients of `D` agree with the orders of one
nonzero rational function. On a scheme regular in codimension one (expressed in
`EpsilonEridani/AlgebraicGeometry/WeilDivisor/Scheme/Sheaf.lean` by the codimension-one stalks being
discrete valuation rings), this is the local condition used to compare Weil divisors with the
Cartier divisors defined in `EpsilonEridani/AlgebraicGeometry/CartierDivisor/Basic.lean`.

The predicate and its additive subgroup require only `IsLocallyNoetherian X`. Results involving
the globally assembled principal Weil divisors and linear equivalence require `IsNoetherian X`,
which supplies the finite-support condition for `orderAt`. The local triviality of `𝒪_X(D)`
additionally requires the codimension-one stalks to be discrete valuation rings, which is the
hypothesis under which that sheaf is built.

## Main declarations

* `SchemeWeilDivisor.IsLocallyPrincipal D` is the local-principality predicate;
* `SchemeWeilDivisor.locallyPrincipalSubgroup X` is the subgroup of locally principal Weil
  divisors;
* `SchemeWeilDivisor.principalSubgroup_le_locallyPrincipalSubgroup` records that principal
  divisors are locally principal;
* `WeilDivisor.OrderSystem.LinearlyEquivalent.isLocallyPrincipal_iff` shows that local
  principality depends only on the divisor class;
* `SchemeWeilDivisor.IsLocallyPrincipal.exists_sections_sub_principalDivisor_eq_sections_zero`
  and `SchemeWeilDivisor.IsLocallyPrincipal.exists_iso_sheaf_sections_eq_sections_zero` consume
  the predicate: the sheaf `𝒪_X(D)` of
  `EpsilonEridani/AlgebraicGeometry/WeilDivisor/Scheme/Sheaf.lean` is isomorphic, near every point, to
  the sheaf of a divisor whose sections there are those of `𝒪_X(0)`;
* `SchemeWeilDivisor.isLocallyPrincipal_of_forall_isClosed_singleton` establishes the predicate
  whenever the codimension-one points of `X` are closed and their local rings are discrete
  valuation rings: then *every* Weil divisor is locally principal, equivalently
  `SchemeWeilDivisor.locallyPrincipalSubgroup_eq_top_of_forall_isClosed_singleton`;
* `SchemeWeilDivisor.isLocallyPrincipal_of_forall_coheight_le_one` and
  `SchemeWeilDivisor.locallyPrincipalSubgroup_eq_top` specialize this to a curve, where every
  point has codimension at most one and codimension-one points are therefore closed.

Existence of local equations is the first half of the local comparison of Weil and Cartier
divisors: near each point a divisor is the divisor of a nonzero rational function. The matching
uniqueness half — that such a function is determined up to a regular unit, so that its class in
`𝒦_X^× / 𝒪_X^×` is well defined — is in
`EpsilonEridani/AlgebraicGeometry/WeilDivisor/Scheme/Cartier/Basic.lean`.

In higher dimension the same conclusion needs the local rings of `X` to be unique factorization
domains rather than merely one-dimensional; without such a hypothesis a Weil divisor need not be
locally principal, and it is that failure which separates the divisor class group of `X` from its
Picard group.

The local-equation formulation follows Hartshorne, *Algebraic Geometry*, II.6. The Stacks
Project, *Divisors*, Tags 0BE0 and 0BE9, supplies the principal-Weil-divisor and Picard/class-group
comparison context. No formalization is vendored. The proofs reuse Tau Ceti's scheme-theoretic
principal-divisor and linear-equivalence API.
