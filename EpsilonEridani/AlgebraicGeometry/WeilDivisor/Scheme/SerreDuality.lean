# Serre duality for divisor sheaves on a curve

Let `X` be an integral separated Noetherian curve over a field `k` whose codimension-one local
rings are discrete valuation rings and whose structure morphism satisfies the existence part of
the valuative criterion (a proper curve, for instance), so that its codimension-one points are the
places of the function field `k(X)`. The cohomology of the sheaves `𝒪_X(D)` is then identified
with the function-field objects of Weil's theory of repartitions and differentials, and this file
deduces, when `k` is integrally closed in `k(X)` (`IsIntegrallyClosedIn k X.functionField`),
**Serre duality** in the form

`H¹(X, 𝒪_X(D))^∨ ≃ H⁰(X, 𝒪_X(K - D))`,

for `K` a canonical divisor, that is, a divisor whose class in the function field is the
canonical class of Weil differentials.

The two halves are:

* `H⁰(X, 𝒪_X(D)) = L(D)` (`SchemeWeilDivisor.globalSectionsEquivRiemannRochSpace`): a global
  section of `𝒪_X(D)` is a rational function whose order at every codimension-one point `x` is at
  least `-D(x)`, which is exactly membership in the Riemann–Roch space of the corresponding
  function-field divisor;
* `H¹(X, 𝒪_X(D))^∨ = Ω(D)` (`SchemeWeilDivisor.cohomologyOneDualEquivWeilDifferentialFiltration`):
  first cohomology is the repartition quotient `A_{k(X)} / (A_{k(X)}(D) + k(X))`, and the Weil
  differentials bounded by `D` are by definition the linear forms on the repartitions that vanish
  on `A_{k(X)}(D) + k(X)`.

Combined with the function-field duality `L(W - D) ≃ Ω(D)`, `x ↦ x · ω`, for `W` the divisor of a
nonzero Weil differential `ω`, this is Serre duality. The pairing is explicit: a section `f` of
`𝒪_X(K - D)` pairs with the class of a repartition `a` to `ω(f · a)`.

Under the same constant-field hypothesis, taking `D = 0` computes the genus:
`dim_k H¹(X, 𝒪_X)` is the genus of the function field, and a canonical divisor has degree
`2g - 2`.

## Main declarations

* `SchemeWeilDivisor.cohomologyOneDualEquivCohomologyZero`: **Serre duality**,
  `H¹(X, 𝒪_X(D))^∨ ≃ H⁰(X, 𝒪_X(K - D))`, with the pairing
  `SchemeWeilDivisor.cohomologyOneDualEquivCohomologyZero_symm_apply_repartitionToCohomologyOne`;
* `SchemeWeilDivisor.finrank_cohomology_one_sheaf_eq_finrank_cohomology_zero_sheaf_sub`:
  `dim_k H¹(X, 𝒪_X(D)) = dim_k H⁰(X, 𝒪_X(K - D))` for every canonical divisor `K`;
* `SchemeWeilDivisor.genus_eq_genus_functionField`: the genus `dim_k H¹(X, 𝒪_X)` of `X` is the
  genus of its function field;
* `SchemeWeilDivisor.relativeDegree_eq_two_mul_genus_sub_two`: a canonical divisor has degree
  `2g - 2`.

Let `ω` be a nonzero Weil differential of the function field and `K` the divisor on `X`
corresponding to its divisor `(ω)`. For every Weil divisor `D`, the dual of `H¹(X, 𝒪_X(D))` is
`H⁰(X, 𝒪_X(K - D))`; a section `f` pairs with the
