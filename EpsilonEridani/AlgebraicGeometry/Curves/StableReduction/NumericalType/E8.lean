# Exceptional `E₈` configurations of `(-2)`-indices

This file treats finite and affine `E₈` configurations of `(-2)`-indices occurring in the
classification of connected proper subgraphs of a numerical type. A chain of seven components
with an extra leaf at its fifth component is simply laced: all eight weights and all seven
displayed intersections agree, and there are no other edges. This is
[Stacks, Lemma 55.5.14](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C8L).

Extending the long arm by one component produces the affine `E₈` diagram. Its marks form a
positive kernel vector for the displayed intersection matrix. Negative definiteness on a proper
family of components therefore rules out this configuration, which is
[Stacks, Lemma 55.5.16](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C8P).

## Main results

* `IsSelfIntersectionMinusTwoChain.exists_weight_intersection_branch_eight_eq`: the finite `E₈`
  configuration is simply laced.
* `EpsilonEridani.NumericalType.IsSelfIntersectionMinusTwoChain.not_affineE8`: the affine `E₈`
  configuration cannot be a proper subgraph of `(-2)`-indices.

/-- A chain `c₀ - c₁ - ⋯ - c₆` of `(-2)`-indices, together with an eighth
`(-2)`-index meeting `c₄`, is simply laced. Thus all eight weights agree, every displayed
intersection is that common weight, and the eighth component meets no other component of the
chain. This gives the classification of the `E₈` configuration in
