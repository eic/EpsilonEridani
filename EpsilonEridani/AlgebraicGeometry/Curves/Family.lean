# Families of curves

A morphism of schemes `f : X ⟶ S` is a *family of curves* if it is proper, flat, of finite
presentation, and of relative dimension at most one, following the Stacks Project's notion of a
family of curves over a scheme base. Nodal, prestable, semistable, and stable families of curves
are families of curves satisfying further conditions. Geometric connectedness of the fibres and
the genus are deliberately not part of the definition.

Finite presentation is recorded as `LocallyOfFinitePresentation`: a proper morphism is already
quasi-compact and separated, hence quasi-separated.

The notion is invariant under isomorphisms, local on the target, and stable under arbitrary base
change. Over a field, it says that a proper scheme has dimension at most one. Finite flat
morphisms of finite presentation are families of curves.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.FamilyOfCurves f`: `f` is a family of curves.
* `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.FamilyOfCurves.isZariskiLocalAtTarget`: locality on the target.
* `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.FamilyOfCurves.of_isPullback`: stability under base change.
* `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.familyOfCurves_iff_of_field`: families of curves over a field.
