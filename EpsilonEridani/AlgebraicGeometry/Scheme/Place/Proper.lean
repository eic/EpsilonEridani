# Places have unique centers on proper curves

Let `X` be an integral scheme of dimension at most one over a field whose structure morphism
satisfies the existence part of the valuative criterion, a proper curve for instance. If the
local ring at every codimension-one point is a discrete valuation ring, then every normalized
place of the function field of `X` is attached to a codimension-one point; if `X` is moreover
separated, the codimension-one points are canonically equivalent to those places.

Existence is the valuative criterion, applied to the valuation ring of a place. The closed point
of the resulting lift cannot map to the generic point of `X`, since that would put the whole
function field in the valuation ring. The dimension bound therefore makes the image a
codimension-one point. Its local ring maps into the valuation ring, which identifies the
associated normalized place. Injectivity is `CodimensionOnePoint.toPlace_injective`, which rests
on the uniqueness part of the valuative criterion.

This equivalence permits divisor and principal-parts constructions indexed by codimension-one
points of a proper curve to be reindexed by function-field places.

## Main results

* `CodimensionOnePoint.toPlace_surjective`: every place of the function field of such a curve is
  attached to a codimension-one point;
* `CodimensionOnePoint.equivPlace`: the resulting equivalence between codimension-one points and
  places.
