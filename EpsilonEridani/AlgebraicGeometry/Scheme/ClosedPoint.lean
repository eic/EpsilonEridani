# Residue fields at closed points are finite over global functions

Let `f : X ⟶ Y` be a morphism locally of finite type to an affine Jacobson scheme, for instance a
scheme of finite type over a field. The residue field `κ(x)` at a closed point `x` of `X` is a
finite extension of the residue field of its image (Hilbert's Nullstellensatz), so evaluation
at `x` makes `κ(x)` a finite algebra over the global functions of `X`.

This is the finiteness that bounds the jump `dim H⁰(X, 𝒪_X(D + x)) - dim H⁰(X, 𝒪_X(D))` by the
degree of a closed point `x` of a curve.

## Main declarations

* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.finite_Γevaluation_of_isClosed`: the evaluation map
  `Γ(X, ⊤) ⟶ κ(x)` at a closed point is finite;
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.residueDegree_ne_zero_of_isClosed`: the residue degree
  `[κ(x) : κ(f x)]` at a closed point is finite, hence nonzero.

The input is Mathlib's `isFinite_iff_locallyOfFiniteType_of_jacobsonSpace` applied to
`Spec κ(x) ⟶ X ⟶ Y`, as in Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.residueFieldIsoBase`.
