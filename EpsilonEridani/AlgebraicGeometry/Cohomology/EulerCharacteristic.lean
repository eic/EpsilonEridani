# The Euler characteristic of a sheaf of modules on a scheme

For a scheme `X` over a field `k`, the cohomology `Hⁱ(X, M)` of a sheaf of modules is a
`k`-vector space, so the alternating sum of its dimensions can be formed. This file introduces
that alternating sum, truncated at a degree `n`, and proves that it is additive on short exact
sequences as soon as the truncation degree is one past the last nonvanishing degree.

## Main declarations

* `Scheme.Modules.eulerCharBelow k X M n`, the alternating sum
  `∑_{i < n} (-1)ⁱ dim_k Hⁱ(X, M)`. For a sheaf whose cohomology is finite-dimensional in
  degrees `< n` and vanishes in degrees `≥ n` this is the Euler characteristic `χ(X, M)`;
* `Scheme.Modules.eulerCharBelow_sub_sub`, the exact defect of additivity: the failure of
  `eulerCharBelow` to be additive on a short exact sequence `0 ⟶ M₁ ⟶ M₂ ⟶ M₃ ⟶ 0` is, up to
  sign, the dimension of the image of the last connecting map that the truncation cuts off;
* `Scheme.Modules.eulerCharBelow_eq_add_of_cohomologyδ_eq_zero`, the additivity itself,
  under the vanishing of the connecting map the truncation cuts off, and
  `Scheme.Modules.eulerCharBelow_eq_add`, the form in which that vanishing comes from the
  vanishing of `Hⁿ(X, M₁)`;
* `Scheme.Modules.finrank_cohomology_zero_sub_one_eq_add`, the shape of the additivity on a
  curve, where cohomology vanishes above degree one so that
  `χ(X, M) = dim H⁰(X, M) - dim H¹(X, M)`;
* `Scheme.Modules.eulerCharBelow_congr`, the invariance of the truncated Euler characteristic
  under isomorphism, and
  `Scheme.Modules.finrank_cohomology_zero_eq_finrank_globalSections`, the identification of
  `dim H⁰(X, M)` with the dimension of the space of global sections.

## Junk values

No finiteness assumption is built into `eulerCharBelow`, exactly as none is built into
Mathlib's `HomologicalComplex.eulerChar`: `Module.finrank` is `0` on an infinite-dimensional
space, so a degree `i < n` in which `Hⁱ(X, M)` is infinite-dimensional contributes `0` to the
sum instead of making it meaningless. The alternating sum is therefore read as an Euler
characteristic when the cohomology is finite-dimensional in the degrees `< n` it sums over:
accordingly the statements that read it that way, `eulerCharBelow_sub_sub`,
`eulerCharBelow_eq_add_of_cohomologyδ_eq_zero`, `eulerCharBelow_eq_add` and
`finrank_cohomology_zero_sub_one_eq_add`, assume that finite-dimensionality — but only where
the dimension count really needs it. For the middle term of the sequence that is the degrees
below the truncation; for the first term only the positive ones among them, since the
degree-zero contribution of `M₁` is computed by an injectivity; and for the third term nothing
at all, since exactness makes `Hⁱ(X, M₃)` finite-dimensional as soon as `Hⁱ(X, M₂)` and
`Hⁱ⁺¹(X, M₁)` are — only `eulerCharBelow_sub_sub`, whose defect term lives in the top degree
the truncation reads, still assumes it there. So the curve statement
`finrank_cohomology_zero_sub_one_eq_add` assumes finite-dimensionality of `Hⁱ(X, M₂)` in
degrees `0` and `1` and of `H¹(X, M₁)`, and of nothing else — while
`eulerCharBelow_zero`, `eulerCharBelow_succ`, `eulerCharBelow_two` and `eulerCharBelow_congr`
are identities of the alternating sum as it stands and need no such hypothesis.

The proof is the usual dimension count in the long exact cohomology sequence: the rank-nullity
theorem turns each of the three cohomology dimensions in degree `i` into a sum of two ranks of
maps of the sequence, and the alternating sum telescopes down to the single rank left over at
the truncation degree.

Additivity of the Euler characteristic is what makes the degree of a line bundle on a curve,
`deg L := χ(L) - χ(𝒪_X)`, behave additively, and it is the step from which Riemann-Roch is
proved by induction on a divisor. It is therefore Layer B infrastructure for
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/JacobianChallenge/README.md`, "genus, Riemann-Roch, Serre duality".

No formalization is vendored. The alternating-sum bookkeeping reuses Mathlib's
`LinearMap.finrank_range_add_finrank_ker`, `LinearMap.finrank_range_of_inj` and
`Function.Exact.linearMap_ker_eq`, and the finite-dimensionality that exactness supplies is
Mathlib's `Module.Finite.of_exact`; the long exact sequence and the linearity of its maps are
`EpsilonEridani/AlgebraicGeometry/Cohomology/LongExactSequence.lean`.

/-- The alternating sum `∑_{i < n} (-1)ⁱ dim_k Hⁱ(X, M)` of the dimensions of the cohomology of
a sheaf of modules on a scheme over a field, truncated at degree `n`.

No finiteness assumption is imposed, just as none is imposed on Mathlib's
`HomologicalComplex.eulerChar`: a degree `i < n` in which `Hⁱ(X, M)` is infinite-dimensional
contributes the junk value `finrank k Hⁱ(X, M) = 0`. For this sum to be the Euler
characteristic `χ(X, M)` it is enough that the cohomology be finite-dimensional in degrees
`< n` and vanish in degrees `≥ n`; that is a sufficient condition and not a necessary one,
since a truncation that cuts off finite-dimensional cohomology whose own alternating sum
vanishes computes `χ(X, M)` just as well. On a curve, the relevant truncation is `n = 2`. -/
