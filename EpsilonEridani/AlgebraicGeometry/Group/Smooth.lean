# Smoothness of group schemes over algebraically closed fields

A reduced group scheme locally of finite type over an algebraically closed field is smooth.
This upgrades a ring-theoretic reducedness hypothesis to geometric smoothness at the level of
group schemes, and supplies the scheme-theoretic input for coordinate-ring consequences such as
the finite-type commutative Hopf algebra smoothness criterion.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.smooth_of_grpObj_of_isAlgClosed_of_isReduced`: the
  reducedness criterion for smooth group schemes over algebraically closed fields.

## References
