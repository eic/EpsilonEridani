# The patch presentation of the valuation spectrum

Following Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1), proof of Proposition 4.7: the map
sending a point of `Spv A` to the boolean table of its relation embeds `Spv A` into the
compact product `(A × A) → Bool`, with closed image; the basic opens of `Spv A` are clopen
for the induced compact topology. This is the presentation that the patch criterion for
spectral spaces consumes to prove `Spv A` spectral.

It also settles quasi-compactness of the generating family of `Spv A`, by instantiating the patch
criterion's `isCompact_of_isClosed_generateFrom` at `patchTopology A`: the mechanism lives once,
in `EpsilonEridani/Topology/Spectral/PatchCriterion.lean`, and is specialised here. That is the part of
Wedhorn's Theorem 4.9 which says the family consists of quasi-compact opens, as opposed to merely
generating the topology. It says nothing about Lemma 7.5(1), whose family lives in `Spv (A, I)`:
these statements do not transfer to the traces along the inclusion. That side is proved separately
in `SpvOfIdeal/Spectral.lean`, by the same criterion applied to the witness topology coinduced
along `r_I`. Nor is the *basis* property proved here — only quasi-compactness of the individual
members.

The quasi-compactness of the basic opens also yields, by stability of pro-constructibility
under intersections, that the sub-unit locus `{v | ∀ a ∈ S, v(a) ≤ 1}` is pro-constructible in
`Spv A`. Like everything above this is a statement about `Spv A` itself, subject to the same
non-transfer caveat: the `Spv (A, IA)` analogue that Theorem 7.35 consumes is proved on that
side (`isProConstructible_val_preimage_setOfPred_forall_vle_one`), not by restriction.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.toPatch` : The relation table `Spv A → (A × A) → Bool`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.patchTopology` : The compact witness topology on `Spv A`
  induced from the product.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.isClosedEmbedding_toPatch` : The table is a closed embedding
  of the witness topology into the product.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.compactSpace_patchTopology` : The witness topology is compact.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.isClopen_patchTopology_basicOpen` : Basic opens are clopen for
  the witness topology.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.isCompact_of_isClosed_patchTopology` : a patch-closed subset is
  quasi-compact, with `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.isCompact_basicOpen` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.isCompact_basicOpenFinset` its two instances.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.isProConstructible_setOfPred_forall_vle_one` : the locus
  `v ≤ 1` on a set of ring elements is pro-constructible **in `Spv A`** — the `Spv A`-level
  shape of the sub-unit condition of `Spa (A, A⁺)`; the `Spv (A, IA)` statement that Wedhorn's
  Theorem 7.35 consumes is `isProConstructible_val_preimage_setOfPred_forall_vle_one`
  (`SpvOfIdeal/Spectral.lean`), proved there since the inclusion is not spectral.

## Provenance

The corresponding development in AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0) at commit
`2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08`, project `projects/AdicSpaces/`, reaches spectrality
through `isSpectralSpace_of_qcKolmogorov_oc_basis` and `Spv.isSpectralSpace`, which return a
`CompactSpace ∧ T0Space ∧ QuasiSober` conjunction; it has no counterpart to an isolated
quasi-compactness statement about a single rational subset. Nothing was copied.
