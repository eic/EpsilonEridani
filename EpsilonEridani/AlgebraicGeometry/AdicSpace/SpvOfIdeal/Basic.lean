# The subspace `Spv (A, I)` of the valuation spectrum

**Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1), §7.1.1.** For an ideal `I` satisfying the
standing hypothesis of §7.1 — that `I` has the same radical as some finitely generated ideal —
Wedhorn carves out of the valuation spectrum the set

```text
Spv (A, I) = { v ∈ Spv A : cΓ_v(I) = Γ_v }
```

of points whose ideal-indexed characteristic subgroup is everything.

Points of `Spv A` are *classes* of valuations, so a condition on valuations cuts out a subset
only if it is class-invariant. That is Lemma 7.4's role, recorded as
`Valuation.characteristicSubgroupOfIdeal_eq_top_congr_of_isEquiv`. No quotient
eliminator is needed: `ValuationSpectrum.valuation` picks a canonical representative of each
point and `ofValuation_valuation` says the choice round-trips, so the set is defined directly
by that representative and `mem_spvOfIdeal_ofValuation` transfers the test to any other.

## Relation to the AINTLIB formalisation

The AINTLIB adic-spaces development (`aintlib-adic-spaces`, revision `37bbdaeb9`,
`projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/SpvAI.lean`) already formalises this space, as
`Spv.IsInSpvAI`, but by the *other* clause of Lemma 7.4:

```text
(∀ a ∈ I, Valuation.CofinalValue v a) ∨ Valuation.IsMicrobial v
```

Taking clause (ii) as the definition sidesteps `cΓ_v(I)` entirely, so that development needs
neither Lemma 7.2 nor Definition 7.3. This file instead takes clause (i), `cΓ_v(I) = Γ_v`, as
Wedhorn does in §7.1.1, and recovers the disjunctive form as a theorem:
`mem_spvOfIdeal_iff_forall_cofinalValue_or_characteristicSubgroup_eq_top`
is essentially AINTLIB's definition, proved rather than assumed. The two routes agree by
Lemma 7.4.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.spvOfIdeal` : the subset `Spv (A, I)` of `Spv A`.

## Main results

* `mem_spvOfIdeal_iff_forall_cofinalValue_or_characteristicSubgroup_eq_top` : **Lemma 7.4**
  at the `Spv` level — the criterion in the form a consumer can actually check.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.mem_spvOfIdeal_iff` : membership unfolded through the canonical
  valuation, and `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.mem_spvOfIdeal_ofValuation` : membership tested on
  an arbitrary representative, which is what makes the definition usable.

ideal-indexed characteristic subgroup `cΓ_v(I)` is the whole value group. The hypothesis `hfg`
is Wedhorn's standing assumption for §7.1, that `I` shares a radical with a finitely generated
ideal; it is what makes `cΓ_v(I)` well posed. -/
