# Presentations are cofinal among rational subsets

Wedhorn defines the structure presheaf on `Spa(A,A⁺)` at an open `V` as the limit of the
coordinate rings of the rational subsets contained in `V`. The existing construction
`EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.presentationLimit` instead indexes the limit by admissible
*presentations* `(T,s)` of those subsets. This file supplies the categorical comparison of the
two indices needed once the coordinate rings are assembled into a diagram on rational subsets.

`RationalSubsetIndex Aplus V` is the partial order of rational subsets contained in `V`, ordered by
reverse inclusion, so a morphism points in the direction of restriction. The functor
`presentationToRationalSubsetIndex` forgets a presentation and remembers its subset. Every
rational subset has a presentation in this functor's image: openness of its numerator ideal gives
the standing denominator-power condition by
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.hasDenominatorPower_of_isOpen_span`.

The forgetful functor is both final and initial. Finality records the usual meaning of cofinality
for a basis ordered by refinement. Initiality is the form needed for limits: the costructured
arrow category over a rational subset is connected because two presentations containing it have
a common refinement which still contains it. Consequently, once a compatible coordinate-ring
diagram on rational subsets is constructed, its limit can be computed over presentations without
choosing a preferred presentation.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.RationalSubsetIndex`: rational subsets contained in an open, ordered
  by reverse inclusion.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.presentationToRationalSubsetIndex`: the functor forgetting
  presentation data.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.exists_presentationToRationalSubsetIndex_obj_eq`: every rational
  subset index is exactly represented by an admissible presentation.
* `CategoryTheory.Functor.Final
    (EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.presentationToRationalSubsetIndex Aplus V)`: presentations are
  cofinal among rational subsets.
* `CategoryTheory.Functor.Initial
    (EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.presentationToRationalSubsetIndex Aplus V)`: the cofinality
  condition that will preserve the rational-subset-indexed limit once its diagram is constructed.
