# The closed polydisc and its classical points

The *closed polydisc* of dimension `k` over a nonarchimedean ring `A` is the adic spectrum
`Spa (A⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩, A⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩°)` of the restricted power series ring with its power-bounded
subring as plus ring. For a complete nonarchimedean field this is the closed unit polydisc of rigid
geometry, the affinoid whose points Wedhorn classifies in Example 7.57; the rings of Definition
7.56 are its quotients.

Its first points are the *classical* ones, the "end points" of Wedhorn's picture. A point `x` of
`Spa (A, A°)` and a tuple `a ∈ (A°)ᵏ` give the point `f ↦ x (f (a))`: evaluation at `a` is a
continuous ring homomorphism `A⟨T⟩ → A` (Wedhorn, Proposition 5.50), it carries `A⟨T⟩°` into `A°`
because it retracts the continuous constant embedding `weightedC` — continuous ring homomorphisms
do not preserve power-boundedness in general — and the point is the pullback of `x` along it. When
`x` has trivial support, for instance whenever `A` is a field, distinct tuples give distinct
points.

The evaluation is taken along the identity of `A`, so `A` carries the hypotheses under which
Wedhorn's evaluation converges: complete, Hausdorff, and nonarchimedean as a uniform additive
group. For the polydisc itself, a nonarchimedean ring topology suffices.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.closedPolydisc`: the closed polydisc `Spa (A⟨T⟩, A⟨T⟩°)`, with
  `mem_closedPolydisc_iff` as its membership rule.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.evalAtHom`: evaluation of restricted power series at `a ∈ (A°)ᵏ`, as a
  ring homomorphism `A⟨T⟩ →+* A`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.classicalPoint`: the classical point of the closed polydisc attached
  to a point of `Spa (A, A°)` and a tuple `a ∈ (A°)ᵏ`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.continuous_evalAtHom` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.evalAtHom_mem_powerBoundedSubring`: evaluation at `a` is a morphism
  of Huber pairs `(A⟨T⟩, A⟨T⟩°) → (A, A°)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.classicalPoint_vle`: the classical point compares `f` and `g` as `x`
  compares `f (a)` and `g (a)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.classicalPoint_injective`: when `x` has trivial support, the
  classical points are parametrised faithfully by `(A°)ᵏ`;
  `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.classicalPoint_injective_of_isField` is the case of a field.

/-- **The closed polydisc of dimension `k` over `A`**: the adic spectrum of the restricted power

/-- The set-level characterization of the closed polydisc. `closedPolydisc` is not `@[expose]`d,
so its body is invisible across the module boundary and this equation is how consumers apply
set-level results to it — the same role `spa_def` plays for `spa`, which is likewise unexposed. -/

/-- Membership in the closed polydisc: a point of `Spv (A⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩)` lies on the polydisc
exactly when it is continuous and sub-unit on the power-bounded elements. This is `mem_spa_iff`
specialized to the polydisc, and is the elimination rule consumers use on a point of it. -/
