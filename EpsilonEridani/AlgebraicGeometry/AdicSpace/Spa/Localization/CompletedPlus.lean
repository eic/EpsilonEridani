# `A_U⁺` is the sub-unit locus of the rational subset

For a rational subset `U = R(T/s)` of `X = Spa (A, A⁺)`, the coordinate ring of `U` is
`A_U = A⟨T/s⟩` and its plus ring is `A_U⁺ = completedPlusSubring`. This file identifies `A_U⁺`
with the locus of `A_U` on which every point of `U` is sub-unit:

```text
A_U⁺ = { g ∈ A⟨T/s⟩ : v_x(g) ≤ 1 for every x ∈ R(T/s) }.
```

A point of `U` is read as a point of `Spa (A_U, A_U⁺)` through
`spaCompletedLocalizationHomeomorph`, which is what makes the right-hand side a condition indexed
by `U` rather than by the adic spectrum of `A_U`. This is the value of Wedhorn's `𝒪_X⁺` on the
basis of rational subsets, the second component of his Proposition 8.16.

The two sides meet at that homeomorphism. Proposition 7.52 (1), available as
`EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.mem_iff_forall_vle_one`, describes `A_U⁺` as the sub-unit locus of
`Spa (A_U, A_U⁺)`; transporting the quantifier along the homeomorphism replaces the adic spectrum
of `A_U` by `U`.

## What the plus ring has to satisfy

Proposition 7.52 (1) asks two things of `A_U⁺`: that it be open and that it be integrally closed
in `A⟨T/s⟩`, supplied by `EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.isOpen_completedPlusSubring` and
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.isIntegrallyClosedIn_completedPlusSubring`, each asking only that
`A⁺` contain the image of the ideal of definition — which the hypothesis `A₀ ≤ A⁺` carried by
`spaCompletedLocalizationHomeomorph` already gives. As in
`Spa/Localization/CompletedHomeomorph.lean` and `Spa/Localization/CompletedRationalSubset.lean`,
no completeness, Tate or Noetherian hypothesis enters and `A⁺` is otherwise an arbitrary subring.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.mem_completedPlusSubring_iff_forall_mem_rationalSubset_vle_one`:
  membership in `A_U⁺` is sub-unitness at every point of `R(T/s)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.coe_completedPlusSubring_eq_setOf_forall_mem_rationalSubset_vle_one`:
  the same statement as the displayed set equality.

/-- **`A_U⁺` is the sub-unit locus of `U`** — the value of Wedhorn's `𝒪_X⁺` on a rational subset,
which is the second component of his Proposition 8.16. An element of `A⟨T/s⟩` lies in `A_U⁺`
exactly when its value is at most `1` at every point of `R(T/s)`, each point being read as a point
of `Spa (A⟨T/s⟩, A_U⁺)` through `spaCompletedLocalizationHomeomorph`. -/
