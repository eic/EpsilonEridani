# Rational subsets descend along dense maps of Huber rings

**A generalization of the rational half of Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1),
Proposition 7.48.** Wedhorn states that for an affinoid ring `A` the canonical map
`Spa Â → Spa A` is a homeomorphism which maps rational subsets to rational subsets. This file
proves the **preimage** direction, and the inducing property it gives, for an arbitrary continuous
ring homomorphism `φ : A → B` with dense image between Huber rings: every rational subset of
`Spa(B, B⁺)` is the preimage under `spaComap φ` of a rational subset of `Spa(A, A⁺)`. Wedhorn's
image statement additionally needs `spaComap φ` to be surjective, which is not proved here.
Neither ring is assumed complete, and the plus rings `A⁺ ⊆ A` and `B⁺ ⊆ B` are arbitrary subrings
with `φ(A⁺) ⊆ B⁺`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.exists_mem_spaRationalFamily_spaComap_preimage_eq_of_denseRange`: every
  member of the rational family of `Spa(B, B⁺)` is the preimage under `spaComap φ` of a member of
  the rational family of `Spa(A, A⁺)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.isInducing_spaComap_of_denseRange`: `spaComap φ` is inducing.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.Pair.Hom.exists_mem_spaRationalFamily_spaComap_preimage_eq_of_denseRange` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Huber.Pair.Hom.isInducing_spaComap_of_denseRange`: the same two results for a morphism
  of Huber pairs whose underlying ring homomorphism has dense range.

## Provenance

**Adapted from AINTLIB, not ported** (C. Birkbeck; `github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0,
branch `dev/adic-spaces`, commit `37bbdaeb9ad9e3bc9f0d660feadc2779e455a91c`,
`projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/`). AINTLIB proves the corresponding descent only for the
canonical map from a complete Tate ring to a completed rational localisation of it, as part of its
Wedhorn 8.2(2) comparison. The correspondence is:

* `SpaRationalSubsetCorrespondence.lean`, `exists_downstairs_rationalDatum` — AINTLIB's form of
  `exists_mem_spaRationalFamily_spaComap_preimage_eq_of_denseRange`;
* `SpaParameterPerturbation.lean`, `exists_uniform_spanning_bound` and
  `indexedRationalSet_perturb_eq` — its padding and perturbation steps, which correspond to
  `EpsilonEridani.Huber.exists_isOpen_span_forall_sub_mem_of_denseRange` and
  `exists_finset_subset_isOpen_span` in `EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/Huber/OpenIdeal.lean`;
* `SpaRationalOpenHomeomorph.lean`, `exists_A_level_open_presentation` and
  `spaPresheafValueEquivRationalOpen_isOpenMap` — its open-presentation and open-map steps.

What changed: the rings are Huber rather than Tate and neither is complete; the map is any
continuous ring homomorphism with dense range rather than the canonical map to a completed
rational localisation; the plus rings are arbitrary subrings where AINTLIB requires rings of
integral elements; numerator ideals are only open where AINTLIB asks for the unit ideal; the
descended numerators are enlarged by a finite set generating an open ideal of `A` where AINTLIB
pads by a power of a topologically nilpotent unit; and the perturbation step is EpsilonEridani's
Huber-ring form of Proposition 7.34. No code is copied.

/-- **Rational subsets descend along a dense map (a generalization of the rational half of
Wedhorn Proposition 7.48).** If `φ : A → B` is a continuous homomorphism of Huber rings with dense
image, every member `R(T/s)` of the rational family of `Spa(B, B⁺)` is the preimage under
`spaComap φ` of a member `R(T'/s')` of the rational family of `Spa(A, A⁺)`; that is,
`R(T/s) = R(φ(T')/φ(s'))` with `T' · A` open.

As the rational family is a basis of `Spa(B, B⁺)`, this makes `spaComap φ` inducing
(`isInducing_spaComap_of_denseRange`). -/

/-- **Pullback of adic spectra along a continuous homomorphism of Huber rings with dense image is
inducing.** For the completion `A → Â` this is the inducing part of Wedhorn Proposition 7.48; here
neither ring needs to be complete, and `A⁺`, `B⁺` are arbitrary subrings with `φ(A⁺) ⊆ B⁺`.

Since `spa Bplus` is T0, `Topology.IsInducing.isEmbedding` upgrades this to an embedding. Unlike
`isEmbedding_spaComap`, this assumes no embedding of the full valuation spectra along `comap φ`. -/
