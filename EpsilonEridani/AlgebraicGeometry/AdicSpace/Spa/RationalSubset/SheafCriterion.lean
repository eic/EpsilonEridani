# Sheaves on `Spa(A,A⁺)` are detected on rational covers

Rational subsets form a basis of `Spa(A,A⁺)` (`isTopologicalBasis_spaRationalFamily`), and a
presheaf on a space is a sheaf exactly when it is a sheaf for covers by basis elements
(`isSheaf_iff_isSheafFor_basisCoverage_comp`). Putting the two together, sheafhood on the adic
spectrum is decided by the rational covers alone.

This is the fourth bullet of roadmap Layer 3.5, instantiated at the basis the roadmap names. It is
stated for an arbitrary presheaf, so it does not mention the structure presheaf; applying it to
`𝒪_X` is what turns the definition of sheafiness into Wedhorn's rational-cover condition.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.isSheaf_iff_isSheafFor_rationalCover` : the criterion.

The rational basis itself, in the `Opens` form this consumes, is
`EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.isBasis_spaRationalOpens` in
`EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.AdicSpace.Spa.RationalSubset.Basis`.

/-- **Sheafhood on `Spa(A,A⁺)` is decided by rational covers.** A presheaf valued in any category
is a sheaf for the topology of the adic spectrum exactly when it satisfies the sheaf condition for
every cover of an open by rational subsets.

Nothing here is specific to the structure presheaf: the statement quantifies over presheaves, and
`𝒪_X` is one instance. -/
