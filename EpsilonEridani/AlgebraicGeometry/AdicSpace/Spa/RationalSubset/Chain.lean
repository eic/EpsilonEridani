# Wedhorn's chain of rational subsets

**Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1), Remark 7.55.**

Wedhorn refines a rational subset `U = R(T/s)` into a descending chain of rational subsets

```text
Spa (A, A⁺) ⊇ X₀ ⊇ X₁ ⊇ ⋯ ⊇ Xₙ = U
```

in which every step adjoins a single numerator: `X₀ = R({u}/s)` for an element `u` dominated by
`s` throughout `U`, and `Xᵢ` adjoins the `i`-th element of `T`. The point of the
chain is that each of its steps is an elementary one, so a statement about restriction maps
between rational localisations that is stable under composition need only be proved for a single
adjoined numerator; this is how Wedhorn's Proposition 8.30 reduces flatness to an elementary case.

## The dominating element

Wedhorn obtains `u` from quasi-compactness of `U` via his Corollary 7.32, which produces a *unit*
`u ∈ Aˣ` with `|u(x)| < |s(x)| on U`, and writes the first link as
`X₀ = {x ∈ Spa A; 1 ≤ x(s/u)}`. That description presupposes `u` invertible, in order to form the
fraction `s/u`. Here `u : A` is an arbitrary ring element and `X₀` is the rational subset
`R({u}/s)`, which is the same set whenever `u` is a unit: `R({u}/s)` asks for `v(u) ≤ v(s)` together
with `v(s) ≠ 0`, and for a unit the second condition follows from the first, since `v(u) ≠ 0`.
Nothing in the chain needs invertibility, so it is not assumed; a caller holding Corollary 7.32's
unit `ϖ` applies these results with `u := (ϖ : A)`.

Strictness is likewise not needed. Wedhorn's `u` satisfies `v(u) < v(s)` on `U`, but the chain
only ever consumes the non-strict `v(u) ≤ v(s)`, so that is what the results below assume; a
caller holding the strict form passes `(hu v hv).vle`.

Quasi-compactness of `U` is likewise not a hypothesis here. It is the input to Corollary 7.32, and
enters only when a caller discharges the domination hypothesis by that route.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.exists_rationalSubset_chain` : Remark 7.55 itself — the descending
  chain of rational subsets from `R({u}/s)` down to `R(T/s)`, each step adjoining one element
  of `T`.

/-- **Wedhorn Remark 7.55: the chain of rational subsets.** Let `u` be dominated by `s`
throughout `U = R(T/s)`. Then there is a descending chain of rational subsets

```text
Spa (A, A⁺) ⊇ R({u}/s) = X₀ ⊇ X₁ ⊇ ⋯ ⊇ X_{#T} = U
```

whose every step adjoins a single element of `T` to the numerators.

The chain is exhibited by its numerator sets `N i`, each `Xᵢ` being `R(N i / s)`, so that every
member is a rational subset by construction rather than by a separate argument. The enumeration of
`T` is `Finset.toList`; any enumeration would do, and the statement fixes one only so that the
`i`-th step has a name. -/
