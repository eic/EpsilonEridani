# Continuous valuations extend to the completion

Let `A` be a commutative topological ring with a compatible uniform structure, and let `ι : A → Â`
be its Hausdorff completion. Every continuous point of `Spv A` is the pullback along `ι` of a
continuous point of `Spv Â`, and consequently pullback along `ι` maps `Spa (Â, Â⁺)` onto
`Spa (A, A⁺)`, where `Â⁺` is the closure of `ι(A⁺)`.

This is the surjectivity half of Wedhorn's Proposition 7.48, for an arbitrary subring `A⁺` of an
arbitrary commutative topological ring `A` with a compatible uniform structure: no Huber,
Hausdorff or completeness hypothesis is needed, and `A⁺` need not be a ring of integral elements.
For an affinoid ring, `closure (ι A⁺)` is Wedhorn's `Â⁺` (Lemma 7.47). Together with the
corresponding statement for rational subsets, this surjectivity feeds the identification of the
adic spectrum of a completed rational localisation with the rational subset it comes from; that
identification is a homeomorphism only once the map is also shown to be inducing and injective,
the latter through the T0 separation of the adic spectrum.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.exists_isContinuous_comap_coeRingHom_eq` : a continuous point of
  `Spv A` is the pullback of a continuous point of `Spv Â`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.spaComap_coeRingHom_surjective` : pullback along `A → Â` maps
  `Spa (Â, closure (ι A⁺))` onto `Spa (A, A⁺)`.

## Provenance

AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0), branch `dev/adic-spaces` at commit
`37bbdaeb9ad9e3bc9f0d660feadc2779e455a91c`, file
`projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/SpaRationalOpenComparison.lean`, was consulted: its `scResHom`,
`scResHom_val`, `scResHom_continuous`, `comap_coeRingHom_extensionHom_ofValuation_eq` and
`spa_completion_of_spa_localization` extend a point along the completion of a rational
localisation through the completed residue field. Nothing was copied. Here the ring is an
arbitrary commutative uniform topological ring rather than a rational localisation, continuity is
the attained-value predicate of `Valuation.IsContinuous`, and the plus ring of the completion is
the closure of the image of `A⁺`.
