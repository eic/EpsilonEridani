# Points of the adic spectrum with prescribed support

Wedhorn Proposition 7.51, for open prime ideals: an open prime ideal `𝔭` of `A` is the support
of a point of `Spa(A, A⁺)`, namely the point of its trivial valuation, `trivialSection ⟨𝔭, ‹_›⟩`
(Wedhorn, Remark 4.6) — it is continuous because the only value sets to check are `∅` and `𝔭`,
and sub-unit on every subring because the trivial valuation never exceeds `1`. Proposition
7.52(2) follows: an element of `A` on which no point of `Spa(A, A⁺)` vanishes is a unit, because
a non-unit lies in some maximal ideal, and openness of maximal ideals makes that ideal a support.

Openness of maximal ideals enters only as a hypothesis; for complete linearly topologized rings
it is supplied by `Ideal.isOpen_of_isMaximal_of_isOpen_isTopologicallyNilpotent`
(`EpsilonEridani.Topology.Algebra.Nonarchimedean.MaximalIdeals`).

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.exists_mem_spa_supp_eq` : Proposition 7.51 — an open prime ideal
  is the support of a point of the adic spectrum.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.isUnit_of_forall_not_vle_zero` : Proposition 7.52(2) — if no point
  of `Spa(A, A⁺)` vanishes on `f`, then `f` is a unit.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.span_eq_top_of_forall_mem_spa_exists_not_vle_zero` : the converse
  half of Corollary 7.53 — if every point of `Spa(A, A⁺)` is nonzero somewhere on `T`, then `T`
  generates the unit ideal.

## Provenance

Adapted from AINTLIB (see References), section `Prop752` of the source file: the derivation of
7.52(2) is that file's, with the valuation-spectrum vocabulary adapted to this repository's
`Spv`/`ValuativeRel` interface (`trivialSection`, `mem_spa_iff`, `supp`) and the statement of 7.51
weakened from maximal to prime ideals. The trivial-valuation witness is also that file's, but it no
longer lives here: it was factored out as `trivialSection_mem_spa_iff` in
`EpsilonEridani/AlgebraicGeometry/AdicSpace/Spa/Basic.lean`, which carries the credit for it.

/-- **Proposition 7.51**, for open prime ideals: an open prime ideal `𝔭` is the support of a
point of the adic spectrum — the point of its trivial valuation, `trivialSection ⟨𝔭, ‹_›⟩`.
Wedhorn states the proposition for maximal ideals; the proof needs only primality. -/

/-- **The converse half of Wedhorn Corollary 7.53.** If every maximal ideal of `A` is open and
every point of `Spa(A, A⁺)` is nonzero on some member of `T`, then `T` generates the unit ideal.

Wedhorn states this for a complete affinoid ring, where every maximal ideal is automatically
open; the openness hypothesis is what replaces completeness here, matching the generality the
forward half already has in
`EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.mem_rationalSubset_of_span_eq_top_of_mem_spa`. `T` is an arbitrary
set: finiteness plays no part, and enters only in the rational-cover corollary. -/

  obtain ⟨t, ht, hvt⟩ := h v hv
  exact hvt ((mem_supp_iff v t).mp (hle (Ideal.subset_span ht)))

/-- **Proposition 7.52(2)**: if every maximal ideal of `A` is open and no point of
`Spa(A, A⁺)` vanishes on `f`, then `f` is a unit.

Wedhorn states this for a complete affinoid ring; as with the converse above, openness of the
maximal ideals is what replaces completeness.

⚠ That replacement is not innocent: `hmax` is unsatisfiable over a nonzero Tate ring, so this
statement and the converse above are vacuous on the affinoid rings Wedhorn applies them to. In a
Tate ring an ideal is open exactly when it is `⊤`, so no proper ideal is open; see
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsTateRing.not_isOpen_of_isMaximal`, and its consequence
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsTateRing.subsingleton_of_forall_isMaximal_isOpen`. A form usable for Tate rings
has to reach the point of Proposition 7.51 without going through an open maximal ideal —
`mem_of_forall_vle_one`, which is 7.52(1), avoids the problem entirely. -/
