# The restriction underlying the retraction `r_I`

**Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1), §7.1.2.**

A point of `Spv A` is sent to the class of its canonical valuation restricted to `cΓ_v(I)`. The
restriction itself, together with its interface, lives in
`EpsilonEridani.RingTheory.Valuation.CofinalIdeal.Restrict`; this file only carries it to the level of
points.

Wedhorn's retraction has two properties beyond being this map: it **lands in** `Spv (A, I)`, and
it **fixes** that subspace pointwise. **Both are proved here**, so the map is also offered with
the codomain the roadmap asks for — `restrictToIdealCodRestrict` — and that form is a retraction
in the literal sense, `restrictToIdealCodRestrict_coe` saying it moves no point of the subspace.
The declarations keep the name `restrictToIdeal` rather than `retract` because that is what they
compute; the retraction property is the content of the two theorems, not of the name.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.restrictToIdeal` : the restriction, at the level of points of
  `Spv A`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.restrictToIdealCodRestrict` : the same map with the roadmap's
  codomain, `Spv A → Spv (A, I)`, obtained by corestricting along the landing theorem below. This
  is the canonical form for a consumer, who then holds a point of the subspace rather than a
  point of `Spv A` together with a membership proof.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.restrictToIdeal_def` : the point map, unfolded through the
  canonical valuation.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.vle_restrictToIdeal` : the valuative relation of the restricted
  point, in terms of the original one.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.restrictToIdeal_mem_spvOfIdeal` : the restriction lands in
  `Spv (A, I)`. The mathematics is valuation-level and proved there, as
  `Valuation.characteristicSubgroupOfIdeal_restrictToIdeal_eq_top`; this only adds that
  membership may be tested on the canonical valuation of the point.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.coe_restrictToIdealCodRestrict` : the corestriction read back in
  `Spv A`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.restrictToIdeal_eq_self_of_mem_spvOfIdeal` : the restriction fixes
  `Spv (A, I)` pointwise — a point of the subspace has `cΓ_v(I) = ⊤`, so nothing is discarded.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.restrictToIdealCodRestrict_coe` : the retraction law itself, that
  `r_I` composed with the inclusion of the subspace is the identity.

/-- **The point map, unfolded through the canonical valuation.** Consumers rewrite through this
to reach the valuation-level restriction rather than unfolding the definition, whose body is not
exposed. Note this is the definitional unfolding at `v.valuation`, not a formula valid at an
arbitrary representative of the class. -/

/-- **The valuative relation of the restricted point.** Comparison is the whole observable
content of a point of `Spv A`, so this is the interface to `restrictToIdeal` at the level of
points: `a ≤ b` after restriction exactly when `a`'s value is discarded, or `b`'s is kept and
`a ≤ b` held already. The side conditions are discharged by
`Valuation.restrictToIdeal_eq_zero_iff`. -/

condition cutting out the subspace.

The mathematics is valuation-level and lives there, as
`Valuation.characteristicSubgroupOfIdeal_restrictToIdeal_eq_top`; all this adds is that
membership of a point may be tested on its canonical valuation. -/

/-- **The roadmap's `r_I : Spv A → Spv (A, I)`**, with the codomain the roadmap asks for. This is
`restrictToIdeal` corestricted along the landing theorem, so a consumer receives a point of the
subspace rather than an `Spv A`-point plus a membership proof to carry around. It is a genuine
retraction: `restrictToIdealCodRestrict_coe` below says it fixes the subspace pointwise. -/
