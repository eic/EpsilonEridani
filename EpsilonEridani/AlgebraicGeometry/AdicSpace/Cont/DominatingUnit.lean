# Wedhorn Lemma 7.31 and Corollary 7.32: dominating a nonvanishing element by a unit

Let `A` be a Tate ring, `X` a quasi-compact set of continuous points of `Spv A`, and `f : A` an
element that vanishes at no point of `X`. Wedhorn Corollary 7.32 produces a **unit** of `A` whose
valuation is everywhere on `X` strictly below that of `f`; Lemma 7.31 is the neighbourhood-of-zero
form it is drawn from.

## The cover both rest on

Fix a topologically nilpotent `t : A`. A continuous point `v` with `v f ≠ 0` opens the ball
`{a | v a < v f}` around `0`, so the powers of `t` eventually enter it — that is
`Valuation.exists_pow_lt_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent`, and it places `v` in the basic open set
`Spv(A)(tⁿ/f)` for some `n`. These basic opens increase in `n` on `X`, because `v t < 1` there,
so quasi-compactness collapses the cover to a single exponent: `X ⊆ Spv(A)(tᵐ/f)`.

Lemma 7.31 spends that exponent at a pseudouniformiser `ϖ`. The set `ϖᵐ · I` is then a
neighbourhood of zero — multiplication by the unit `ϖᵐ` is an open map, and the image of an ideal
of definition is an open neighbourhood of zero — and every `a = ϖᵐ y` in it satisfies
`v a = v ϖᵐ · v y < v ϖᵐ ≤ v f`, strictly because `y` is topologically nilpotent. Corollary 7.32
then reads off a unit inside that neighbourhood, which is what the Tate hypothesis is for.

## The hypothesis is continuity, not the plus ring

Wedhorn states both results for a quasi-compact subset of an adic spectrum `Spa (A, A⁺)`. Neither
proof uses the sub-unit condition on `A⁺`, only continuity of the points, so both are stated here
over `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.cont A`. They apply verbatim in Wedhorn's setting through
`spa_def ▸ Set.inter_subset_left : spa Aplus ⊆ cont A`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.exists_subset_basicOpen_pow`: the collapsed cover — some power of a
  topologically nilpotent element is dominated by `f` throughout `X`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.exists_mem_nhds_zero_forall_vlt`: **Lemma 7.31** — a neighbourhood of
  zero all of whose elements are strictly dominated by `f` throughout `X`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.exists_unit_forall_vlt`: **Corollary 7.32** — a unit strictly
  dominated by `f` throughout `X`.

The Tate-ring input, that a neighbourhood of zero contains a unit, is
`EpsilonEridani.HasZeroSequenceOfUnits.exists_unit_smul_mem` at `x = 1`, available for a Tate ring
through the instance `EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsTateRing.hasZeroSequenceOfUnits`.

## Provenance

Adapted from AINTLIB (see References), file `Cor732.lean`: the cover-and-collapse argument, the
construction of the neighbourhood as `ϖᵐ · I`, and the assembly of the corollary are that file's
`exists_pow_dominated_finset`, `exists_zero_nbhd_lt_on_qc` and `exists_dominating_unit_noHArch`.
The vocabulary is adapted to this repository's interfaces throughout: `cont`/`Spv.valuation` in
place of that file's `Spa`/`ValuativeRel.valuation` pairing, `basicOpen` in place of its bespoke
`dominatedBy`, and the per-point step delegated to
`Valuation.exists_pow_lt_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent` rather than restated. That file's
`exists_dominating_unit`, which assumes `MulArchimedean` value groups, is *not* Corollary 7.32 and
is not ported; the route taken here is Wedhorn's own and carries no such hypothesis.

/-- **The cover behind Wedhorn Lemma 7.31, collapsed to one exponent.** For `X` a quasi-compact
set of continuous points at which `f` does not vanish and `t` topologically nilpotent, some power
`tᵐ` is dominated by `f` at every point of `X`: `X ⊆ Spv(A)(tᵐ/f)`.

Pointwise this is `Valuation.exists_pow_lt_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent` at the threshold `v f`,
whose ball is open because `v` is continuous. The resulting basic opens increase in the exponent
on `X`, so a finite subcover has a largest exponent that works for all. -/
