# Continuous points in `Spv (A, I)`: Wedhorn's Theorem 7.10 and Corollary 7.12

**Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1), Theorem 7.10 and Corollary 7.12.**

Theorem 7.10 identifies `Cont A` inside `Spv (A, IA)` for a pair of definition `(A₀, I)`, as the
locus where additionally `v(a) < 1` for every `a ∈ I`. This file proves the two conjuncts of the
inclusion — a continuous point lies in `Spv (A, IA)`, and it is sub-unit on the ideal of
definition — then the converse, and assembles the identification
`cont_eq_spvOfIdeal_inter_setOfPred_forall_vlt_one`. Corollary 7.12 follows: the sub-unit
condition is closed in `Spv A`, so `Cont A` is a closed subset of the subspace `Spv (A, IA)`.

For the inclusion, the argument needs no estimate and no pair of definition either. Membership in
`Spv (A, I)` is `cΓ_v(I) = Γ_v`, which by Lemma 7.4 follows from cofinality of `v` at every
element of a *spanning set*; and continuity turns topological nilpotence into cofinality. So the
hypothesis that carries the proof is exactly "spanned by topologically nilpotent elements", which
is what `mem_spvOfIdeal_of_span_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent_of_isContinuous` below assumes — and
of an ideal with the same radical as `I`, since `cΓ_v(I)` sees `I` only through its radical. The
extended ideal of a pair of definition is the case at hand, since the image of `I` spans `IA` and
its elements are topologically nilpotent.

Passing through a spanning set is essential, not a convenience. A general element of `IA` is a sum
`Σ xᵢ aᵢ` with `xᵢ ∈ I` and `aᵢ ∈ A` arbitrary, and such a sum need not be topologically
nilpotent — the nilpotence is a property of the generators, not of the ideal they generate.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.mem_spvOfIdeal_of_span_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent_of_isContinuous`
  : a continuous point lies in `Spv (A, I)` whenever some ideal with the same radical as `I` is
  spanned by topologically nilpotent elements.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.mem_spvOfIdeal_extendedIdealOfDefinition_of_isContinuous` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.cont_subset_spvOfIdeal_extendedIdealOfDefinition` : its reading at a
  pair of definition, in membership and subset form.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.not_vle_one_of_isContinuous_of_mem_idealOfDefinition` : the other
  conjunct of the inclusion `⊆` — a continuous point is sub-unit on the ideal of definition.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.isContinuous_of_mem_spvOfIdeal_of_forall_vlt_one` : the converse.
  Lemma 7.4 reads membership as cofinality on `IA` or a full characteristic group, and either
  branch feeds the cofinality engine
  `EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.isContinuous_of_forall_cofinalValue`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.cont_eq_spvOfIdeal_inter_setOfPred_forall_vlt_one` : **Theorem 7.10**,
  the resulting identification of `Cont A` inside `Spv (A, IA)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.isClosed_val_preimage_cont` : **Corollary 7.12**, `Cont A` is a
  closed subset of `Spv (A, IA)`.

/-- **A continuous point lies in `Spv (A, I)` when some ideal with the same radical is spanned by
topologically nilpotent elements.** This is the membership conjunct of the inclusion half of
Wedhorn Theorem 7.10: continuity makes the value at a topologically nilpotent element cofinal,
and Lemma 7.4 only ever asks for cofinality on a spanning set.

`cΓ_v(I)` depends on `I` only through its radical, so the spanning set need not generate `I`
itself — any `J` with `I.radical = J.radical` will do. The spanning set is not assumed finite and
no pair of definition appears; both enter only in the specialisation below. -/

The sub-unit hypothesis quantifies over the ideal of definition `I` itself — through the
subring inclusion — and not over the extension `IA`. The `IA`-form would be the stronger
demand (the extension contains the image of `I` among much else), and it is not what Theorem
7.10's right-hand side supplies. -/
