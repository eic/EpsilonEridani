# `Cont A` is a spectral space: the second half of Wedhorn's Corollary 7.12

**Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1), Corollary 7.12.**

The continuous points of the valuation spectrum of a Huber ring form a spectral space. Wedhorn
draws this as a corollary of Theorem 7.10: `Cont A` is closed in `Spv (A, IA)`, and a closed
subspace of a spectral space is spectral.

The closedness half is `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.isClosed_val_preimage_cont`; this file draws
the conclusion. A closed subset is in particular pro-constructible, hence spectral in the
spectral space `Spv (A, IA)`, so
`EpsilonEridani.spectralSpace_of_isEmbedding` carries it back along the subtype embedding, using the
Theorem 7.10 inclusion `Cont A ⊆ Spv (A, IA)`.

The argument is run on the subspace and transported back along a homeomorphism rather than
carried out in `Spv A`, because the inclusion `Spv (A, IA) → Spv A` is not a spectral map
(Remark 7.6) and the general preservation theorems are therefore unavailable along it.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.spectralSpace_cont_of_pairOfDefinition` : `Cont A` is a spectral
  space, from an explicit pair of definition.
* The `SpectralSpace (cont A)` instance for a Huber ring, which names no pair.

/-- **Wedhorn Corollary 7.12**: over a Huber ring the continuous points form a spectral space —
by instance synthesis, with the pair of definition chosen from
`IsHuberRing.nonempty_pairOfDefinition`, so that the statement mentions no pair. That the space
does not depend on the pair is already true by construction: `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.cont` is
defined from the topology of `A` alone. -/
