# Points of the valuation spectrum of a directed union of images

Let `R` be a commutative ring and `fᵢ : Bᵢ → R` a family of ring homomorphisms whose images form
a directed family of subrings covering `R`, as for the canonical maps into a filtered colimit of
rings. A family of points `wᵢ ∈ Spv Bᵢ` that is compatible in the sense that

```text
fᵢ a = fⱼ a',  fᵢ b = fⱼ b',  a ≤_{wᵢ} b   ⟹   a' ≤_{wⱼ} b'
```

glues to a unique point `w ∈ Spv R` whose pullback along each `fᵢ` is `wᵢ`: to compare two
elements of `R`, lift both to a common `Bᵢ` and compare the lifts with `wᵢ`.

This is how a valuation on a stalk is assembled from valuations on the rings of sections over
the neighbourhoods of a point.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.ofDirected`: the glued point of `Spv R`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.vle_ofDirected_iff`: two elements lifted to a common `Bᵢ` compare as
  their lifts do for `wᵢ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.comap_ofDirected`: the glued point pulls back to `wᵢ` along `fᵢ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ValuationSpectrum.eq_ofDirected`: it is the only point of `Spv R` with this property.
