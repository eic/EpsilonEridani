# The factorisation of an isogeny

The pointedness criterion in `Isogeny/InfinityPlace.lean` discharges the pointedness of a factor.
If two isogenies `φ : W₁ → W₂` and
`ψ : W₁ → W₃` satisfy `ψ^*F(W₃) ⊆ φ^*F(W₂)` as subfields of `F(W₁)`, then inverting `φ^*` on its
image gives an embedding `σ : F(W₃) → F(W₂)` with `φ^* ∘ σ = ψ^*`. Restricting the place at
infinity of `W₁` along `φ^*` and `ψ^*` gives the places at infinity of `W₂` and `W₃`, so
restricting along `σ` carries the one to the other; the criterion then makes `σ` an isogeny
`λ : W₂ → W₃`, and `λ ∘ φ = ψ`. Uniqueness is `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.comp_right_injective`, and the
degree formula `deg ψ = deg λ · deg φ` is the tower formula `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.degree_comp`.

The criterion is stated on subfields, not on kernels: over `ℚ` a curve with no rational
`2`-torsion has `ker [2](ℚ) = ker (id)(ℚ) = {O}` while `id` does not factor through `[2]`, and
relative Frobenius has trivial geometric point kernel while `id` does not factor through it. Both
are correctly excluded here, the subfield containment failing in each case.

When `#ker φ = deg φ`, however, `ker φ` cuts out `φ^*F(W₂)`: the kernel test `ker φ ≤ ker ψ`
is then equivalent to the subfield criterion. In this development `Isogeny.ker` consists of
base-field points, and the cardinality condition is equivalent to the relevant fixed-field
equality (`EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.card_ker_eq_degree_iff`). Over a separably closed field it is the
condition a separable isogeny is expected to satisfy.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.existsUnique_comp_eq_iff_fieldRange_le`: **the factorisation theorem**, that
  `ψ` factors through `φ` by a unique isogeny exactly when `ψ^*F(W₃) ⊆ φ^*F(W₂)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.existsUnique_comp_eq_iff_ker_le`: when `#ker φ = deg φ`, the same
  criterion can equivalently be stated as `ker φ ≤ ker ψ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.exists_comp_eq_id_and_comp_eq_id_of_degree_eq_one`: **a degree-one isogeny is
  an isomorphism**, the first consequence of the factorisation theorem.

## Roadmap

`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, **Layer 1**, "The factorisation theorem — made a
milestone in its own right, because it is what the dual is built from": for isogenies
`φ : W₁ → W₂` and `ψ : W₁ → W₃`, `ψ` factors as `ψ = λ ∘ φ` for a unique isogeny `λ` iff
`ψ^*K(W₃) ⊆ φ^*K(W₂)` as subfields of `K(W₁)`, with `deg ψ = deg φ · deg λ`. The same layer's
dual-isogeny bullet asks for the route taken here — "an **unpointed induced-place map** for
finite function-field embeddings, with the named criterion `MapsInfinity λ ↔ λ_*(O₂) = O₃`
(equivalently its valuation/integral-closure form), and functoriality of induced places along
`λ ∘ φ = ψ`".

## Provenance

Not ported. Silverman's III.4.11 is stated for separable isogenies and proved by Galois theory of
the function-field extension; the subfield criterion here subsumes it and needs no separability,
and the pointedness of the factor — which the classical account does not have to address, its
morphisms being maps of projective curves — is discharged by the place criterion above. The
kernel form uses the translation-action correspondence of
`Affine/FunctionField/Translation/FixedField.lean` for the same Galois theory.

/-- **The factorisation theorem** (Silverman, *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*, III.4.11 in its
separable form): an isogeny `ψ : W₁ → W₃` factors through an isogeny `φ : W₁ → W₂`, by a unique
isogeny `λ : W₂ → W₃`, exactly when the function field `ψ` pulls back sits inside the one `φ`
pulls back.

The criterion is on subfields of `F(W₁)`, not on kernels of point maps, and that is what makes it
correct in general: over `ℚ`, a curve with no rational `2`-torsion has `ker [2](ℚ) = {O}` without
the identity factoring through `[2]`, and relative Frobenius has trivial *geometric* point kernel
without the identity factoring through it. In both cases the subfield containment fails, as it
should. -/

/-- **The kernel form of the factorisation theorem** (Silverman III.4.11). When the kernel of
`φ : W₁ → W₂` has `deg φ` points, an isogeny `ψ : W₁ → W₃` factors through `φ`, by a unique
isogeny, exactly when `ker φ ≤ ker ψ`.

Without the hypothesis only the forward implication holds (`EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.ker_le_ker_comp`).
The subfield criterion `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.existsUnique_comp_eq_iff_fieldRange_le` needs no
hypothesis. -/
