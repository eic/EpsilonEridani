# The intermediate ring is a Dedekind domain

For an isogeny `φ : Isogeny W₁ W₂`, the intermediate ring — the integral closure of
`W₂.CoordinateRing` in `W₁.FunctionField` — is a Dedekind domain whenever the target's coordinate
ring is one. Nothing is assumed about the function-field extension beyond what the isogeny already
gives, so **inseparable isogenies are covered, Frobenius included**.

This is what the relative ideal norm asks of the *middle* ring: `ClassGroup.relNorm`, and through
it `ClassGroup.extendedRelNormHom`, is stated over a module-finite extension of Dedekind domains,
so `Isogeny.pushClass` needs `φ.intermediateRing` to be Dedekind and not merely normal.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.isDedekindDomain_intermediateRing`: `φ.intermediateRing` is a Dedekind domain.

## Design

**Why this is separate from `IntegrallyClosed.lean`.**
`Isogeny.isIntegrallyClosed_intermediateRing` is proved from the formal fact that integrality is
transitive, and sees neither a trace form nor a finiteness hypothesis. Being *Dedekind* is a
conjunction — integrally closed, Noetherian, dimension at most one — and the Noetherian half is
where the cost enters: it needs the extension `W₂.FunctionField ≤ W₁.FunctionField` to be finite,
which is why this file takes the algebra structures and the tower that name that extension while
its sibling takes only the isogeny.

**Where the separability hypothesis went.** Until `EpsilonEridani.IsIntegralClosure.isDedekindDomain`
existed, the Noetherian half could only be had from Mathlib's
`IsIntegralClosure.isDedekindDomain`, whose route is the trace pairing and which therefore sits
under the section variable `[Algebra.IsSeparable K L]` at
`Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/IntegralClosure.lean` line 147. This file carried that
hypothesis for exactly that reason, and its own docstring recorded that the conclusion was
expected to hold without it. Krull–Akizuki
(`EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/IntegralClosure/NormalizationFinite.lean`) removed the obstruction, and
`EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/IntegralClosure.lean` assembles the Dedekind conclusion from it,
so the hypothesis is now gone from the statement.

**The sibling `Finite.lean` drops it too.** `Isogeny.moduleFinite_intermediateRing` concludes that
`φ.intermediateRing` is a finite `W₂.CoordinateRing`-module by the general separability-free
finite-normalization theorem for a polynomial ring over a field. Krull–Akizuki alone would not
supply that stronger module-finiteness conclusion.

`IsDedekindDomain W₂.CoordinateRing` is taken as a hypothesis rather than derived. It is supplied
in two steps: `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isDedekindDomain_coordinateRing_of_isIntegrallyClosed`
needs `[IsIntegrallyClosed W₂.CoordinateRing]`, and for an elliptic curve
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isIntegrallyClosed_coordinateRing` supplies that from `[W₂.IsElliptic]`.
Taking the Dedekind property directly keeps both steps out of this file and states exactly what
the conclusion needs.

## Provenance

⚠ *mathlib-track*. `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:1092` lists the `IntermediateRing`
with `intermediateRingFinite` and `intermediateRingIsIntegrallyClosed` among the components of
D. Angdinata's shared isogeny development, on the way to `pushClass` and `toPointHom`; the Dedekind
property is what those two facts are combined for. The same target records at `:1097` that the
hypothesis inventory of that development is "genuinely minimal", which is what dropping
separability here restores.

AINTLIB proves the same statement about the same object as
`NormConormIntegralClosure.instDedekindB` (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0,
`HasseWeil/Curves/NormConormIntegralClosure.lean`, by Chris Birkbeck), for
`B := integralClosure C₂.CoordinateRing C₁.FunctionField`, but only in the separable case and by
the Mathlib route this file no longer uses. What is adapted here is the reduction to
`intermediateRing` as this repository defines it — through the corestricted pullback and
`Isogeny.isIntegralClosure_intermediateRing` — rather than to Mathlib's literal `integralClosure`
subalgebra.

/-- **The intermediate ring is a Dedekind domain.** It is the integral closure of
`W₂.CoordinateRing` in `W₁.FunctionField`, and the integral closure of a Dedekind domain in a
finite extension of its fraction field is again Dedekind.

No separability of the function-field extension is assumed — the Noetherian half comes from
Krull–Akizuki through `EpsilonEridani.IsIntegralClosure.isDedekindDomain` — so this covers inseparable
isogenies, Frobenius included, exactly as `Isogeny.isIntegrallyClosed_intermediateRing` does. -/
