# The intermediate ring of an isogeny has rank the degree, and its fibres count it

The intermediate ring of an isogeny `φ : W₁ → W₂` — the integral closure of `W₂.CoordinateRing`
inside `W₁.FunctionField` — is a `W₂.CoordinateRing`-module of rank exactly `φ.degree`. This is the
arithmetic content of the roadmap's *place-free* count: the degree, defined as a dimension of
function fields, is also a rank over the coordinate ring, so for a maximal prime it can be read off
the primes of the intermediate ring lying over that prime instead of off a field extension.

The bridge is a localization comparison. `W₂.FunctionField` is the fraction field of
`W₂.CoordinateRing` by definition, and `W₁.FunctionField` is the fraction field of the intermediate
ring — the intermediate ring is an integral closure inside a finite extension of the fraction field
below, and such a closure always has the ambient field as its fraction field. `Module.finrank` is
insensitive to passing to fraction rings on both sides (`IsFractionRing.finrank_eq`), so the rank
downstairs equals the degree upstairs.

Once the extension is finite and flat the rank turns into a fibre count. Over a Dedekind coordinate
ring its torsion-freeness supplies flatness, so Mathlib's fundamental identity
`Ideal.sum_ramification_inertia_eq_finrank` applies verbatim: for a prime `p` of
`W₂.CoordinateRing`, the primes of the intermediate ring lying over `p`, weighted by ramification
index times inertia degree, total `φ.degree`. When `p` is maximal (equivalently, nonzero in the
Dedekind case), this is the fibre of the intermediate ring over the affine point named by `p`;
dropping the weights bounds the number of its primes by the degree.

Everything here counts *primes*, not points. The primes of the intermediate ring over `p` are the
points of `W₁` above the affine point that `p` names only when `W₁` is nonsingular, so that the
integral closure is the ring of functions on `W₁` itself rather than on its normalization. No
statement below assumes that, and none of them is stated in terms of points.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.isFractionRing_intermediateRing`: `W₁.FunctionField` is the fraction field of
  the intermediate ring.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.finrank_intermediateRing_eq_degree`: the intermediate ring has rank `φ.degree`
  over `W₂.CoordinateRing`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.moduleProjective_intermediateRing`: it is projective, hence locally free, over a
  Dedekind `W₂.CoordinateRing` once it is module-finite.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.sum_ramificationIdx_mul_inertiaDeg_eq_degree`: the **fundamental identity** for
  an isogeny — `∑_{q ∣ p} e_q · f_q = deg φ` over every prime `p` of `W₂.CoordinateRing`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.ncard_primesOver_le_degree`: hence there are at most `deg φ` primes above `p`.

## Design

**The rank statement needs no separability, no Dedekind hypothesis and no ellipticity.**
`IsFractionRing.finrank_eq` identifies the two ranks with no finiteness input at all, so nothing
about the module structure of the intermediate ring has to be known in advance. What the proof
does spend is the finiteness of the *function-field* extension, which every isogeny has
(`Isogeny.finiteDimensional_functionField`) — purely inseparable ones, Frobenius among them,
included. So `finrank_intermediateRing_eq_degree` is
available exactly where `Isogeny.degree` is, and in particular independent of whichever
hypotheses a caller uses to obtain module-finiteness.

**Why not `IsIntegralClosure.rank`.** Mathlib states the same comparison for an integral closure,
but only over a *principal ideal* base (`Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/IntegralClosure.lean`),
a hypothesis unavailable from the current assumptions. The roadmap's intended identification of
the coordinate ring's class group with the point group is context for this limitation, not an
obstruction established here. `IsFractionRing.finrank_eq` compares the ranks with no hypothesis on
the base at all, so it is the route taken here.

**Module-finiteness is an instance argument of projectivity and the fibre statements, not a derived
fact.** The three statements below that do need it take
`[Module.Finite W₂.CoordinateRing φ.intermediateRing]` rather than
`[Algebra.IsSeparable W₂.FunctionField W₁.FunctionField]` and a call to
`Isogeny.moduleFinite_intermediateRing`. Separability is not what these conclusions are about; it is
not needed by the general finite-normalization route in `IntermediateRing/Finite.lean`. Taking the
finiteness as a hypothesis rather than deriving it keeps these statements independent of how it
is obtained; a caller can supply it in one line from `moduleFinite_intermediateRing`.

**Flatness follows automatically in the Dedekind application.** The fundamental identity is
stated under its natural finite-flat hypotheses. Over a Dedekind domain a torsion-free module is
flat, and torsion-freeness of the intermediate ring is injectivity of `algebraMap W₂.CoordinateRing
φ.intermediateRing`, which follows from the hypotheses already present: the composite into
`W₁.FunctionField` is the pullback, and the pullback of an isogeny is injective. So
`moduleProjective_intermediateRing` supplies the flatness needed in the roadmap's Dedekind setting.
The argument is made once there rather than repeated: `IntermediateRing/Basic.lean` records that a
standalone torsion-freeness lemma about this ring was removed in review as a one-step wrapper, and
nothing here reinstates one.

**Why `isFractionRing_intermediateRing` is an instance while its neighbours are theorems.** Its
statement mentions only the canonical structures: the intermediate ring, its coercion into
`W₁.FunctionField`, and the subring's own algebra structure. There is no
`W₂.CoordinateRing`-algebra structure to choose, hence no diamond of the kind
`IntermediateRing/Basic.lean` avoids by keeping the pullback-induced structures local, and the
discrimination key `Isogeny.intermediateRing` confines instance search to the object it is about.
The sibling statements do name a chosen structure and therefore stay theorems with an explicit
hypothesis pinning it, as `Isogeny.moduleFinite_intermediateRing` does.

## Roadmap

`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, **Layer 1**, the "points come along" milestone, whose
place-free alternate route reads: "the intermediate ring is locally free of rank `deg φ` over the
Dedekind coordinate ring, so every fibre over an affine point has `deg φ` points with
multiplicity, and translation moves the kernel fibre onto one". This file is that rank and the
prime-level fibre count under it; reading those primes as the points the milestone speaks of needs
`W₁` nonsingular, which this file does not assume. It is also the form in which **Layer 0**'s
fundamental identity
`Σ_{w ∣ v} e_w · f_w = [F₁ : F₂]` reaches the affine places of `W₂`, the maximal ideals of its
coordinate ring.

## Provenance

The fraction-field statement is the content of `instFractionRingB` in the AINTLIB project
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, `dev/hasse-weil @ 513e83879e2f`, by Chris Birkbeck),
proved in `HasseWeil/Curves/RamificationFinite.lean` alongside the finiteness that
`IntermediateRing/Finite.lean` ports; `IntermediateRing/Basic.lean` records its port here. The proof
route — `IsIntegralClosure.isFractionRing_of_finite_extension` — is the source's. The source states
it for a fixed extension with the algebra structures supplied as instance arguments; here the
structures are the pullback-induced ones, installed inside the proof, so the statement is
hypothesis-free. The rank identity, projectivity, fundamental identity, and prime-count bound are
not in that source.

⚠ *mathlib-track*, with the sibling `Isogeny` files: `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`
pins D. Angdinata's shared isogeny development as carrying the intermediate ring and its
structural theory.

ring is the integral closure of `W₂.CoordinateRing` in `W₁.FunctionField`, and `W₁.FunctionField`
is a finite extension of `W₂.FunctionField` through the pullback, so the closure has the whole

No separability and no Dedekind hypothesis: the only input is finiteness of the function-field

/-- **The intermediate ring has rank the degree of the isogeny.** Both sides of
`W₂.CoordinateRing ⊆ φ.intermediateRing` become the corresponding function fields after passing to
fraction fields, and `Module.finrank` is unchanged by that passage, so the rank over the coordinate
ring is the degree of the extension of function fields — which is `Isogeny.degree`.

Stated for an arbitrary algebra structure whose coordinate-level structure map is the pullback,
matching `Isogeny.degree_eq_finrank` and `Isogeny.moduleFinite_intermediateRing`: registering such
a structure globally would be a diamond, since different isogenies induce different ones.

Nothing here is spent on separability or on the coordinate rings being Dedekind. -/

ring.** Once the function-field algebra structures and scalar towers required by
`finrank_intermediateRing_eq_degree` are also present, its rank is `φ.degree`. This is the form in
which the roadmap's place-free fibre count is stated.

The structure map is injective, because it factors the pullback of the isogeny and that is
injective, so the intermediate ring is torsion-free and hence flat over the Dedekind coordinate
ring; a finite module over a Noetherian ring is finitely presented, and a finitely presented flat
module is projective. -/

/-- **The fundamental identity for an isogeny** (Stichtenoth III.1.11): over a prime `p` of
`W₂.CoordinateRing`, the primes of the intermediate ring lying over `p`, each weighted by its
ramification index times its inertia degree, total `φ.degree`.

The sum is over primes and the statement stays there. For a nonsingular `W₁` and a maximal `p`
(equivalently, `p` nonzero when the coordinate ring is Dedekind) the intermediate ring is the ring
of functions on `W₁` regular away from `φ⁻¹(O₂)`, so its primes over `p` are the points of `W₁`
above the affine point of `W₂` that `p` names and the identity counts that fibre with multiplicity;
for a singular `W₁` the integral closure is a normalization instead, whose primes need not be points
of `W₁`. Neither hypothesis is taken here.

Module-finiteness is taken directly rather than derived inside this theorem;
`Isogeny.moduleFinite_intermediateRing` supplies it without separability. The `Fintype` binder is
what the sum ranges
over, so it belongs to the statement rather than to the proof: finiteness of the module gives
only `Finite` (`Algebra.QuasiFinite.finite_primesOver`), which no `∑ q : _` elaborates against.
Mathlib's `Ideal.sum_ramification_inertia_eq_finrank` takes the binder the same way, under the
same `Module.Finite`. -/

/-- **There are at most `deg φ` primes above `p`.** Dropping the weights from the fundamental
identity: every ramification index and every inertia degree is at least one, so the primes over
`p` number at most the degree. The count is `Set.ncard`, the spelling Mathlib's own cardinality
API for this set uses (`Ideal.ncard_primesOver_lt_of_not_le`). What is counted are primes of the
intermediate ring; reading them as the fibre over the affine place that `p` names needs `p` maximal
and `W₁` nonsingular, neither of which is assumed.

Equality holds exactly when every ramification index and every inertia degree over `p` is one.
Turning the weighted identity above into an honest count of geometric points is therefore Layer 1's
separable-⟹-unramified milestone (`e_q = 1`) together with a separably closed base (`f_q = 1`) and
a nonsingular `W₁`, which makes the primes counted here points of `W₁`; none of the three is
assumed. -/
