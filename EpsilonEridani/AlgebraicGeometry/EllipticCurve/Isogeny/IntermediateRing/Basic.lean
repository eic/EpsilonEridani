# The intermediate ring of an isogeny

The integral closure of the target coordinate ring inside the source function field, taken along
an isogeny's pullback. This is the normalization that `CoordinatePullback.MapsInfinity` names,
and it receives both coordinate rings: the target's through the pullback, and the source's
because `mapsInfinity` is precisely the assertion that it lands there.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.intermediateRing`: the integral closure of `W₂.CoordinateRing` in
  `W₁.FunctionField` along `φ.pullback`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.toIntermediateRing` and `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.pullbackToIntermediateRing`: the two
  coordinate rings corestricted into it, along which ideals are extended and the relative norm
  is taken.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.algebraMap_mem_intermediateRing`: the source coordinate ring lands in it.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.pullback_mem_intermediateRing`: so does the target coordinate ring.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.toIntermediateRing_injective` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.pullbackToIntermediateRing_injective`: both coordinate rings *embed* in it,
  through the corestricted `algebraMap` and the corestricted pullback respectively.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.isIntegralClosure_intermediateRing`: it really is the integral closure, in
  Mathlib's `IsIntegralClosure` sense.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.isScalarTower_intermediateRing`: the corestricted pullback puts it in a scalar
  tower under `W₂.CoordinateRing`, which is the other half of a consumer's setup.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.id_intermediateRing`: an identity isogeny's intermediate ring is the
  coordinate ring itself, sitting inside its own fraction field, and
  `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.id_pullbackToIntermediateRing`: its two corestrictions into that ring
  coincide.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.id_algebraMap_eq_pullback`: the identity isogeny's pullback is the coordinate
  ring's own embedding into its function field, in the form the consumers above take.

## Design

The result is a `Subring W₁.FunctionField`, not a `Subalgebra`. The algebra structure that
`φ.pullback` induces on `W₁.FunctionField` is deliberately not a global instance — different
isogenies induce different ones, so registering any would be a diamond, as `Isogeny/Basic.lean`
explains. A `Subalgebra` would put that structure into the *type*, forcing every statement about
the object to fix a choice of it; a `Subring` keeps it inside the definition, exactly where
`MapsInfinity` already keeps it.

The two corestrictions are plain `RingHom`s rather than an `Algebra W₂.CoordinateRing`
instance on the intermediate ring. An algebra *instance* would reintroduce the diamond the
`Subring` choice exists to avoid, since the structure it would register is the pullback-induced
one; a bundled map carries the same information to consumers without registering anything.

Nothing here assumes separability, so purely inseparable isogenies such as Frobenius are covered.
`id_intermediateRing` is stated for an integrally closed coordinate ring rather than an elliptic
one, which is all its proof uses; the elliptic case is that hypothesis discharged by
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isIntegrallyClosed_coordinateRing`, and is not given a separate name
because nothing would consume it.

The structural theory of this ring is not proved here. Module-finiteness over `W₂.CoordinateRing`
is in the sibling `IntermediateRing/Finite.lean` as `moduleFinite_intermediateRing`, with no
separability hypothesis; Dedekindness is in `IntermediateRing/Dedekind.lean` as
`isDedekindDomain_intermediateRing` and integral closedness in
`IntermediateRing/IntegrallyClosed.lean` as `isIntegrallyClosed_intermediateRing`. Its fraction
field, rank, projectivity, and prime-counting theory are in `IntermediateRing/Rank.lean`.

This opens the "points come along" milestone of Layer 1 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, which names this object as "the **intermediate ring**
— the integral closure of `W₂.CoordinateRing` in `W₁.FunctionField`, the normalization
`mapsInfinity` names", receiving both coordinate rings on the way to `pushClass` and
`toPointHom`. It follows Silverman, *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*, II.2.

## Provenance

⚠ *mathlib-track*. `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:1092` lists the `IntermediateRing`,
and `pushClass` by ideal extension and relative norm (`ClassGroup.extendedRelNormHom`), among the
components of D. Angdinata's shared isogeny development, on the way to `toPointHom`; the two
embeddings added here are what that relative-norm step requires of the intermediate ring, since
ideal extension along a non-injective map loses the information the class-group route needs. The
siblings `Finite.lean`, `Dedekind.lean`, `IntegrallyClosed.lean`, and `Rank.lean` carry the same
flag for the same object.

The choice of object is taken from the AINTLIB project (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, at
revision `2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08`, Apache 2.0 per the source file's header, by
Chris Birkbeck): `projects/HasseWeil/HasseWeil/Curves/NormConormIntegralClosure.lean`, which
introduces `B := integralClosure C₂.CoordinateRing C₁.FunctionField` and carries its structural
instances `instDedekindB`, `instModuleFiniteB`, `instFractionRingB` and `instTorsionFreeB`, proved
in `projects/HasseWeil/HasseWeil/Curves/RamificationFinite.lean`.

What is adapted here is the object and the observation that the integral closure over the
*coordinate* ring — rather than over a localization — is the right home for the norm and
class-group route to the induced map on points. Of the structural instances, module-finiteness and
Dedekindness are ported, in the siblings `IntermediateRing/Finite.lean` and
`IntermediateRing/Dedekind.lean` rather than here, both without separability: the former uses
separability-free finite normalization, and the latter uses
`EpsilonEridani.IsIntegralClosure.isDedekindDomain` in place of the Mathlib route the source uses.
`IntermediateRing/IntegrallyClosed.lean` proves integral closedness without it either.
`instFractionRingB` is ported in `IntermediateRing/Rank.lean` as
`isFractionRing_intermediateRing`, with the pullback-induced algebra structures installed locally
and no separability assumption. Only `instTorsionFreeB` is not ported. None of the declarations
below is a transcription of a source declaration.

**`instTorsionFreeB` is unported but not missing, and should stay unported.** Its content is
available from the two embeddings below composed with Mathlib's
`Module.isTorsionFree_iff_algebraMap_injective`: a consumer holding the corestricted algebra
structures writes

```
Module.isTorsionFree_iff_algebraMap_injective.mpr φ.toIntermediateRing_injective
Module.isTorsionFree_iff_algebraMap_injective.mpr φ.pullbackToIntermediateRing_injective
```

for the source and target sides. Named `isTorsionFree_intermediateRing` lemmas of exactly that shape
were written and then **deleted in review**, as one-step wrappers of that `iff` with no in-repo
consumer: a `theorem` carrying an explicit pointwise hypothesis can never be selected by instance
search, so it saves a caller nothing over the one-liner. Read "not ported" as "deliberately
absent, content reachable in one step" rather than as a gap to be filled.
