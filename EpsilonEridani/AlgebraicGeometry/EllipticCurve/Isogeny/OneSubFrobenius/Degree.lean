# The degree of `1 − π_q` is the number of rational points

Over a finite field the isogeny `1 − π_q` has degree the number of rational points of the curve.
One inequality is `pointCount_le_degree_oneSubFrobeniusIsogeny`: the kernel is every rational point
and the kernel is at most the degree. This file supplies the other.

An isogeny here has no map on points, so the count is made on embeddings of the function field.
Write `L` for the pulled-back field. Two embeddings of `K(W)` over `L` agree on `L`, so they move
the tautological point of `1 − π_q` to the same place; that image is the difference of the generic
point's image and its `q`-power image, so the two images of the generic point differ by a point
fixed by the `q`-power map, which therefore comes from the base field. An embedding is determined
by where it sends the generic point, so the resulting assignment of a rational point to an
embedding is injective. The separable degree is the number of such embeddings, and `1 − π_q` is
separable, so the degree is at most the point count.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.card_emb_oneSubFrobeniusIsogeny_le_pointCount`: the embeddings of `K(W)` over
  the pulled-back field are at most as many as the rational points.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.degree_oneSubFrobeniusIsogeny_le_pointCount`: hence `deg (1 − π_q)` is at most
  the point count.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.degree_oneSubFrobeniusIsogeny_eq_pointCount`: with the reverse bound,
  `deg (1 − π_q) = #E(𝔽_q)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.card_ker_oneSubFrobeniusIsogeny_eq_degree`: equivalently, the kernel of
  `1 − π_q` has `deg (1 − π_q)` points.

## Provenance

The route is that of the AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (Chris Birkbeck, Apache-2.0) at commit
`513e83879e2f8cbc626eb9e04d660e92be16ccba`, `HasseWeil/Isogeny/VerschiebungFactorization.lean`,
declaration `emb_le_card_kernel`, which assembles the same count at the point level. The proof
differs in what it rests on: there an isogeny carries its own map on points and the argument is
placed over `AlgebraicClosure K(E)` explicitly, while here the kernel is the translation-fixing
subgroup of the pulled-back field and the embeddings are Mathlib's `Field.Emb`, so the descent is
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.map_frobeniusAlgHom_eq_self_iff_mem_range_baseChange` and the
injectivity is `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.map_genericPoint_injective`.
