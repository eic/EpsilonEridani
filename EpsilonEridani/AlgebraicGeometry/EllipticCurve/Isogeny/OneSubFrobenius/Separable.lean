# The isogeny `1 − π` is separable

Over a finite field, the Frobenius isogeny `π` pulls the invariant differential `ω` back to `0`, so
the isogeny `1 − π` pulls it back to `ω` itself; by the differential criterion, `1 − π` is
separable (Silverman III.5.5). This is the step through which the number of rational points,
the size of the kernel of `1 − π`, becomes a degree.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.pullbackDifferential_oneSubFrobeniusIsogeny_invariantDifferential`:
  `(1 − π)^*ω = ω`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.isSeparable_oneSubFrobeniusIsogeny`: `1 − π` is separable.

## Provenance

The AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (Chris Birkbeck, Apache 2.0, commit
`513e83879e2f8cbc626eb9e04d660e92be16ccba`) also establishes the separability of `1 − π`, in
`AdditionPullback/Frobenius.lean`, for its own notion of isogeny, which carries a map on points.
Here the isogeny is a coordinate pullback and separability is that of the function-field
extension it induces, as everywhere in `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny`; nothing is taken from the source.
