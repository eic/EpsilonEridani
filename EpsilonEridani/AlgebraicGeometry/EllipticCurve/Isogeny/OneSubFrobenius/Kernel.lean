# Every rational point lies in the kernel of `1 − π`

Over a finite field the isogeny `1 − π_q` kills every `F`-rational point, so its kernel is all of
them. The reason is the one behind the classical count: `π_q` fixes the rational points, so
`(1 − π_q)(X + P) = (1 − π_q)(X)` for rational `P`, and a function pulled back along `1 − π_q` is
unmoved by translating by `P`.

An isogeny here has no point map, so the argument is carried out on tautological points. A kernel
element is a point whose translation fixes the pulled-back field; translation acts on a pullback by
post-composition, and a pullback is fixed by such an endomorphism exactly when its tautological
point is. The tautological point of `1 − π_q` is `g − π_q(g)`, and translation moves both terms by
the same rational point, so their difference does not move at all.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.ker_oneSubFrobeniusIsogeny`: the kernel of `1 − π_q` is everything.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.card_ker_oneSubFrobeniusIsogeny`: so its kernel has exactly as many elements
  as there are rational points.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.pointCount_le_degree_oneSubFrobeniusIsogeny`: consequently `deg (1 − π_q)`
  bounds `pointCount` above.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.pointCount_dvd_degree_oneSubFrobeniusIsogeny`: and, `1 − π_q` being
  separable, `pointCount` divides `deg (1 − π_q)`.

This is the lower half of `deg (1 − π_q) = #E(𝔽_q)`. The upper half asks in addition that the
kernel cut out the pulled-back field exactly, and is not proved here.

## References

* [J. Silverman, *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*][silverman2009], III.4, V.1.
* The AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (Chris Birkbeck, Apache 2.0, commit
  `513e83879e2f8cbc626eb9e04d660e92be16ccba`) states the two headline results in
  `Hasse/PointFix.lean` as `kernel_eq_top_of_hom_eq_id_sub_frobenius` and
  `card_kernel_eq_pointCount_of_kernel_eq_top`. Its isogenies carry a point map independent of the
  function-field pullback, and its Frobenius declares that map to be the identity, so there the
  first reduces to `sub_self`. The kernel here is defined from the pullback, so the proof is the
  tautological-point argument above instead.
