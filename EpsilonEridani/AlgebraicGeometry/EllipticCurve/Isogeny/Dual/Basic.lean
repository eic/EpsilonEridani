# Factoring multiplication through an isogeny whose kernel counts its degree

The kernel form of the factorisation theorem
`EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.existsUnique_comp_eq_iff_ker_le` applies to `[n]` with `n = deg φ`: every point
of `ker φ` is killed by the order of `ker φ`, which is `n`, so `[n]` factors through `φ`, uniquely.
The factor
`χ : W₂ → W₁` with `χ ∘ φ = [deg φ]` is the dual of `φ` (Silverman III.6.1), and its degree is
`deg φ`, by the tower formula and `deg [n] = n²`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.existsUnique_comp_eq_mulByIntIsogenyOfNeZero_degree`: when `#ker φ = deg φ`,
  there is a unique `χ` with `χ ∘ φ = [deg φ]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.degree_eq_of_comp_eq_mulByIntIsogenyOfNeZero_degree`: any such `χ` has degree
  `deg φ`.

## Provenance

Not ported. The factorisation of `[deg φ]` and the degree of its factor are the opening
construction of the dual isogeny in Silverman III.6.1.

/-- **`[deg φ]` factors through `φ` when the kernel of `φ` has `deg φ` points.** The factor
`χ : W₂ → W₁` with `χ ∘ φ = [deg φ]` is unique; it is the dual isogeny of `φ` (Silverman III.6.1).
The kernel of `φ` is a group of order `deg φ`, so `[deg φ]` kills it, and the kernel form of the
factorisation theorem applies. -/
