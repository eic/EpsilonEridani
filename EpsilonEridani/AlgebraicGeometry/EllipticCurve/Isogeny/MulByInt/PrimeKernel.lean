# Multiplication by a prime

For a prime `ℓ` the non-vanishing hypothesis the division-polynomial construction asks of `[n]` is
supplied by primality rather than assumed, so `mulByPrimeIsogeny` exposes none. Its kernel is the
`ℓ`-torsion, and carries the `ZMod ℓ`-module structure `Kernel.lean` builds for every nonvanishing
`n`, read at `n = ℓ`.

Nothing here assumes anything about the base field beyond its being a field — no algebraic
closure, and no condition on the characteristic. Those enter only when the kernel's cardinality is
computed, which is why they are not imposed at this layer.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.mulByPrimeIsogeny`: multiplication by a prime `ℓ`, with the division
  polynomial's non-vanishing supplied by primality rather than assumed.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.ker_mulByPrimeIsogeny_eq_torsionBy`: its kernel is the `ℓ`-torsion subgroup.
