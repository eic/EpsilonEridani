# The degree of multiplication by `n`

**`deg [n] = n²`.** The degree of an isogeny is the degree of `F(W)` over the image of its
function-field pullback — the pulled-back copy of the *target* function field. For `[n]` the
target is `F(W)` again, and the pullback carries the affine coordinate `x` to `Φₙ / ΨSqₙ`. That
image is pinned down by where the coordinate goes, and `DivisionPolynomialTower.lean` computes
its index as `n²` by way of the intermediate tower `F(Φₙ/ΨSqₙ) ⊆ F(x) ⊆ F(W)`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.fieldPullback_mulByIntIsogeny_X`: the function-field pullback of `[n]` sends
  the affine coordinate to `Φₙ / ΨSqₙ`, read in `F(x)` rather than in the coordinate ring.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.degree_mulByIntIsogeny`: `deg [n] = n²`, for an `n` whose division polynomial
  does not vanish at the generic point, and
  `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.degree_mulByIntIsogenyOfNeZero` for every `n ≠ 0`, that hypothesis being
  discharged from nonsingularity.
