# Separability of multiplication by `n`

Whether `[n]` is separable is decided by its differential, and `[n] = n • id` computes that: the
pullback of the invariant differential along `[n]` is `n • ω`, which vanishes exactly when `n`
does in the base field. In characteristic zero, and in characteristic `p` for `p ∤ n`, `[n]` is
therefore separable, and then nothing is inseparable in it, so its separable degree is its whole
degree `n ²`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.isSeparable_mulByIntIsogeny_iff`: `[n]` is separable exactly when `n` is
  nonzero in the base field.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.separableDegree_mulByIntIsogeny`: in that case its separable degree is `n ²`.
