# The coordinate pullback of multiplication by `n`, for every nonzero `n`

`Isogeny/Basic.lean` gives the identity coordinate pullback and `Isogeny/Frobenius/Basic.lean` gives
the Frobenius one. This file gives `[n]`: multiplication by `n` pulls back to a map
`W.CoordinateRing →ₐ[F] W.FunctionField` wherever `ψₙ` does not vanish at the generic point.

**That non-vanishing is available for every `n ≠ 0` once the curve is nonsingular**, so this
file constructs `[n]` in every characteristic, `[p]` in characteristic `p` included. Two lemmas
discharge it and neither subsumes the other: `psiFunctionField_ne_zero` from `(n : F) ≠ 0`,
which needs no nonsingularity, and `psiFunctionField_ne_zero_of_Δ_ne_zero` from `W.Δ ≠ 0` and
`n ≠ 0`, which needs no hypothesis on the characteristic. `mulByIntPullback` itself, and
everything it is built from, carry neither: they ask for `psiFunctionField W n ≠ 0` directly.

The construction is the division-polynomial formula read at the *generic* point. The coordinate
ring `W.CoordinateRing` is `F[X][Y]` modulo the Weierstrass relation, so the pair `(X, Y)` is
itself a point of `W` over the function field `W.FunctionField` — the generic point. `n` times
it has coordinates `φₙ / ψₙ²` and `ωₙ / ψₙ³` by the division-polynomial formulas, and sending
`X` and `Y` there is exactly a coordinate pullback.

## What is not here

The `MapsInfinity` condition, and so `[n]` as an `Isogeny W W`, are not proved here. Neither
criterion `Isogeny/Basic.lean` offers applies directly: `mapsInfinity_of_pow` wants a fixed
power of every coordinate function to be pulled back, which is the Frobenius shape and not this
one, and `mapsInfinity_iff_isEquiv_comap_infinityPlace` wants the induced map of *function
fields*, which is available only after the pullback below is known injective. That chain —
injectivity, the function-field map, then the place comparison — is its own topic and its own
file. Note the order of dependence: `Isogeny/FunctionField.lean` proves transcendence,
injectivity and the field pullback for *any* isogeny, but each of those consumes
`mapsInfinity`, so none of them can be used to establish it.

Every definition here is paired with a `_def` equation lemma, because a `def`'s body is not
exposed across the module boundary even inside a `public section`: a downstream
`simp only [mulByIntX]` is rejected with *Expected a definition with an exposed body*. Without
them the file cannot be computed with from outside at all.

One fact is the whole content here: `equation_mulByInt`, that the pair `(φₙ/ψₙ², ωₙ/ψₙ³)`
satisfies the equation of the base-changed curve. It is *not* a polynomial identity to be
checked; it holds because `n • P` is a point of the curve whenever `P` is, which is
`WeierstrassCurve.zsmul_point_eq_smulEval` at the generic point.

That the generic point is itself a point of the curve — the other half of the argument — lives
in `Affine/FunctionField/GenericPoint.lean` as
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.equation_genericX_genericY`,
since it is about `W` and not about `[n]`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.mulByIntX`, `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.mulByIntY`: the rational expressions
  `φₙ/ψₙ²` and `ωₙ/ψₙ³`, the coordinates of `[n]` at the generic point where `ψₙ ≠ 0`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.mulByIntPullback`: the coordinate pullback of `[n]`, given `ψₙ ≠ 0`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.mulByIntPullbackOfNeZero`: its specialisation to `n ≠ 0` on an elliptic
  curve, where the non-vanishing is discharged.

The generic point itself (`genericX`, `genericY`) is not defined here; it
is `WeierstrassCurve.Affine`'s, in `Affine/FunctionField/GenericPoint.lean`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.equation_mulByInt`: the coordinates of `[n]` satisfy the equation of `W` over
  its function field.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.psiFunctionField_two_mul`: `ψ_{2n} = preΨ_{2n} · ψ₂` at the generic point.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.psiFunctionField_ne_zero`: `ψₙ` does not vanish at the generic point when
  `(n : F) ≠ 0`, needing no nonsingularity.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.psiFunctionField_ne_zero_of_Δ_ne_zero`: the same conclusion from `W.Δ ≠ 0`
  and `n ≠ 0`, with no hypothesis on the characteristic. These are the two discharges of
  `mulByIntPullback`'s hypothesis; neither subsumes the other.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.phiFunctionField_eq_algebraMap`: `Φₙ` at the generic point is the image of
  the univariate `Φₙ`, the companion of `psiFunctionField_sq` for the numerator.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.mulByIntX_mul_aeval_ΨSq`: the coordinate identity `[n]*x · ΨSqₙ(x) = Φₙ(x)`
  at the generic point, where `ψₙ` does not vanish.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.mulByIntPullback_mk`: the pullback of an arbitrary class, as evaluation of a
  bivariate polynomial at `(φₙ/ψₙ², ωₙ/ψₙ³)`, with `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.mulByIntPullback_X` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.mulByIntPullback_Y` its values on the two coordinates.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.tautologicalPoint_mulByIntPullback`: the tautological point of `[n]` is
  `n • ` the generic point. It lives here, next to the Jacobian-coordinate lemmas it is proved
  from, which stay private.

This is the fact that makes `[n]` a coordinate pullback at all, and it is *not* a polynomial
identity: it holds because `n • P` is again a point of the curve whenever `P` is. Concretely,
`zsmul_point_eq_smulEval` identifies `n • (generic point)` with the Jacobian class of
`(φₙ : ωₙ : ψₙ)`, that class is nonsingular because it is a point, and `ψₙ ≠ 0` lets it be read
in affine coordinates — where it becomes exactly this equation. -/

/-- **`ψₙ` does not vanish at the generic point** when the image of `n` in `F` is nonzero.

The hypothesis is on `n` in `F`, not on `n` in `ℤ`: in characteristic `p` it excludes `n = p`.
It asks nothing about nonsingularity, which is what keeps it useful where
`psiFunctionField_ne_zero_of_Δ_ne_zero` does not apply; neither of the two subsumes the other.
The restriction is inherited from `Mathlib.ΨSq_ne_zero`, and every non-vanishing lemma in
Mathlib's division-polynomial development is conditional the same way — `preΨ_ne_zero`,
`ΨSq_ne_zero`, `Ψ₃_ne_zero`, `preΨ₄_ne_zero` — because each is proved from a leading coefficient
(`(W.ΨSq n).coeff (n.natAbs ^ 2 - 1) = n ^ 2`), exactly what vanishes when `p ∣ n`. -/

/-- **`ψₙ` does not vanish at the generic point of a nonsingular curve, for every `n ≠ 0`** — in
every characteristic, `p ∣ n` included.

This is the characteristic-free discharge of `mulByIntPullback`'s hypothesis, and it is what lets
this file construct `[p]` in characteristic `p`. It trades the condition on the characteristic for
nonsingularity: `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_Δ_ne_zero` gets `ΨSqₙ ≠ 0` from `W.Δ ≠ 0` by way of
`IsCoprime (W.Φ n) (W.ΨSq n)` (Silverman, Exercise III.3.7), which reads the non-vanishing off
coprimality rather than off a leading coefficient. `Δ ≠ 0` is stated as a hypothesis rather than
taken as `[W.IsElliptic]` so that the lemma matches its supplier; `mulByIntPullbackOfNeZero`
supplies it from the instance. -/

/-- **The coordinate pullback of `[n]`.** The point `(φₙ/ψₙ², ωₙ/ψₙ³)` over `W.FunctionField`,
which `equation_mulByInt` says lies on `W`, defines a pullback through
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.evalAlgHom`.

The hypothesis is the weakest one the construction uses: `ψₙ` must not vanish at the generic
point, which is what makes `φₙ/ψₙ²` and `ωₙ/ψₙ³` defined. Two lemmas discharge it —
`psiFunctionField_ne_zero` and `psiFunctionField_ne_zero_of_Δ_ne_zero` — and
`mulByIntPullbackOfNeZero` is the packaged form. -/

`mulByIntPullback` being discharged by `psiFunctionField_ne_zero_of_Δ_ne_zero`. This is the
specialisation to use unless you can supply `ψₙ ≠ 0` yourself.

The hypothesis is on `n` in `ℤ`, so this does give `[p]` in characteristic `p`. Nonsingularity
comes from the `[W.IsElliptic]` instance the definition already carried, which is why taking
`n ≠ 0` here is a strict weakening of the earlier `(n : F) ≠ 0` and costs nothing. -/
