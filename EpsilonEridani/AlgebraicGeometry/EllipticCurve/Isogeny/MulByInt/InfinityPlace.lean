# The place at infinity on the coordinates of `[n]`

`Affine/FunctionField/InfinityPlace/Basic.lean` computes the valuation at infinity of the
coordinate functions: `v_∞ x = exp 2` and `v_∞ y = exp 3`, i.e. `x` has a double pole at `O`
and `y` a triple one. This file does the same for `x ∘ [n]`, the `x`-coordinate of `[n]` at the
generic point built in `Isogeny/MulByInt/Basic.lean`.

The answer, **for `n` nonzero in `F`**, is that nothing changes: `v_∞ (x ∘ [n]) = exp 2 = v_∞ x`.
The pole order at `O` is unaffected by `[n]`, even though the *total* degree of the pole divisor
grows like `n²` — the extra poles sit at the other points of `[n]⁻¹(O)`, not at `O`.

Every result below carries `(n : F) ≠ 0`, inherited from Mathlib's `natDegree_ΨSq`, which reads
the degree of `ψₙ²` off the leading coefficient `n ²`. So `n = 0` and the multiples of the
characteristic are **not** covered: this file does not say what `v_∞ (x ∘ [p])` is in
characteristic `p`. Closing that needs the same `IsCoprime (W.Φ n) (W.ΨSq n)` that
`Isogeny/MulByInt/Basic.lean` records as the gap in `psiFunctionField_ne_zero`.

## The computation

`x ∘ [n]` is `Φₙ / ψₙ²`, and both `Φₙ` and `ψₙ²` are images of *univariate* polynomials: `Φₙ`
by `Affine.CoordinateRing.mk_φ`, and `ψₙ²` by `psiFunctionField_sq`. The valuation of such an
image is read off its degree by `Affine.infinityPlace_algebraMap_polynomial`, which lives in
`Affine/FunctionField/InfinityPlace/Basic.lean` because it is about the function field and not
about `[n]`: `v_∞` is the square of Mathlib's `RatFunc.inftyValuation`, which on a polynomial is
`exp (natDegree)`. So the two
degrees `n²` and `n² - 1` (`natDegree_Φ`, `natDegree_ΨSq`) give `exp (2 * n²)` and
`exp (2 * (n² - 1))`, and the quotient is `exp 2`.

The `- 1` in the second degree is the whole content: it is why the answer is `exp 2` rather
than something growing with `n`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.infinityPlace_phiFunctionField`,
  `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.infinityPlace_psiFunctionField_sq`: the two pole orders, `2n²` and
  `2(n² - 1)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.infinityPlace_mulByIntX`: `v_∞ (x ∘ [n]) = exp 2`, for `(n : F) ≠ 0`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.infinityPlace_mulByIntX_eq_infinityPlace_genericX`: equivalently, for
  `(n : F) ≠ 0`, `[n]` does not change the pole order of `x` at infinity.

  The source states these through its own `ordAtInfty : K(E) → WithTop ℤ` on a
  `SmoothPlaneCurve` wrapper; both are re-based here onto the valuation `infinityPlace` that
  `main` already has, so `ord = -2` appears as `v = exp 2`. Its `ordAtInfty_x_gen`,
  `ordAtInfty_y_gen` and `ordAtInfty_algebraMap_F_nonzero` are **not** ported: they exist as
  `infinityPlace.X`, `infinityPlace.mk_Y` and `infinityPlace.C`.

Not `@[simp]`, unlike the two valuation lemmas around it: `psiFunctionField_sq`
(`Isogeny/MulByInt/Basic.lean`) is itself `@[simp]` and rewrites this left-hand side's argument
`psiFunctionField W n ^ 2`, so the statement is not in simp-normal form and `simpNF` rejects the
tag. Stating it in that normal form instead would remove every mention of `ψₙ`, which is the
content of the lemma — the same trade-off recorded for `infinityPlace.X` in
`Affine/FunctionField/InfinityPlace/Basic.lean`.

The hypothesis is Mathlib's: `natDegree_ΨSq` reads the degree off the leading coefficient `n²`,
which vanishes when the characteristic divides `n`. -/

/-- **`[n]` does not move the pole of `x` at infinity, when `(n : F) ≠ 0`**:
`v_∞ (x ∘ [n]) = exp 2`, the same value `infinityPlace.X` gives for `x` itself. The hypothesis is
on the image of `n` in `F`, so `n = 0` and the multiples of the characteristic are excluded.

The two pole orders `2n²` and `2(n² - 1)` differ by exactly `2`, and that difference is the
answer. The total pole divisor of `x ∘ [n]` does grow with `n`, but its other poles sit at the
remaining points of `[n]⁻¹(O)`, which this valuation does not see. -/
