# The function field is Galois over its pullback along `[n]`

Let `W` be an elliptic curve over a separably closed field `F`, and `n` an integer invertible in
`F`. The pullback of multiplication by `n` embeds the function field `F(W)` in itself, and the
translations by the `n`-torsion points fix its image `[n]^*F(W)`. This file shows that they fix
nothing more, and that there is no other symmetry: `F(W)` is Galois over `[n]^*F(W)`, and every
automorphism of `F(W)` over it is the translation by an `n`-torsion point (AEC III.4.10(c) for
`[n]`).

Everything follows from a count. Over a separably closed field with `n` invertible the kernel of
`[n]` has `n²` points (`EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.card_ker_mulByIntIsogeny`), and `[n]` has degree `n²`
(`EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.degree_mulByIntIsogeny`). An isogeny whose kernel has as many points as its degree
is exactly one whose kernel cuts out the pulled-back field
(`EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.card_ker_eq_degree_iff`), and the two Galois statements are then the Galois
correspondence for the finite translation action
(`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isGalois_translationFixedField` and
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.fixingSubgroup_translationFixedField`).

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.card_ker_mulByIntIsogeny_eq_degree`: `#ker [n] = deg [n]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.translationFixedField_ker_mulByIntIsogeny`: the functions fixed by every
  `n`-torsion translation are exactly the pullbacks along `[n]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.mem_fieldRange_mulByIntIsogeny_iff`: the same, as a membership test.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.isGalois_fieldRange_mulByIntIsogeny`: `F(W)` is Galois over `[n]^*F(W)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.mem_fixingSubgroup_fieldRange_mulByIntIsogeny_iff`: the automorphisms of `F(W)`
  over `[n]^*F(W)` are exactly the translations by `n`-torsion points.

## Use

The Weil pairing uses these results in both directions. A function whose `n`-th power is pulled
back along `[n]` is moved by each `n`-torsion translation only by an `n`-th root of unity, which is
what makes the pairing well defined. A function that no `n`-torsion translation moves is itself
pulled back along `[n]`, which is the step of AEC III.8.1(c) that makes the pairing
nondegenerate.
