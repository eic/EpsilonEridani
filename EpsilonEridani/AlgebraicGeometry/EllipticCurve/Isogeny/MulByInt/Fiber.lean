# How many points `[n]` sends to a given one

The points that `[n]` carries to a fixed `T` form a coset of `ker [n]` as soon as there is one of
them, so there are exactly `#ker [n]` of them — and over an algebraically closed field with `n`
invertible that is `n ²`. The coset count itself is group theory, and lives in
`EpsilonEridani/GroupTheory/Coset/Fiber.lean`; what is added here is the identification of the
kernel with `ker [n]` and the value `n ²`.

The count is what turns a sum over the places above a point into a sum of `n ²` terms, which is how
the pullback of a divisor along `[n]` is read.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.card_zsmul_fiber_eq_card_ker`: a nonempty `[n]`-fiber has as many points as
  `ker [n]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.card_zsmul_fiber`: over an algebraically closed field, for `n` invertible
  there, that count is `n ²`.
