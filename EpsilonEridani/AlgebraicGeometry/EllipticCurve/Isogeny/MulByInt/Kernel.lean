# The kernel of multiplication by `n` is the `n`-torsion

An isogeny in this development has no point map, so its kernel is the subgroup of points whose
translation fixes the pulled-back field (`Isogeny.ker`). For `[n]` that subgroup is the one the
classical statement names: the `n`-torsion of `W` over the base field.

`[n]` is an isogeny only where the division polynomial does not vanish, so the statement carries
`psiFunctionField W n ≠ 0` — the same hypothesis `mulByIntIsogeny` is built from, and not a
restriction beyond it. On an elliptic curve it holds for every `n ≠ 0`, by
`psiFunctionField_ne_zero_of_Δ_ne_zero`.

The bridge is the tautological point. A coordinate pullback is determined by it, that of `[n]` is
`n` times the generic point, and translating by `P` moves the generic point to `g + P`. So the
translation fixes `[n]` exactly when `n • (g + P) = n • g`, which is `n • P = 0`.

Only the base field's points appear, as everywhere in `Isogeny.ker`: this is the rational
`n`-torsion, not the geometric one, and the two differ unless the base field carries the whole
kernel.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.mem_ker_mulByIntIsogeny_iff`: `P ∈ ker [n] ↔ n • P = 0`, for an `n` whose
  division polynomial does not vanish, and
  `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.mem_ker_mulByIntIsogenyOfNeZero_iff`, the same at the `n ≠ 0` the elliptic case
  discharges it from.
* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.ker_mulByIntIsogeny_eq_torsionBy`: the same fact as an equality of subgroups,
  `ker [n] = A[n]` in Mathlib's intrinsic `AddSubgroup.torsionBy` form — the bridge a consumer of
  the torsion API needs.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.kerZModModule`: the `ZMod n`-module structure the equality of subgroups
  transports onto `ker [n]`. It is a global instance, so typeclass synthesis supplies it and a
  consumer writing `Module.finrank (ZMod n) (mulByIntIsogenyOfNeZero W hn).ker` never names it.
