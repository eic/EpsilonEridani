# `[n]` carries `E[n ²]` onto `E[n]`

Multiplication by `n` sends an `n ²`-torsion point to an `n`-torsion point, and once `n` is
invertible in the base field and the geometric `n ²`-torsion is rational that map is **onto**:
every `n`-torsion point is `n` times an `n ²`-torsion point.

The argument is counting, not geometry. `#E[m] = m ²` for every invertible `m`, so `#E[n ²] = n ⁴`
and `#E[n] = n ²`; the kernel of `[n] : E[n ²] → E[n]` consists of `n`-torsion points, so it has at
most `n ²` elements, which is exactly `#E[n ²] / #E[n]`. A homomorphism of finite groups whose
kernel is that small is surjective.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.zsmulTorsionSqHom_surjective_of_torsion_rational`:
  `[n] : E[n ²] → E[n]` is onto.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_zsmul_eq_of_zsmul_eq_zero_of_torsion_rational`: hence every
  `n`-torsion point is `n • P` for some `P` killed by `n ²`.

## Provenance

The counting argument is adapted from the AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0) pinned at
`a302aeacd86053f9d5f991fbbf664e1cc1051d08`, `HasseWeil/HasseBound/WeilPairing/Pairing.lean`,
declarations `mulByEllTorsionHom_surjective` and `exists_preimage_of_torsion`: the same three
steps — the two torsion orders, the kernel's injection into `E[n]`, and
`AddMonoidHom.surjective_of_card_ker_le_div`. The orders come from this repository's own
`card_ker_mulByIntIsogeny_of_torsion_rational` rather than from that project's separable-kernel
torsor, and the statement is on `AddSubgroup.torsionBy` rather than on a bespoke torsion
subgroup.
