# Translation moves the tautological point of Frobenius by the translating point

Translating by a rational point `P` sends the generic point `g` to `g + P`. The tautological point
of the Frobenius isogeny is `g` pushed along the `q`-power map, and that map commutes with
translation and fixes `P`, whose coordinates lie in the base field. So the tautological point of
Frobenius moves by `P` as well.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Isogeny.map_translation_tautologicalPoint_frobeniusIsogeny`: translation by `P` adds
  `P` to the tautological point of Frobenius.
