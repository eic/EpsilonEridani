# Which `x`-coordinates of a Weierstrass curve are attained over a separably closed field

Fixing `x = a` in the Weierstrass equation leaves the monic quadratic
`Y² + (a₁a + a₃)Y − (a³ + a₂a² + a₄a + a₆)` in `Y`, whose derivative is `2Y + (a₁a + a₃)`. A
separably closed field has a root of it unless that derivative vanishes identically, which happens
only in characteristic `2` at an `a` with `a₁a + a₃ = 0`. So `a` is the `x`-coordinate of a
solution away from that case. Combined with the general coordinate descent lemma from
`Affine.BaseChange`, this shows that a solution whose `x`-coordinate is already rational has a
rational `y`-coordinate too.

The excluded case is real. Over the separable closure of `𝔽₂(t)` the equation `y² + y = x³ + t`
has `a₁a + a₃ = 1`, but `y² = x³ + t` — where `a₁ = a₃ = 0` — has `y = √(a³ + t)`, which is purely
inseparable over the base field and need not lie in it. Both statements are about
`Affine.Equation` alone: no nonsingularity and no ellipticity is involved.

The two results are the separably closed companions of `exists_point_on_curve` and
`mem_range_y_of_equation_of_mem_range_x`, which need no side condition because an algebraically
closed field also extracts the inseparable square root.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_point_on_curve_of_isSepClosed`: over a separably closed field,
  an element at which the quadratic in `y` is separable is the `x`-coordinate of a solution of
  `W.Equation`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.mem_range_y_of_equation_of_mem_range_x_of_isSepClosed`: such a solution over an
  extension, with `x`-coordinate in the image of the base field, has its `y`-coordinate there too.

/-- **Over a separably closed field an `x`-coordinate is realised by a point** as soon as the
quadratic in `y` it leaves behind is separable, which is the hypothesis `2 ≠ 0 ∨ a₁a + a₃ ≠ 0`.
In characteristic `2` at an `a` with `a₁a + a₃ = 0` the equation reads `y² = a³ + a₂a² + a₄a + a₆`,
whose solution is purely inseparable over the base field and need not lie in it. -/
