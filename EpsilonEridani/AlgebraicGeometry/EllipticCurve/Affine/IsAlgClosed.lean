# Every `x`-coordinate of a Weierstrass curve over an algebraically closed field is attained

Fixing `x = a` in the Weierstrass equation leaves a monic quadratic in `y`, so over an
algebraically closed field it has a root and `a` is the `x`-coordinate of a solution. The statement
is about `Affine.Equation` alone: no nonsingularity, no ellipticity, and no division polynomial is
involved, which is why it lives here rather than with any consumer.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_point_on_curve`: over an algebraically closed field
  every element is the `x`-coordinate of a solution of `W.Equation`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.mem_range_y_of_equation_of_mem_range_x`: over an algebraically closed field, a
  solution of `W.Equation` whose `x`-coordinate lies in the image of `F` has its `y`-coordinate
  there too.

Stated for an arbitrary affine Weierstrass curve over an algebraically closed field. It yields a
solution of the *equation*, not an element of `W.Point`; a caller wanting a point pairs it with
`equation_iff_nonsingular_of_Δ_ne_zero` or `equation_iff_nonsingular`, which is what makes the
hypothesis-free form the useful one.

## Roadmap

`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:99` — "**`[n]` is division polynomials**". The consumer is
`DivisionPolynomial/Coprimality.lean`, whose proof of `isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq` passes to the algebraic
closure and needs a common root of `Φₙ` and `ΨSqₙ` to be the `x`-coordinate of an actual point.
Nothing here mentions a division polynomial.

## Provenance

Ported, with the author's proof, from AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0), the
HasseWeil project at `dev/hasse-weil @ 513e83879e2f` — the revision
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:1071` pins for that project. Source file
`projects/HasseWeil/HasseWeil/Auxiliary/DivisionPolynomial.lean`, section `Coprimality`,
declaration `exists_point_on_curve`, whose header credits David Kurniadi Angdinata and Junyan Xu.
Upstream it sits beside its coprimality consumer and is stated for a global
`WeierstrassCurve`; here it is separated out and stated for the affine model, which is the level
its content lives at. The degree of the quadratic is `Polynomial.degree_quadratic` here in place of
the source's explicit `natDegree` bound.
