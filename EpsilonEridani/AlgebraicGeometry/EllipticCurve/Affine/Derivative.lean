# The Weierstrass partial derivatives are derivatives

Mathlib defines the two partial derivatives `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.polynomialX` and
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.polynomialY` of the Weierstrass polynomial `W(X, Y)` by explicit
formulae, and marks both definitions with the comment
`TODO: define this in terms of Polynomial.derivative`. This file identifies each of them with the
derivative it is named after.

## Main statements

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.derivative_polynomial`: `W_Y` is `Polynomial.derivative W(X, Y)`, an
  identity of bivariate polynomials. No evaluation is involved: `R[X][Y]` is a polynomial ring in
  `Y` over `R[X]`, so `Polynomial.derivative` already differentiates in `Y`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.equivPolynomial_mapCoeffs_polynomial`: `W_X` is the coefficientwise
  derivative of `W(X, Y)`, again an identity of bivariate polynomials with no evaluation involved.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.derivative_eval_polynomial`: the chain rule along a substitution
  `Y := p`, which expresses `derivative (W(X, p))` through *both* partials. For a constant
  `p = C y` the `Y`-term drops out and this reads `W_X(X, y)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.polynomialY_eq_zero_iff`: `W_Y` vanishes exactly when `2 = 0` and
  `a₁ = a₃ = 0`, the criterion behind `polynomialY_ne_zero`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.polynomialY_ne_zero`: `W_Y` is a nonzero polynomial once `Δ ≠ 0`. This
  is what makes the Weierstrass equation separable in `Y`, and so the function field a separable
  extension of the rational functions in `x`; in characteristic two the leading term of `W_Y`
  vanishes and the discriminant is what rules out `a₁ = a₃ = 0`.

Every statement here holds over an arbitrary commutative ring; only `polynomialY_ne_zero` carries
a further hypothesis, `Δ ≠ 0`.

## Implementation notes

`Polynomial.derivative` on `R[X][Y]` differentiates in `Y`, so `derivative_polynomial` is an
identity of bivariate polynomials with no evaluation anywhere. Differentiating in `X` instead means
differentiating the coefficients, which `Derivation.mapCoeffs` does; reading the result back in
`R[X][Y]` along `PolynomialModule.equivPolynomial` gives the shape standing on the right of
`Polynomial.Bivariate.pderiv_zero_equivMvPolynomial`, so no `MvPolynomial` transport is needed to
state that partial either.

Each partial is therefore stated bare and one at a time, and the chain rule is *derived* from the
two rather than taken as primitive: `derivative_eval_polynomial` follows from
`equivPolynomial_mapCoeffs_polynomial` and `derivative_polynomial` through
`Derivation.apply_eval_eq`. The substituted form remains the one most consumers meet, so it is
kept, but it is now a corollary of the bare identities rather than the only statement of them.

## Provenance

Two of the three identities come from the proof of
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.nonsingular_of_isUnit_XYIdeal` in `Affine/Point/ToClass.lean`,
which is itself ported from the AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, by Chris Birkbeck), where they were local `have`s
over a field, stated after evaluating at a point.

They are restated here to different degrees, and only one of them is a straight extraction.
`derivative_polynomial` is the identity the `have` already had, moved ahead of the evaluation and
over a commutative ring. `derivative_eval_polynomial` goes beyond its `have`: that one covered
only the constant substitution `p = C y`, for which the `Y`-term drops out, so the chain rule for
an arbitrary `p : R[X]` is a generalisation of it rather than an extraction of it. The constant
case is what the call site in `ToClass.lean` recovers.

`equivPolynomial_mapCoeffs_polynomial` has no counterpart in the source: the `have`s worked
with the substituted form throughout, and the bare `X`-partial is stated here for the first time.
