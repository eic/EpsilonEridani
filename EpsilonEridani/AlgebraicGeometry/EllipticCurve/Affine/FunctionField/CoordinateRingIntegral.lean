# Valuations of a Weierstrass function field that are integral on the coordinate ring

For a valuation of `F(W)` trivial on `F`, having no pole at the coordinate `x` forces the valuation
to be at most `1` on the whole coordinate ring: `W.CoordinateRing` is integral over `F[x]`, and a
valuation is at most `1` exactly on what is integral over its integers. This bounds those elements;
it does not compute their values.

This is the affine-chart half of the classification of such valuations. The other half is
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isEquiv_infinityPlace_of_one_lt`, which settles the case `1 < v x`: there
the valuation is the place at infinity. Neither half needs any `Place` packaging — no
normalization, no surjectivity, no Dedekind hypothesis and no ellipticity — which is why they are
stated for a bare valuation.

## Main results

* `Valuation.algebraMap_coordinateRing_le_one`: a valuation trivial on `F` with `v x ≤ 1` is at
  most `1` on the whole coordinate ring.
