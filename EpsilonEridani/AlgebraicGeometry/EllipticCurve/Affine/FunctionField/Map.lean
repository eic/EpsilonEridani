# The function field along a homomorphism of the base field

Mathlib carries a Weierstrass curve along a ring homomorphism `f : R →+* S` (`WeierstrassCurve.map`)
and carries its coordinate ring along with it (`CoordinateRing.map`, injective when `f` is). This
file carries the *function* field: for `f : F →+* K` a homomorphism of fields, `F(W)` embeds into
`K(W.map f)`.

There is nothing to choose. `F(W)` is the fraction field of the domain `F[W]`, and `F[W]` lands
in the field `K(W.map f)` injectively, so the embedding is the unique extension of that
composite across fractions — `IsFractionRing.lift`. What the file records is how the embedding
meets everything else: the two coordinates, the scalars, and composition of base maps.

The scalar compatibility `map_algebraMap` is the load-bearing one. Read as an equality of ring
homomorphisms out of `F` it says the square

```text
    F  ──────────────▸  K
    │                   │
    ▾                   ▾
  F(W)  ────────────▸  K(W.map f)
```

commutes, and `map_map_algebraMap` is that square applied to the coefficients of a second curve:
a curve `W₂` over `F` base-changed to `F(W₁)` and then carried along the embedding is the same
curve as `W₂.map f` base-changed to `K(W₁.map f)`. That equality is what lets a point of `W₂`
over `F(W₁)` — equivalently, by the universal property in `Isogeny/Basic.lean`, a coordinate
pullback — be pushed to a point of `W₂.map f` over `K(W₁.map f)`.

The homomorphism of base fields is an arbitrary `f : F →+* K`, not an `algebraMap`. Base change
along a field extension is the case `f = algebraMap F K`, while an automorphism `f = σ` gives the
semilinear transport of `F(W)` to the function field of the conjugate curve `W.map σ`. The latter
is the raw material for a Galois action but is not itself one: the target is `K(W.map σ)`, not
`K(W)`, so an action would additionally need the identification `W.map σ = W` for a curve defined
over the fixed field together with its coherence laws, and none of that is built into the
statements here. A single map covers both readings, and neither is built in.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.FunctionField.map`: the embedding `F(W) → K(W.map f)`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.FunctionField.map_algebraMap_coordinateRing`: it restricts to
  `CoordinateRing.map` on the coordinate ring, which is what pins it down.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.FunctionField.map_algebraMap` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.FunctionField.map_comp_algebraMap`: it is compatible with the scalars,
  in element and in composed form.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.FunctionField.map_genericX` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.FunctionField.map_genericY`: it sends the generic point of `W` to the
  generic point of `W.map f`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.FunctionField.map_id`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.FunctionField.map_map`, and its homomorphism-level companion
  `map_comp_map`: functoriality in `f`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.FunctionField.map_map_algebraMap`: the commuting square above, at the
  level of a second curve base-changed to the function field.

## Roadmap

`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, **Layer 0.5** (README:369), whose first milestone
(README:376-378) asks for "base change of Weierstrass equations, coordinate rings, function
fields, points, and isogenies". This is the function-field entry of that list; the isogeny entry
is `Isogeny/BaseChange.lean`, which is what consumes everything here.
