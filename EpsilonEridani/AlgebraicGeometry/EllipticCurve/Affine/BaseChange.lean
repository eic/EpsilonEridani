# Base change of affine elliptic curves

Mathlib carries ellipticity through `WeierstrassCurve.map`. This module exposes the same instance
for the canonical affine base-change spelling `W⁄A`, so consumers of the point and function-field
base-change APIs do not have to unfold that abbreviation. It also records that base change along
the identity algebra map returns the original curve, together with the resulting identification
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.equivBaseChangeSelf` of the point groups of `W` and `W⁄F`, and a
coordinate descent lemma for points whose abscissa is already rational.

This is infrastructure for the base-change lane of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, Layer 0.5.
