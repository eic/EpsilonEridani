# The points with a pole at a place form a subgroup

Let `W` be an elliptic curve over `F`, let `K` be a field extension of `F` and let `P` be a place
of `K / F`. A point of `W` over `K` either has both coordinates in the valuation ring of `P` or has
a pole of `x` there (`Affine/ValuationIntegrality.lean`). This file shows that the points with a
pole, together with the point at infinity, form a subgroup of `W(K)`. These are the `K`-points
lying in the kernel `E₁(K_P)` of reduction at `P` on the completion `K_P` (Silverman VII.2.2); no
reduction map is constructed here, the subgroup being cut out by the valuation of the
`x`-coordinate alone (at a place of degree one, `Affine/Point/DegreeOneReduction.lean` builds one
from it).

The group law on the points of an affine Weierstrass curve depends definitionally on the chosen
`DecidableEq K`, so that instance is a parameter of every declaration here rather than being fixed
classically: the statements apply to the point operations of whatever instance is in context, in
particular to the function field of a curve with its own.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.polePoints`: the subgroup of `W(K)` of points whose `x`-coordinate has
  a pole at `P`, together with the point at infinity.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.one_lt_valuation_xCoord_add`: a pole of `x` at `P` is preserved by
  addition of points, as long as the sum is not the point at infinity.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.mem_polePoints_iff`: membership in `polePoints`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.baseChange_mem_polePoints_iff`: a point of `W` over `F` lies in
  `polePoints` only if it is the point at infinity, so a point of `W` over `K` is congruent to at
  most one point of `W` over `F` modulo `polePoints` (`eq_of_sub_mem_polePoints`).

## Provenance

Built on `WeierstrassCurve.range_formalPointHomAdicCompletion` (`FormalGroup/Point/Range.lean`,
adapted there from Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` development) and `EpsilonEridani.Place.center`
