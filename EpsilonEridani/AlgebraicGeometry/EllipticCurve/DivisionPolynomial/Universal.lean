# Division polynomials of the universal curve

Every Weierstrass curve is a specialization of the universal one, and division polynomials commute
with base change. Composing the two identifies the division polynomials of a curve `W` over `R`,
evaluated at a point `(x, y)` of the affine plane, with those of `Universal.curve` pushed forward
along `Universal.polyEval`.

Each proof is the same two steps: unfold `polyEval` into a `map` followed by `evalEval`
(`polyEval_apply`), then rewrite the base change of the universal curve back to `W`
(`map_specialize`). The division polynomial in between is carried across by the relevant Mathlib
`map_*` lemma.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.evalEval_ψ₂`, `.evalEval_Ψ₃`, `.evalEval_preΨ₄`, `.evalEval_ψ`,
  `.evalEval_φ`, `.evalEval_ω`, `.evalEval_ψc`: the polynomials `ψ₂`, `Ψ₃`, `ψₙ`, `φₙ`, `ωₙ` and
  the complement `ψc n` of `W` at `(x, y)`, together with the auxiliary `preΨ₄`, are the
  universal ones evaluated through `Universal.polyEval`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.isEllipticNet_polyToField_ψ`: the universal `ψ` family, taken
  into `Universal.Field`, is an elliptic net.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.polyEval_cusp_ψ`, `.polyEval_cusp_φ`, `.polyEval_cusp_ψc`,
  `.polyEval_cusp_ω`: specialised to the cusp curve at `(1, 1)`, `ψₙ` evaluates to `n` itself,
  the numerator `φₙ` to `1`, the complement `ψc n` to `2`, and `ωₙ` to `1`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.polyToField_ψ_ne_zero`, `.polyToField_φ_ne_zero`: in
  `Universal.Field`, `ψₙ` is nonzero for every `n ≠ 0` and `φₙ` for every `n` — the cusp
  evaluations above, read back through the retraction onto `ℤ`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Universal.polyToField_Ψ₂Sq`: `Ψ₂Sq` is the square of `ψ 2` in the universal
  field, the Weierstrass relation being exactly what `Universal.Ring` quotients out.

## Implementation notes

`Ψ₃` and `preΨ₄` are univariate, so their statements evaluate `C W.Ψ₃` rather than `W.Ψ₃`; the two
extra rewrites in those proofs (`map_C`, `coe_mapRingHom`) only move that `C` past the base change.

`polyEval_cusp_ψ` is where the three transport lemmas above earn their keep. `Cusp.lean` collapses
`ψ₂`, `Ψ₃` and `preΨ₄` on `cusp R` to `2Y`, `3X⁴` and `2X⁶`; rewriting the transports backwards
turns `polyEval (cusp ℤ) 1 1 (curve.ψ n)` into those three evaluated at `(1, 1)`, which are `2`,
`3` and `2` — so the sequence is `normEDS 2 3 2`, and the identity of #3364 finishes it. That is
the only reason this file imports `Cusp.lean`.

**`polyEval_cusp_φ` does not port as written, and the reason is the module system rather than a
missing prerequisite.** The source closes it with `simp_rw [φ, map_sub, …, polyEval]`, unfolding
`polyEval`'s definition, which is rejected across a module boundary — *"Invalid simp theorem
`polyEval`: Expected a definition with an exposed body"*. Supplying the equation lemma instead does
not help either: `polyEval`'s image lives in `Poly`, whose `Sub` and `Mul` instances are themselves
unexposed, so a bare `map_sub` cannot solve `?f` in the pattern `?f (?a - ?b)` and fails to fire at
all. **Naming the ring hom is what fixes it** — `map_sub (polyEval (cusp ℤ) 1 1)` makes the match
first-order, and the same for `map_mul` and `map_pow`. That leaves the arithmetic
`polyEval (cusp ℤ) 1 1 (C X) * n ^ 2 - (n + 1) * (n - 1) = 1`, which `ring` closes once `C X`
evaluates to `1`.

The remaining two companions, `polyEval_cusp_ψc` and `polyEval_cusp_ω`, together with the sixth
and seventh transports `evalEval_ψc` and `evalEval_ω`, needed `ψc`, `two_mul_ω`, `map_ψc` and
`map_ω` — the `ω` API this passage once recorded as not yet here. `DivisionPolynomial/Omega.lean`
now supplies all four, on top of `reducedInvarNum_eq_reducedInvarDenom_mul`, so they are below:
`evalEval_ψc` and `evalEval_ω` close the transport family, `polyEval_cusp_ψc` reads the
complement off `complEDS₂_two_three_two`, and `polyEval_cusp_ω` divides the cusp evaluation of
`two_mul_ω` by two.

## Provenance

Adapted from `LutzNagell/ZSMul.lean` in AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0),
at `dev/modular-curves @ 9fec8eba7652` — the revision `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`
pins for the NagellLutz project. Declarations `Universal.evalEval_ψ₂`, `evalEval_Ψ₃`,
`evalEval_preΨ₄`, `evalEval_ψ`, `evalEval_φ` and (added with the `ω` port, read at
`main @ 1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`) `evalEval_ψc` and `evalEval_ω`.
`isEllipticNet_polyToField_ψ` adapts that same file's `net_ψᵤ` (`:140`); the source's neighbouring
`isEllSequence_ψᵤ` (`:139`) is the `s = 0` shift of it and is not separately ported, since
`IsEllipticNet.isEllipticSequence` recovers it.
That file's header reads `Authors: David Kurniadi Angdinata, Junyan Xu`; following this
repository's convention for adapted material the upstream authorship is credited here rather than
in the copyright header.

`polyEval_cusp_ψ` and `polyEval_cusp_φ` adapt that same file's declarations of those names, at the
roadmap's NagellLutz pin `dev/modular-curves @ 9fec8eba7652`. Three changes. `ψ` and `φ` need
qualifying, because this file opens `Universal` rather than `WeierstrassCurve` alone. The source's
`normEDS_two_three_two` hint is dropped rather than renamed — `normEDS_two_three_two_eq_id` is
redundant here, since #3364's general `normEDS_two_three_two_eq_intCast` is `@[simp]` and reaches
the same normal form first. And `polyEval_cusp_φ`'s proof is restructured for the reason given
above: the source's unfold of `polyEval` is unavailable, so each `map_*` names its ring hom.
The source's `polyEval_cusp_ψc` and `polyEval_cusp_ω` are adapted below (read at
`main @ 1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`), with the same two mechanical changes as
their siblings — qualified names, ring-hom-named `map_*` rewrites in place of unfolding
`polyEval` — plus `ψc_def` in place of unfolding `ψc`, whose body is likewise unexposed.

The `evalEval_*` statements are the source's unchanged. Docstrings are added here, and the
source's shared `variable {m n : ℤ}` is narrowed to `n`: of the seven transports only
`evalEval_ψ`, `evalEval_φ`, `evalEval_ω` and `evalEval_ψc` carry an index, and all four use `n`
alone. `net_ψᵤ` is stated upstream through
an `abbrev ψᵤ` and its own `ψᵤ_eq_normEDS`; here the abbreviation is dropped, the identification
of `ψ` with `normEDS` is the named `ψ_eq_normEDS` (`DivisionPolynomial/NormEDS.lean`), and a
`have` transports it through `polyToField`, so the statement is spelled on
`fun n ↦ polyToField (curve.ψ n)` directly.

The nonvanishing block adapts, at the same `main` revision, `ψᵤ_ne_zero` (`:142`, respelt
`polyToField_ψ_ne_zero` with the abbreviation dropped as above), `polyToField_φ_ne_zero` (`:148`,
source name kept) and `polyToField_ψ₂Sq` (`:154`, here `polyToField_Ψ₂Sq`: the constant in its
conclusion is `Ψ₂Sq`, capitalised). The first two port essentially unchanged, both retracting to
the cusp curve at `(1, 1)` through `ringEval`, where `ψₙ` reads off as `n` and `φₙ` as `1`. One
departure beyond the `ψᵤ` respelling, and it is confined to `polyToField_Ψ₂Sq`: the source expands
`ψ₂_sq` and clears the Weierstrass polynomial term by hand with `polyToField_polynomial`. That
lemma exists here too (`EllipticCurve/Universal.lean`), but this proof does not need it — Mathlib
packages the same cancellation as the coordinate-ring identity `Affine.CoordinateRing.mk_ψ₂_sq`,
which is what the proof pushes into the field of fractions.

— including `NormEDS.lean`'s `universalNormEDS_ne_zero` — within reach of the universal division
polynomials. The elliptic-*sequence* consequence is the shift `s = 0`, which
`IsEllipticNet.isEllipticSequence` reads off; consumers that need a nonzero shift, as the
