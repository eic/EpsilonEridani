# The roots of `ΨSqₙ` are the abscissae of the nonzero `n`-torsion

`ΨSqₙ` is the square of the `n`-division polynomial, pushed down to a polynomial in `x` alone. Its
roots are exactly the `x`-coordinates of the affine points killed by `n`: one direction holds over
any field, the other needs the base field algebraically closed, so that the `y` completing a root
to a point exists.

This is the dictionary the `n`-torsion is counted through — the kernel of `[n]` maps to the roots
of `ΨSqₙ` two-to-one away from the `2`-torsion, which is what matches `#ker [n] = n ²` against
`deg preΨₙ`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_iff_exists_zsmul_eq_zero`: over an algebraically closed
  field, the roots of `ΨSqₙ` are exactly the abscissae of the `n`-torsion points. The pointwise
  form, for a supplied `y`, is `eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_iff_zsmul_eq_zero` in
  `DivisionPolynomial/ZSMul.lean`; only the existence of `y` needs the closure assumption.

/-- **Over an algebraically closed field the roots of `ΨSqₙ` are exactly the abscissae of the
`n`-torsion points.** Solving the Weierstrass equation for `y` gives a point over a root, and
`ΨSqₙ(x) = 0` makes `ψₙ` vanish there, which annihilates it; the converse needs no closure, since
the `y` is supplied. -/
