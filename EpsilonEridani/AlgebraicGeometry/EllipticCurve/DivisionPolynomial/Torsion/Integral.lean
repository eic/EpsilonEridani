# A torsion point's `x`-coordinate is integral over the base field

`ΨSqₙ` is a nonzero polynomial over the base field whenever `n ≠ 0` and the curve is nonsingular,
and a torsion point is a root of it. So the `x`-coordinate of an affine point killed by a nonzero
`n` is integral over the base, with no hypothesis on the extension.

Over an algebraically closed base that integrality becomes rationality; that is
`Torsion/AlgClosed.lean`, which is the only place algebraic closedness is used.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.isIntegral_x_of_zsmul_eq_zero`: the `x`-coordinate of an affine point killed
  by a nonzero `n` is integral over the base field.
