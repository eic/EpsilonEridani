# The discriminant companion of Nagell–Lutz

Over `ℤ`, a torsion point with integral coordinates either has `ψ₂ = 0` there or has `ψ₂²` dividing
`4Δ`. Writing `κ = ψ₂(x₀, y₀) = 2y₀ + a₁x₀ + a₃`, that is the classical `y = 0 ∨ y² ∣ Δ` disjunct
in the form a long Weierstrass model supports.

Over the fraction field of a general unique factorisation domain the same holds **given a
squarefreeness hypothesis**, exactly as in `NagellLutz.lean`: this route applies integrality at
`2 • P`, so what it needs is squarefreeness at the primes dividing that point's order. Over `ℤ`
that discharges for free, which is why the specialisation carries no arithmetic hypothesis.

The arithmetic is already in `Discriminant.lean`, which proves — for any commutative ring, any `x`
and **any** divisor `d` — that `d ∣ Ψ₂Sq(x)` and `d ∣ 4·Ψ₃(x)` together give `d ∣ 4Δ`, by an
explicit Bézout certificate in the `b`-invariants. What this file adds is the torsion input that
discharges the second premise, which that file deliberately left open: *"its hypothesis
`κ² ∣ 4·Ψ₃(x)` is supplied by point-level `[n]`-multiplication material that is not yet in this
repository"*. It is now, so the premise can be met.

The route is doubling. `κ ≠ 0` forces `2 • P ≠ 0`, so `2 • P` has an affine representative
`(x', y')`, and the cleared doubling relation `x' · ΨSq₂(x₀) = Φ₂(x₀)` turns `Ψ₃(x₀)` into
`(x₀ - x') · Ψ₂Sq(x₀)`, which on the curve is `(x₀ - x') · κ²`. Nagell–Lutz integrality applied at
`2 • P` makes `x'` integral — or, in its order-two case, makes `4x'` integral — and either way the
`4` already present on the left absorbs the difference.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.evalEval_ψ₂_eq_zero_or_sq_dvd_four_mul_Δ`: the companion over a UFD `R`,
  taking the same sharp disjunction as `isInteger_or_order_two_of_torsion` but read at `2 • P`,
  guarded by `2 < addOrderOf (2 • P)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.evalEval_ψ₂_eq_zero_or_sq_dvd_four_mul_Δ_of_squarefree`: the same conclusion
  from a *uniform* hypothesis — squarefreeness at every prime dividing `addOrderOf (2 • P)` —
  which is strictly stronger but is the form a caller usually has.
* `WeierstrassCurve.evalEval_ψ₂_eq_zero_or_sq_dvd_four_mul_Δ_rat`: the `ℤ`/`ℚ` specialisation,
  assuming only that the point is torsion with integral coordinates.

## Why the hypothesis sits at `2 • P`, and why its guard is `2 <` rather than `≠ 2`

Integrality is applied at `2 • P`, not at `P`, and the sharp disjunction does **not** transfer
along `addOrderOf (2 • P) ∣ addOrderOf P`: at `addOrderOf P = 12` it is satisfied by its left
disjunct, supplying only `Squarefree (2 : R)`, whereas `addOrderOf (2 • P) = 6` has `4 ∤ 6` and so
forces the right disjunct, needing `Squarefree (3 : R)`, which nothing provided. Asking it at
`2 • P` instead removes the transfer, and is what the proof genuinely consumes.

The guard is then `2 < addOrderOf (2 • P)` rather than the `≠ 2` used one file down, and the
difference is not cosmetic: it is what keeps the hypothesis **satisfiable**. If `P` has order two
then `2 • P = 0` and `addOrderOf (2 • P) = 1`, where `≠ 2` holds but neither `4 ∣ 1` nor
`∃ p prime, p ∣ 1` does — a caller would be asked for a false disjunction. Order `1` cannot arise
in `isInteger_or_order_two_of_torsion`, whose point is a `.some`, which is why `≠ 2` suffices
there; here the point is a double and may vanish, so the guard must exclude `1` as well.

## Roadmap

New mathematics: `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:821` — "**The torsion subgroup and
Nagell–Lutz**". Line `:827` names this target as `lutz_nagell_integrality_general`'s "discriminant
companion". The short-model sharpening is separate and already present, as
`CubicDiscriminant.lean`'s `sq_dvd_cubic_discr`.

## Provenance

Ported from J. Xu and D. K. Angdinata's
`projects/NagellLutz/LutzNagell/LutzNagellTheorem/PIDMain.lean` in AINTLIB
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, `main @ 1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`):
`kappa_sq_dvd_four_Psi3_of_torsion` (`:356`) and `lutz_nagell_pid_discriminant_of_torsion`
(`:415`). That file is byte-identical at `9fec8eba7652`, the revision the roadmap pins for this
project (`README:1072`), verified by blob hash, so the citations hold at either.

Two further declarations of that source file land elsewhere. `addOrderOf_ne_two_of_kappa_ne_zero`
(`:279`) is ported **into `ZSMul.lean`**, beside the `evalEval_ψ_eq_zero_of_zsmul_eq_zero` its
proof consumes, and strengthened twice on the way. It is **generalised**: the source states it
over the fraction field of a PID at integral coordinates, but nothing in the argument sees the base
ring, so it is stated over the point's own field and the transport across `algebraMap` happens
here, at the call site. And it is **an equivalence**,
`addOrderOf_eq_two_iff_evalEval_ψ₂_eq_zero`: a vanishing `ψₙ` annihilates the point, which at
`n = 2` is the converse direction, and this file uses the `.mp` direction contrapositively.
`curveR_equation_of_isInteger` (`:266`) is not ported at all: it is Mathlib's
`Affine.map_equation` with the coordinates substituted, so this file applies that lemma directly.

**Most of the source's discriminant section is not ported, because this repository already carries
it.** `kappa_sq_eq_Psi2Sq` (`:183`), `bezout_identity` (`:192`) and `kappa_sq_dvd_four_delta`
(`:202`) are `Discriminant.lean`'s `evalEval_ψ₂_sq`, `bezout_four_mul_Δ` and
`dvd_four_mul_Δ_of_dvd_Ψ₂Sq_of_dvd_four_mul_Ψ₃` — the last of which is *more general*, taking an
arbitrary `d` where the source fixes `κ²`. The four `eval`-level wrappers (`:300`–`:352`) collapse
into `Basic.lean`'s `eval_Ψ₃_eq_sub_mul_eval_Ψ₂Sq`, and `isInteger_mul_of_den_dvd` (`:338`) is
`NumDen.lean`'s `den_dvd_iff_isInteger_mul`. The source's `lutz_nagell_pid_discriminant` (`:242`)
is likewise declined: it is the on-curve specialisation of the general divisibility, and stating
it separately would add a name for what the headline below already does with the point in hand.

Two adaptations. The base ring is a **UFD**, matching `Torsion/Basic.lean` and
`isInteger_or_order_two_of_torsion`, rather than the source's principal ideal domain of
characteristic zero. And `κ` is written as `W.ψ₂.evalEval x₀ y₀` rather than the raw
`2y₀ + a₁x₀ + a₃`, so that `evalEval_ψ₂_sq` applies without a normalisation step.

/-- **The `Ψ₃` divisibility, from torsion.** For a torsion point with integral coordinates and
`κ = ψ₂(x₀, y₀) ≠ 0`, the square `κ²` divides `4·Ψ₃(x₀)`.

`κ ≠ 0` makes `2 • P` nonzero, so it has an affine representative `(x', y')`, and the cleared
doubling relation turns `Ψ₃(x₀)` into `(x₀ - x') · Ψ₂Sq(x₀) = (x₀ - x') · κ²`. Nagell–Lutz
integrality at `2 • P` then makes `x'` integral — or, in its order-two case, makes `4x'` integral,
and the `4` is already on the left. -/

squarefreeness at *every* prime dividing `addOrderOf (2 • P)` rather than at the one branch the
proof lands in.

That is strictly stronger, and it is the form a caller usually has, because it needs no knowledge
of which branch the order falls into. The bridge between the two is
`Algebra/Squarefree.lean`'s `Nat.four_dvd_or_exists_odd_prime_and_dvd_of_squarefree`, shared
with
`isInteger_or_order_two_of_torsion_of_squarefree` one file down, which this mirrors — including
its guard: the branch that `2 < addOrderOf (2 • P)` excludes consumes no squarefreeness, so
requiring it there would exclude order-four points over a base in which `2` ramifies. -/
