# Torsion points over a separably closed field are already rational

An `n`-torsion point of `W` with coordinates in an extension of a separably closed `F` already has
them in `F`, provided `n` is invertible in `F`. Its abscissa is integral over `F` with separable
minimal polynomial, and the ordinate then solves a quadratic whose other root is its negative.

Invertibility of `n` is what the separability rests on, and it cannot be dropped. Over the
separable closure `K` of `𝔽₂(t)` the curve `y² + xy = x³ + t` has discriminant `t`, so it is
elliptic, and its nonzero `2`-torsion point is `(0, √t)`: the geometric `2`-torsion is
nontrivial while the `2`-torsion over `K` itself is not.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.mem_range_x_of_zsmul_eq_zero_of_isSepClosed`: the abscissa of an `n`-torsion
  point over an extension of a separably closed field, with `n` invertible, is already rational.
* `WeierstrassCurve.mem_range_baseChange_of_zsmul_eq_zero_of_isSepClosed`: the whole torsion point
  is the base change of one over the separably closed field.
