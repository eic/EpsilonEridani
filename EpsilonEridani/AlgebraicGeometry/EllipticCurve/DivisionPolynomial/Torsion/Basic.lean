# Integrality of torsion away from order two, under a squarefree hypothesis

The Nagell–Lutz statement is that a torsion point of an integral Weierstrass model has integral
coordinates. **This file does not prove that.** It proves the cases a squarefree hypothesis makes
accessible — an `n`-torsion point for odd `n` with `(n : R)` squarefree, or for even `n` with
`(n / 2 : R)` squarefree provided the point is not itself two-torsion — over an arbitrary unique
factorisation domain `R` with fraction field `K` rather than only over `ℤ/ℚ`. Order two is
genuinely excluded: such a point need not be integral, and what is proved instead is the
denominator bound `den(x) ∣ 4`.

The bridge from the group law to polynomials is `ZSMul.lean`'s
`evalEval_ψ_eq_zero_of_zsmul_eq_zero`: if
`n • P = 0` then `ψₙ` vanishes at `P`. That turns a torsion hypothesis into a polynomial root,
and the root feeds `isInteger_x_of_equation_of_is_root_of_squarefree_leadingCoeff` from
`EllipticCurve/Integrality.lean`, whose squarefree-leading-coefficient hypothesis is supplied by
Mathlib's `leadingCoeff_preΨ` (`= n` for odd `n` and `= n / 2` for even `n`) and
`leadingCoeff_Ψ₂Sq` (`= 4`). Only the `x`-coordinate is stated: `y` is then integral by
`Integrality.lean`'s `isInteger_y_of_equation_of_isInteger_x`, which needs nothing about torsion.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.isInteger_x_of_odd_torsion_of_squarefree`: for an **odd** `n` with `(n : R)`
  squarefree, an `n`-torsion point has integral `x`. The odd-prime case the Nagell–Lutz route
  quotes is the specialisation `n = p`; primality is not used.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isInteger_x_of_even_torsion_of_squarefree`: for an **even** `n` with
  `(n / 2 : R)` squarefree and `(2 : R) ≠ 0`, an `n`-torsion point that is not two-torsion has
  integral `x`. `WeierstrassCurve.isInteger_x_of_order_four_of_squarefree` is the case `n = 4`,
  where `4 / 2 = 2` collapses both arithmetic premises into `Squarefree (2 : R)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.den_dvd_four_of_order_two`: order two is the genuine exception — the
  coordinates need not be integral, but the denominator of `x` divides `4`.

## Roadmap

New mathematics: `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:821` — "**The torsion subgroup and
Nagell–Lutz**", whose route is stated at `:830`–`:831` as "division polynomials". The roadmap asks
for the theorem over `ℚ` for both integral models; these are the UFD-level statements that
specialise to it.

## Provenance

Ported from J. Xu and D. K. Angdinata's
`projects/NagellLutz/LutzNagell/LutzNagellTheorem/PIDPrimeOrder.lean` in AINTLIB
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, `main @ 1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`):
`x_isInteger_of_odd_prime_torsion_squarefree`
(`:118`), `two_nsmul_eq_zero_of_ψ₂_eq_zero` (`:143`), `integrality_of_order_four_squarefree`
(`:156`) and `den_dvd_of_order_two` (`:183`). That file is byte-identical at `9fec8eba7652`, the
revision the roadmap pins, so the citations hold at either.

Its remaining two declarations are **already in this repository** and are called rather than
restated: `isInteger_of_root_squarefree_leading_coeff` (`:88`) is `Integrality.lean`'s
`isInteger_x_of_equation_of_is_root_of_squarefree_leadingCoeff`, and
`y_isInteger_of_x_isInteger_on_curve` (`:42`) is its `isInteger_y_of_equation_of_isInteger_x`.

Five adaptations. The source's `curveK R K W` (`PIDCurve.lean:32`) is **not ported**: it is a bare
abbreviation for `W.map (algebraMap R K)`, and Mathlib defines `W.baseChange K` to be exactly that
— `rfl`-equal — so this file uses `baseChange`, matching `Integrality.lean` and `Denominator.lean`.
Its companion `curveK_equation_iff` is then just `Affine.equation_iff` and is not needed at all.
Two wrappers are likewise declined because this repository already carries both of their halves:
`evalEval_ψ_odd` (`EvalBridge.lean:62`) is the one-line composite
`(evalEval_ψ_eq_evalEval_Ψ …).trans (evalEval_Ψ_odd …)`, inlined here at its one call site; and
`prime_order_integrality_squarefree` (`:205`) is the conjunction of
`x_isInteger_of_odd_prime_torsion_squarefree` with `y_isInteger_of_x_isInteger_on_curve`, so
callers pair `isInteger_x_of_odd_torsion_of_squarefree` with
`isInteger_y_of_equation_of_isInteger_x` directly.
The source's `evalEval_ψ_eq_zero_of_zsmul_eq_zero` (`:67`) is ported, but **into `ZSMul.lean`**
rather than here: it is a field-level corollary of `zsmul_point_eq_smulEval` with no UFD content,
so placing it beside its own input keeps consumers of the scalar-multiplication bridge from having
to import this file. It also drops the source's `[DecidableEq F]`, which EpsilonEridani's
`zsmul_point_eq_smulEval` does not require. Finally the names are restated to describe their
conclusions: `x_isInteger_of_odd_prime_torsion_squarefree` →
`isInteger_x_of_odd_torsion_of_squarefree` (**generalised**: the source assumes an odd prime, but
primality is used there only to rule out `n = 2`, so this holds for any odd index and covers odd
composite torsion), `integrality_of_order_four_squarefree` →
`isInteger_x_of_even_torsion_of_squarefree` (**generalised** the same way: the source's argument
splits `ψ₄ = preΨ₄ * ψ₂` and reads off `leadingCoeff preΨ₄ = 2`, and `Ψ n = C (preΨ n) * ψ₂` with
`leadingCoeff (preΨ n) = n / 2` runs it verbatim at every even index; the source's own index is
kept as `isInteger_x_of_order_four_of_squarefree`), `den_dvd_of_order_two` →
`den_dvd_four_of_order_two`, `two_nsmul_eq_zero_of_ψ₂_eq_zero` →
`zsmul_eq_zero_of_evalEval_ψ_eq_zero` at `n = 2`: a vanishing `ψₙ` annihilates the point at every
index, and two-torsion is the case `n = 2`. It is stated for the Jacobian point, so the even-index
theorem needs no `[DecidableEq K]`, and it carries no integrality content, so it lives in
`DivisionPolynomial/ZSMul.lean`.

/-- For an **odd** `n` with `(n : R)` squarefree, an `n`-torsion point has integral
`x`-coordinate.

`ψₙ` vanishes at the point; for odd `n` that value is `preΨₙ` evaluated at `x` alone, whose
leading coefficient is `n` — squarefree by hypothesis, which is what the rational-root argument
in `Integrality.lean` needs.

Oddness is the only arithmetic input: the source states this for an odd prime, but primality is
used there solely to rule out `n = 2`, so odd composite torsion is covered by the same proof.
The `y`-coordinate follows by `isInteger_y_of_equation_of_isInteger_x`. -/

/-- For an **even** `n` with `(n / 2 : R)` squarefree, a point killed by `n` but **not** by `2`
has integral `x`-coordinate.

`ψₙ` vanishes at the point, and for even `n` it is `preΨₙ * ψ₂`; the second factor vanishing
would make the point two-torsion, which `h2ne` excludes, so the first vanishes, and `preΨₙ` has
leading coefficient `n / 2`. Excluding order two is not a technicality — a two-torsion point need
not be integral at all, and `den_dvd_four_of_order_two` is everything that survives there.

`h2` is needed on top of `hsf`: it is `n / 2` that is squarefree, and `(n : R) = 2 * (n / 2 : R)`
is what the leading-coefficient formula asks to be nonzero. The `y`-coordinate follows by
