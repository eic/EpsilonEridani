# Torsion points over an algebraically closed field are already rational

Over an algebraically closed `F`, a torsion point of `W` with coordinates in an extension `Ω` has
its coordinates in `F`: the extension buys no new torsion. No condition on the index is needed,
because an algebraically closed field also extracts the inseparable roots that a torsion point of
an index divisible by the characteristic has; the companion statements over a merely separably
closed field ask for an invertible index in exchange.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.mem_range_x_of_zsmul_eq_zero_of_isAlgClosed`: over an algebraically closed
  `F`, the `x`-coordinate of an `n`-torsion point of `W` over an extension lies in the image
  of `F`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.mem_range_baseChange_of_zsmul_eq_zero_of_isAlgClosed`: such an `n`-torsion
  point is therefore the base change of one over `F`.

/-- **A torsion point over an extension of an algebraically closed field is already rational.**
No field extension of an algebraically closed `F` buys new torsion: the coordinates of a torsion
point are integral over `F`, hence already in it. So the `n`-torsion of `W` over `Ω` is the base
change of the `n`-torsion over `F`, for every extension `Ω` and not only an algebraic one. -/
