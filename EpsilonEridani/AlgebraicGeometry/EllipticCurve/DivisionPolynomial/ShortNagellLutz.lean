# The Nagell–Lutz theorem for a short Weierstrass model

For `A B : ℤ`, a nonzero rational point of finite order on `y² = x³ + Ax + B` has **integral**
coordinates, and its `y`-coordinate satisfies `y = 0` or `y² ∣ Δ`. That is the classical
statement, and unlike the long-model theorem it has no order-two exception.

The exception disappears for a computable reason rather than by assumption. On a short model
`a₁ = a₃ = 0`, so `ψ₂ = 2y`; a point of order two makes `ψ₂` vanish, hence `y = 0`, and then the
curve equation exhibits `x` as a rational root of the **monic** `X³ + AX + B`, so `x` is an
integer too. The long model's honest bound `4x, 8y ∈ ℤ` therefore sharpens to full integrality
exactly here.

The same collapse turns the discriminant companion into its classical form: it gives
`ψ₂ = 0 ∨ ψ₂² ∣ 4Δ`, and substituting `ψ₂ = 2y₀` yields `2y₀ = 0 ∨ 4y₀² ∣ 4Δ`, from which the `4`
cancels on both sides.

**No `Δ ≠ 0` hypothesis.** The source carries one on all three of its headline theorems and uses
it in none of them; what the argument needs is that the *point* is nonsingular, not that the curve
is elliptic. See the Provenance note.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.lutz_nagell`: the theorem at the roadmap's explicit short model
  `y² = x³ + Ax + B` — integral coordinates together with `y₀ = 0 ∨ y₀² ∣ Δ`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isInteger_of_torsion`: the integrality half, with no order-two exception, for
  any integral model in characteristic-≠-2 normal form.
* `WeierstrassCurve.y_eq_zero_or_sq_dvd_Δ_of_torsion`: the discriminant half, likewise.

The three results above `lutz_nagell` are stated at `[W.IsCharNeTwoNF]`, i.e. `a₁ = a₃ = 0`, not
at `shortCurve`: no step uses `a₂ = 0`, and the cubic `X³ + a₂X² + a₄X + a₆` is monic either way.
`lutz_nagell` is their specialisation, and costs nothing to obtain — Mathlib's
`isCharNeTwoNF_of_isShortNF` supplies the instance.

## Roadmap

New mathematics: `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:821` — "**The torsion subgroup and
Nagell–Lutz**". Lines `:828`–`:830` name this target: for an integral **short** model
`y² = x³ + Ax + B`, "the classical full form — `x, y ∈ ℤ` and `y = 0` or `y² ∣ Δ`
(`lutz_nagell`; AEC VIII.7)".

## Provenance

Ported from AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0,
`main @ 1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`), from two files whose authorship differs and is
credited separately.

**`LutzNagellTheorem/Main.lean` — `Authors: Chris Birkbeck`.** All three headline theorems come
from it: `lutz_nagell_integrality` (`:40`), `lutz_nagell_discriminant` (`:53`) and `lutz_nagell`
(`:71`). That file carries its own author header, so it is credited to Chris Birkbeck rather than
to the project's usual pair, and the header of this file names them accordingly.

**`LutzNagellTheorem/GeneralMain.lean` — no author header.** Its
`lutz_nagell_integrality_short` (`:155`) is where the order-two collapse is carried out; with no
header to go on it is credited to the project, as the sibling ports in this chain are.

**The `Δ ≠ 0` hypothesis is dropped.** All three source theorems take
`hΔ : (shortCurveZ A B).Δ ≠ 0`; none uses it. It occurs in the three signatures and twice in the
bodies, both times in `lutz_nagell` forwarding it to the two theorems whose proofs never mention
it — a pass-through of a hypothesis nothing consumes, which this repository's `unusedArguments`
linter would reject in any case.

One further adaptation: `ψ₂ = 2y` is stated over an arbitrary commutative ring, since the point
lives over `ℚ` while the conclusion is over `ℤ` and both need it. The monic-root step follows the
source and goes through `isInteger_of_is_root_of_monic` — Mathlib's, which is what the source's
own lemma of that name restates.

integral model in characteristic-≠-2 normal form, either `y₀ = 0` or `y₀²` divides the
discriminant.

The general companion gives `ψ₂ = 0 ∨ ψ₂² ∣ 4Δ`; here `ψ₂ = 2y₀`, so the first disjunct is
`2y₀ = 0` and the second is `4y₀² ∣ 4Δ`, and the `4` cancels on both sides. -/

/-- **Nagell–Lutz, integrality half.** On an integral model in characteristic-≠-2 normal form a
nonzero torsion point has integral coordinates — with *no* order-two exception.

The long-model theorem leaves order two aside with only `4x, 8y ∈ ℤ`. Here that case collapses:
`ψ₂ = 2y`, so order two forces `y = 0`, and the curve equation then exhibits `x` as a rational root
of the monic `X³ + a₂X² + a₄X + a₆`. The `a₂` term costs nothing — the cubic is monic either
way. -/

/-- **The Nagell–Lutz theorem.** Let `A B : ℤ` and let `(x, y)` be a nonzero rational point of
finite order on `y² = x³ + Ax + B`. Then `x` and `y` are integers, and either `y = 0` or
`y² ∣ Δ`.

This is the classical statement, and the form `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:830` names
`lutz_nagell`. It is the specialisation of the two theorems above at a short model: Mathlib's
`isCharNeTwoNF_of_isShortNF` supplies the instance, so there is nothing to discharge. No hypothesis
`Δ ≠ 0` is needed — see the module docstring. -/
