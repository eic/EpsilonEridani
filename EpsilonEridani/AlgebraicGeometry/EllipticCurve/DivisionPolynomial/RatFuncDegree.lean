# The degree of the rational function `Φₙ / ΨSqₙ`

`Coprimality.lean` shows that `Φₙ` and `ΨSqₙ` are coprime on a nonsingular curve, so for `n ≠ 0`
the quotient `Φₙ / ΨSqₙ` is already in lowest terms. This file draws the consequence: it has
**degree `n²`**, in the sense that adjoining it to `F` inside `F(x)` leaves an extension of
dimension `n²`.

For `n ≠ 0` that quotient is the `x`-coordinate of `n • (x, y)`, so the theorem says the
`x`-coordinate map of `[n]` is a rational map of degree `n²`. At `n = 0` it is not a coordinate of
anything — `[0]` sends every point to infinity, and `ΨSq₀ = 0` makes the quotient the junk value
`0` — but the theorem still holds there, as an equality of two zeros; see its docstring.

This is the arithmetic half of `deg [n] = n²` (Silverman III.6.4(a), proved in III.6.2(d)).
The other half is the tower
`F(x, y)` over `F(x)`, which is quadratic on both storeys and therefore cancels; neither that nor
the isogeny `[n]` itself appears here.

## Main results

/-- **`Φₙ / ΨSqₙ` has degree `n²`**: adjoining it to `F` inside the rational function field
leaves an extension of dimension `n²`. For `n ≠ 0` this is the statement that the `x`-coordinate
map of `[n]` is a rational map of degree `n²` — the arithmetic half of `deg [n] = n²`.

Nonsingularity is assumed only where it is used. At `n = 0` the quotient is not a coordinate of
anything — `[0]` sends every point to infinity, and `ΨSq₀` vanishes, making the quotient the junk
value `0` — and the equality holds there for a singular `W` too, as one between two zeros: `F⟮0⟯`
is `⊥` and `F(x)` is not finite-dimensional over `F`, so the `finrank` is `0` by convention, while
`(0 : ℤ).natAbs ^ 2` is `0` as well. `EpsilonEridani.RatFunc.finrank_adjoin_X_pow` reads the same way at
`n = 0`, for the same reason. -/
