# The division polynomial `ψ` as a normalised EDS

Mathlib defines `WeierstrassCurve.ψ` as `normEDS` at the curve's division-polynomial parameters,
but keeps the body unexposed, so no importing module can see the identification by unfolding.
This file states it, at the level of functions, and draws the one consequence that needs nothing
else: the `ψ` family is an elliptic **net**. The elliptic-sequence reading is the last index held
at `0`, available as `.isEllipticSequence`.

These two facts depend only on Mathlib's `DivisionPolynomial/Basic.lean` and this repository's
`EllipticDivisibilitySequence/NormEDS.lean`, so they sit at exactly that level — below both the
`ω` development (`DivisionPolynomial/Omega.lean`, whose `ω_spec` rewrites through the function
form) and the universal-curve transports (`DivisionPolynomial/Universal.lean`, whose elliptic
sequence statement over `Universal.Field` factors through the same identification).

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.ψ_eq_normEDS`: `W.ψ = normEDS W.ψ₂ (C W.Ψ₃) (C W.preΨ₄)`, as functions.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isEllipticNet_ψ`: the `ψ` family is an elliptic net.

## Provenance

`isEllipticNet_ψ` adapts J. Xu and D. K. Angdinata's
`LutzNagell/DivisionPolynomialOmega.lean` in AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`,
Apache-2.0, `main @ 1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`), declaration `isEllSequence_ψ`.
It is **strengthened rather than transcribed**: the source states the `s = 0` shift, and the net
holds by the identical one-line route through `isEllipticNet_normEDS`, so the weaker form was
never the cheaper one. The sequence form is not kept alongside because it had **no consumer** —
`IsEllipticNet.isEllipticSequence` recovers it for any future one. (The addition formula at
`ZSMul.lean:191` does consume a sequence form, but the *universal* one,
`Universal.isEllipticSequence_polyToField_ψ`, which is a different declaration and untouched
here.) Stating the net is the same call `DivisionPolynomial/Universal.lean` already made on the
source's `isEllSequence_ψᵤ`. That file's header reads
`Authors: Junyan Xu, David Kurniadi Angdinata`; following this repository's convention for
adapted material the upstream authorship is credited here rather than in the copyright header.
`ψ_eq_normEDS` has no source counterpart: the source unfolds `ψ` where it needs this, which the
module system rejects across file boundaries, so the identification is a named `rfl` here.
