# The omega family of division polynomials

`ω n` is the bivariate polynomial that the scalar-multiplication development identifies as the
second (Jacobian) coordinate of multiplication by `n` on a Weierstrass curve — that
identification belongs there, not here, and is not yet in the library. This file supplies the
polynomial itself, completing the `(φ, ψ)` pair of Mathlib's division-polynomial API: it defines
`ω` and the 2-complement `ψc` of `ψ`, and proves the defining identity

`2 ω n + a₁ φ n ψ n + a₃ (ψ n)³ = ψc n`,

which pins down `2 ω n` in general and `ω` itself wherever `2` is a nonzerodivisor — the
equation lemma `ω_def` is the unconditional handle. Alongside: the value lemmas `ω_zero` and
`ω_one`, the parity rules `ω_neg` and `ψc_neg`, the complement identity `ψ n * ψc n = ψ (2n)`,
and naturality in the coefficient ring for both families.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.ψc`: the complement of `ψ n` in `ψ (2n)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.ω`: the `ω` family of division polynomials.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.ω_spec`: `2 ω n + a₁ φ n ψ n + a₃ (ψ n)³ = ψc n`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.ω_def`: the defining formula, as an equation lemma — the unexposed body's
  handle for consumers, and the only one that determines `ω` where `2` is a zero divisor.
* `WeierstrassCurve.ψ_mul_ψc`: `ψ n * ψc n = ψ (2n)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.ω_neg`: `ω (-n) = ω n + a₁ φ n ψ n + a₃ (ψ n)³`, proved over the
  universal curve — where `2` is a nonzerodivisor — and specialised.
* `WeierstrassCurve.map_ψc`, `.map_ω`, `.baseChange_ψc`, `.baseChange_ω`: naturality in the
  coefficient ring, in both the ring-hom and the algebra-tower form of the `ψ`/`φ` siblings.

## References

* [J. Silverman, *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*][silverman2009], Exercise 3.7, which defines
  the `(ψ, φ, ω)` triple for a general Weierstrass equation
  `y² + a₁xy + a₃y = x³ + a₂x² + a₄x + a₆` (the short form is offered there only as an optional
  simplification), and whose part (d), `[m]P = (φₘ/ψₘ², ωₘ/ψₘ³)`, is what makes `ω` a
  `Y`-coordinate numerator and fixes the normalisation of `ω` taken here. Part (d) has no Lean
  statement anywhere in this library yet: `DivisionPolynomial/ZSMul.lean` defines `smulY n` as
  `ωₙ/ψₙ³`, but identifying that rational function with the `Y`-coordinate of `n • P` remains to
  be proved.

  The exercise's own recurrence fixes a different normalisation, and the two part company off the
  short form. Its printed `4y ωₘ = ψₘ₋₁² ψₘ₊₂ + ψₘ₋₂ ψₘ₊₁²` is corrected by Silverman's errata
  (the entry `Pages 105-106, Exercise 3.7` of
  `math.brown.edu/johsilve/AEC/AECErrata2013.pdf`) to
  `2 (2y + a₁x + a₃) ωₘ = ψₘ₋₁² ψₘ₊₂ - ψₘ₋₂ ψₘ₊₁²`; as `ψ_mul_ψc` reads that right-hand side as
  `ψ₂ ψcₘ`, and `ψ₂ = 2y + a₁x + a₃`, the corrected recurrence says `2 ωₘ = ψcₘ`, so `ω₁` is
  `(2y + a₁x + a₃)/2`. Part (d) instead forces `ω₁ = y`, which is what `ω_one` records; the two
  normalisations agree exactly when `a₁ = a₃ = 0`. `ω_spec` below is the part-(d) one, its extra
  `a₁ φₘ ψₘ + a₃ ψₘ³` being precisely that discrepancy.

## Provenance

Ported from J. Xu and D. K. Angdinata's `LutzNagell/DivisionPolynomialOmega.lean` in AINTLIB
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, `main` at
`1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`), declarations `ψc`, `ω`, `ω_spec`, `two_mul_ω`,
`ψc_spec` (here `ψ_mul_ψc`, naming its left-hand side), `ω_zero`, `ω_one`, `ψc_neg`,
`map_ω`, `universal_ω_neg` and `ω_neg`. That file's header reads
`Authors: Junyan Xu, David Kurniadi Angdinata`; following this repository's convention for
adapted material the upstream authorship is credited here rather than in the copyright
header. The invariant-polynomial half of that source file is already in
`DivisionPolynomial/Invariant.lean`; this file is the `ω` half, unblocked by
`reducedInvarNum_eq_reducedInvarDenom_mul` (`ReducedInvariant.lean`), the port of the
source's `redInvar_normEDS`. Its `isEllSequence_ψ` is ported separately, in
`DivisionPolynomial/NormEDS.lean`, which needs none of the reduced-invariant theory.

The specification realised here and the well-definedness argument behind `ω_neg` are both
stated in the module docstring of pinned Mathlib's
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/DivisionPolynomial/Basic.lean` (D. K. Angdinata):
`ωₙ := (ψ₂ₙ / ψₙ - ψₙ(a₁φₙ + a₃ψₙ²)) / 2`, with `2` dividing that difference in the
characteristic-zero universal ring and `ωₙ` its image under the universal morphism. This file
discharges that docstring's `TODO: the bivariate polynomials ωₙ`. The remaining declarations
with no source counterpart are the equation lemmas `ψc_def` and `ω_def` (the module system
keeps both bodies unexposed, so each needs a named handle), the value lemmas `ψc_zero`,
`ψc_one` and `ψc_two` (the `complEDS₂` values read at the curve's parameters), `map_ψc`, and
the two `baseChange_*` forms, which follow Mathlib's sibling `baseChange_ψ`/`baseChange_φ`.
