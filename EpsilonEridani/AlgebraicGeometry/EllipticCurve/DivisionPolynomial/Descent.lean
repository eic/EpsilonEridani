# Integrality descends along multiplication by `n`

If `n • P` has integral coordinates then so does `P`. This is the descent step of the
Nagell–Lutz argument: it lets an integrality claim about a torsion point be pulled back from a
multiple where it is easier to establish.

The mechanism is one identity between the two `x`-coordinates. `zsmul_point_eq_smulEval` gives the
Jacobian coordinates of `n • P` as `(φₙ : ωₙ : ψₙ)` evaluated at `P`, and comparing that with the
affine representative of `n • P` yields `x' · ΨSqₙ(x) = Φₙ(x)`. Writing `x'` as `algebraMap R K c`
for the `c : R` its integrality supplies, that exhibits `x` as a root of the **monic** polynomial
`Φₙ − C c · ΨSqₙ` over `R`, so integral closure places `x` in `R`, and the curve equation carries
integrality from `x` to `y`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.smulEval_equiv_of_zsmul`: the division-polynomial triple at `P` represents
  `n • P` in Jacobian coordinates; the two coordinate identities below are read off it.
* `WeierstrassCurve.mul_eval_ΨSq_eq_eval_Φ_of_zsmul`: the coordinate identity
  `x' · ΨSqₙ(x) = Φₙ(x)` relating `P` and `n • P`, over a field.
* `WeierstrassCurve.mul_evalEval_ψ_cube_eq_evalEval_ω_of_zsmul`: its `y`-coordinate companion
  `y' · ψₙ(P)³ = ωₙ(P)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isInteger_of_zsmul_isInteger`: **the descent step.** Over a base `R`
  integrally closed in `K`, if `n • P = P'` and `P'` has integral `x`-coordinate, both
  coordinates of `P` are integral.

## Roadmap

New mathematics: `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:821` — "**The torsion subgroup and
Nagell–Lutz**", route "division polynomials" (`:830`–`:831`). This is the descent half of that
route; it is a prerequisite of the roadmap's stated theorem rather than the theorem itself.

## Provenance

Ported from J. Xu and D. K. Angdinata's
`projects/NagellLutz/LutzNagell/LutzNagellTheorem/PIDIntegralMultiple.lean` in AINTLIB
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, `main @ 1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`):
`x_coord_nsmul_eq` (`:48`) and `isInteger_of_nsmul_isInteger` (`:93`). The file is byte-identical
at `9fec8eba7652`, the revision the roadmap pins for this project (`README:1072`), verified by
blob hash, so the citations hold at either.

The source's intermediate `x_isInteger_of_nsmul_x_isInteger` (`:73`) is **not ported**: it is the
composition of the coordinate identity above with the integral-root argument, and this repository
already carries the latter as `Integral.lean`'s `isInteger_of_mul_eval_ΨSq_eq_eval_Φ` — whose own
docstring notes that "no point, and no multiple, occurs in this statement", i.e. it is exactly the
point-free half. The composition is inlined here rather than given a name.

Three adaptations. `curveK R K W` is `W.map (algebraMap R K)`, which is `rfl`-equal to Mathlib's
`W.baseChange K`; this file uses `baseChange`, matching `Integral.lean` and `Integrality.lean`.
The source's `hn : n ≠ 0`, `hn_R : (n : R) ≠ 0` and `_hy'` hypotheses are dropped — none is used
by the proof once the integral-root step is delegated, and `_hy'` is unused upstream too.

**The base ring is generalised, and `K` need not be its fraction field.** The source assumes a
UFD; no factorisation argument occurs anywhere in these two proofs, so integral closedness alone
suffices, and `[IsDomain R]` turns out to be unnecessary as well — `unusedSectionVars` reported it
once the UFD hypothesis was removed. Integral closedness is then asked for *relative to `K`*, as
`[IsIntegrallyClosedIn R K]`, rather than as `[IsIntegrallyClosed R] [IsFractionRing R K]`: this is
the hypothesis `Integral.lean`'s `isInteger_of_mul_eval_ΨSq_eq_eval_Φ` already takes, and it is
strictly weaker, since the pair implies it (`isIntegrallyClosed_iff_isIntegrallyClosedIn`) but says
more besides. The `y`-coordinate step is then exactly `Integrality.lean`'s
`isInteger_y_of_equation_of_isInteger_x`, which asks for `[IsIntegrallyClosedIn R K]` and nothing
else — the same hypothesis this file already carries, so it applies with no bridging.

`[DecidableEq K]` is **not** removable: `n • P` is `zsmul` for Mathlib's `AddCommGroup W.Point`
instance, which is declared under `[DecidableEq F]` because affine addition is defined by cases.
The instance is needed to *state* both theorems, so a `classical` inside the proofs cannot supply
it.

denominator in the same way. The two identities together pin `n • P` down, which the
`x`-identity alone cannot, because a point and its negative share an `x`-coordinate. The hypothesis
`n • P = (x', y')` forces `ψₙ(P) ≠ 0`, since the two Jacobian representatives differ by a unit
scalar acting on the `Z`-coordinate. -/
