# The addition series presented over `Fin 2`

`formalAdd` is indexed by `Unit ⊕ Unit`, one variable per chord parameter, which is the shape every
series-level lemma about it is stated in. Mathlib's `FormalGroup`, by contrast, carries a power
series in `MvPowerSeries (Fin 2) R`. This file transports the two linear coefficients along the
reindexing `unitSumUnitEquivFinTwo`.

Those two are the `lin_coeff_X` and `lin_coeff_Y` fields of the `FormalGroup` structure built by
`WeierstrassCurve.formalGroup`. The constant coefficient is discharged directly by `simp`, while
associativity is transported at the construction site by the general
`MvPowerSeries.rename_unitSumUnitEquivFinTwo_assoc` theorem.

`formalAdd` over `Unit ⊕ Unit` stays the working object: nothing here re-founds it over `Fin 2`,
and the `Fin 2` presentation is not a second public spelling of the addition series — it exists to
be the `toPowerSeries` field of that structure.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.coeff_single_zero_rename_unitSumUnitEquivFinTwo_formalAdd` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.coeff_single_one_rename_unitSumUnitEquivFinTwo_formalAdd`:
  the two linear coefficients.

## Provenance

No external source. Michael Stoll's development states the group law over `Unit`-indexed sums
throughout and bundles it into his own `FormalGroupLaw` structure, so the reindexing has no
counterpart there; it is the cost of refounding on Mathlib's `FormalGroup`, whose `assoc` field is
stated over `Fin 2`.
