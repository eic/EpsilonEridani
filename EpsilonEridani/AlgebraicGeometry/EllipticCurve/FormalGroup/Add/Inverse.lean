# The inverse law of the chord group law

`FormalGroup/Add/Series.lean` produces `formalAdd`, the series `F(z₁, z₂) = ι(z₃(z₁, z₂))` of the
chord construction, and `FormalGroup/Add/Unit.lean` proves its two unit laws. This file proves the
**inverse law** `F(z, ι(z)) = 0`, where `ι = formalInverse` is the formal inverse.

This is not one of the axioms of `FormalGroup`, which asks only for the constant and linear
coefficients and for associativity; a formal group law has a unique inverse series regardless.
What the identity says is that the series produced from the curve's negation is that inverse, so
the geometric `ι` and the abstract one agree.

Geometrically the chord through a point `P` and its negative `-P` is the vertical line through
them, which meets the curve again at the point at infinity; so the third root `z₃(z, ι(z))`
vanishes, and `F(z, ι(z)) = ι(z₃(z, ι(z))) = ι(0) = 0`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.subst_invPair_formalThirdRoot`: the third root of the chord through a point
  and its formal inverse vanishes, `z₃(z, ι(z)) = 0`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.subst_invPair_formalAdd`: the **inverse law** `F(z, ι(z)) = 0`.

## Implementation notes

Both results hold over an arbitrary commutative ring, but the chord argument does not prove them
there: it divides by `ι - z`, so it needs `O` to be a domain, and it reaches `2 = 0` in the branch
it has to rule out. Both hypotheses are met by `ℤ[A₁, ⋯, A₆]`, so the argument runs over the
universal curve, and `map_specialize` then carries the conclusion to every `W` — the descent
`DivisionPolynomial/Omega.lean` also runs. The nondegeneracy `ι ≠ z` is not a further hypothesis:
it follows from `2 ≠ 0` by comparing linear coefficients.

The pair `(z, ι(z))` enters as the substituted family `Sum.elim X (fun _ ↦ formalInverse W)`,
written inline throughout, as `Add/Unit.lean` writes its own two families inline: naming it would
add a definition whose unfolding lemma every proof would carry. `FormalGroup/PairEval.lean` writes
the same family inline for the same reason when it transports `subst_invPair_formalAdd` through
evaluation, but takes `hasSubst_invPair` from here rather than rebuilding it — that witness is
exported for exactly this transport, because `MvPowerSeries.aeval_subst` needs a `HasSubst` for
the very family the two public `subst_invPair_*` results are stated about.

The source's `addSeries`, `thirdRootSeries`, `slopeSeries`, `interceptSeries`, `inverseSeries`,
`uSeries` and `wSeries` are `formalAdd`, `formalThirdRoot`, `formalSlope`, `formalIntercept`,
`formalInverse`, `formalInverseDenom` and `formalW` here, continuing the renaming this repository
applies to the rest of that development.

`FormalGroup/Add/PairSubst.lean` proves the chord identities for an arbitrary pair `(q₁, q₂)` of
series with vanishing constant coefficient; this module specializes them to the pair `(z, ι(z))`,
which is the case the formal inverse law needs.

The source's `subst_wSeries_ne_zero` is `subst_formalW_ne_zero` in `FormalGroup/Add/Assoc.lean`;
its `interceptSeries_ne_zero` and `X_pair_intercept_ne_zero` have no counterpart in this
repository.

identities in. `Sum.elim X` and `Sum.elim (fun _ ↦ X ())` are the same family — `Unit` has one
