# The addition series of a Weierstrass curve

`FormalGroup/Chord.lean` produces `formalThirdRoot`, the parameter of the third point in which
the chord through the points with parameters `z₁` and `z₂` meets the curve, and
`FormalGroup/Inverse.lean` produces `formalInverse`, the parameter of the negative of a point.
The group law is the composite: the sum of two points is the *negative* of the third point of
their chord, so its parameter is

`F(z₁, z₂) = ι(z₃(z₁, z₂))`.

That series is `formalAdd`, and it is the series underlying the elliptic formal group law.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.formalAdd`: the addition series `F(z₁, z₂)` of `W`, in `R⟦z₁, z₂⟧`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.constantCoeff_formalAdd`: `F(0, 0) = 0`, so `F` may itself be substituted
  into a power series, which every later statement about the group law needs. Mathlib's
  `FormalGroup` carries this as its `zero_constantCoeff` field.
* `WeierstrassCurve.rename_swap_formalAdd`: `F(z₂, z₁) = F(z₁, z₂)`. The chord does not depend
  on the order of its two points, so the group law is commutative.
* `WeierstrassCurve.map_formalAdd`: `F` commutes with base change along a ring homomorphism,
  completing the base-change block that `Chord.lean` and `Inverse.lean` already carry for the
  two series `F` is built from.

## Implementation notes

`formalAdd` is a substitution of the two-variable `formalThirdRoot` into the one-variable
`formalInverse`, so it lands in `MvPowerSeries (Unit ⊕ Unit) R` — the indexing `Chord.lean`
uses. Mathlib's `RingTheory/FormalGroup` indexes by `Fin 2` instead; the bridge between the two
belongs with the `FormalGroup` instance itself and is deliberately not built here, so that this
file stays a statement about the chord construction.

The commutativity proof reassociates the substitution rather than computing coefficients:
renaming along `Sum.swap` commutes past the outer substitution, and what is left is the
swap-invariance of `formalThirdRoot` already proved in `Chord.lean`.

The source's `addSeries` is named `formalAdd` here, continuing the renaming this repository

`interceptSeries`, `thirdRootSeries` and `inverseSeries` are `formalW`, `formalU`,
`formalSlope`, `formalIntercept`, `formalThirdRoot` and `formalInverse`. `formalAdd` pairs with
`formalInverse` as the two operations of the formal group.
