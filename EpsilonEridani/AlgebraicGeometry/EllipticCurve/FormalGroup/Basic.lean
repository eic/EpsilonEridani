# The formal group law of a Weierstrass curve

The chord construction at the point at infinity gives an addition series `formalAdd W`. This file
packages that series as Mathlib's one-dimensional `FormalGroup`: the two variables are reindexed
from the named sum `Unit ⊕ Unit` to `Fin 2`, and the previously established constant, linear, and
associativity identities supply the structure fields.

The resulting formal group is commutative because the chord addition series is symmetric. Thus
Mathlib's `FormalGroup.Point` construction gives an additive commutative monoid of
power-series-valued points whose constant coefficient is nilpotent.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.formalGroup`: the one-dimensional formal group law attached to a Weierstrass
  curve.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.isComm_formalGroup`: the elliptic formal group law is commutative.
* `WeierstrassCurve.map_formalGroup`: the construction commutes with base change.

## References

* [J. Silverman, *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*][silverman2009], IV.1.

## Provenance

The addition series and its laws are adapted in the imported modules from Michael Stoll's
`EllipticCurves` project (`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, Apache-2.0) at commit
`66889eada51a74c2f5dfb7fb5909b0b5a0a2d96e`. The packaging here is original: that source uses its
own formal-group-law structure, whereas this development refounds the construction on Mathlib's
`RingTheory/FormalGroup` API.
