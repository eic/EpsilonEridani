# Points of a Weierstrass curve from formal-group parameters

Over a complete ring `O` carrying the `I`-adic topology, a parameter `t ∈ I` gives a point of
`W` over any field `K` whose structure map `O → K` is injective: the `w`-expansion converges at
`t`, and the pair
`(t / w(t), -1 / w(t))` satisfies the Weierstrass equation because the `w`-equation *is* that
equation read in the coordinates `x = t / w`, `y = -1 / w`. The parameter `t = 0` gives the point
at infinity.

`equation_formalPoint` needs nothing beyond that: the pair lies on the curve for any `W`. Turning
it into a *point* does need the curve over `K` to be elliptic, so everything from `formalPoint`
onwards assumes `[(W.baseChange K).IsElliptic]` — weaker than asking `W` itself to be elliptic
over `O`, which would exclude an integral model whose discriminant is nonzero but not a unit.

The two coordinates are recorded in closed form as well. Since `w(t) = t ^ 3 * u(t)` with `u(t)`
a unit, the `x`-coordinate is inverse to `t ^ 2 * u(t)` and the `y`-coordinate to
`-(t ^ 3 * u(t))`. Both are stated as products in `K`, so no inverse of either factor has to be
named; the powers `2` and `3` of `t` they exhibit are what a valuation on `K` would later turn
into pole orders, but no order or valuation hypothesis is assumed here.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.formalPoint`: the point of `W⁄K` attached to a parameter of an adic ideal.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.equation_formalPoint`: the parametrized pair lies on the curve.
* `WeierstrassCurve.formalPoint_eq_some`: a point both of whose ratios `-x / y` and `-1 / y` come
  from the ideal is the parametrised point of the first, the surjectivity companion of
  `WeierstrassCurve.formalPoint_injective`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.neg_xCoord_div_yCoord_formalPoint`: the parameter read back off the point as
  `-x / y`, and with it `WeierstrassCurve.formalPoint_eq_zero_iff` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.formalPoint_injective`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.formalPoint_of_param_eq_zero` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.formalPoint_of_param_ne_zero`: the two branches of the definition.
* `WeierstrassCurve.formalPoint_formalInverseEval`: **the parametrisation respects negation** —
  the formal inverse on parameters becomes the group inverse on points, which on a generalised
  Weierstrass curve sends `y` to `-y - a₁x - a₃` rather than to `-y`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.xRep_formalPoint_eq_iff`: two parameters have points with the same
  `x`-coordinate exactly when they are equal or exchanged by the formal inverse, with
  `WeierstrassCurve.mul_formalWEval_eq_mul_formalWEval_iff` its chord form.
* `WeierstrassCurve.xCoord_formalPoint` and `WeierstrassCurve.yCoord_formalPoint`: the point's
  coordinates, through which the closed forms
  `WeierstrassCurve.xCoord_formalPoint_mul_eq_one` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.yCoord_formalPoint_mul_eq_neg_one` are stated.

## Provenance

The same parametrization is formalised in Michael Stoll's elliptic-curve development
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves` @ `66889eada51a`, Apache-2.0), file
`EllipticCurves/WeierstrassFormalGroup/Filtration.lean`, declarations `formalPoint`,
`formalPoint_of_param_eq_zero`, `formalPoint_of_param_ne_zero`, `formalPoint_nonsingular` and
`formalPoint_negPoint`. The first three keep their source names; the fourth is not restated,
`Affine.Point.mk` carrying the equation-to-nonsingularity step itself.

`formalPoint_formalInverseEval` is that source's `formalPoint_negPoint`. It is what makes the
parameters of an adic ideal closed under inverses as *points*, so that the chord case of
additivity in `Point/Add.lean` can read the addition series as a negated third root. Its name
takes this repository's vocabulary, `formalInverseEval` rather than the source's `negPoint`,
since the object being applied is the evaluated formal inverse.

`mul_formalWEval_eq_mul_formalWEval_iff` is that source's `eq_or_eq_negPoint_of_x_cond`, private
there and stated in one direction only; `xRep_formalPoint_eq_iff` is the form on `xRep` that it
specialises.

That development states them over `v.adicCompletion K` for a height-one prime of a Dedekind domain
and builds nonsingularity from a chord lemma of its own. The declarations below are stated over an
arbitrary complete adic ring mapping injectively to a field, and read the nonsingularity off
Mathlib's `equation_iff_nonsingular`, which `Affine.Point.mk` also uses.

The two ratios are asked for as products, `t * y = -x` and `s * y = -1`, so that no division is
