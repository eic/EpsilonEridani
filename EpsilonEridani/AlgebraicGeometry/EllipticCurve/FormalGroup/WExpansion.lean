# The `w`-expansion of a Weierstrass curve

Substituting `x = z / w` and `y = -1 / w` into the Weierstrass equation of `W` and clearing
denominators turns it into

`w = z ^ 3 + a₁ z w + a₂ z ^ 2 w + a₃ w ^ 2 + a₄ z w ^ 2 + a₆ w ^ 3`,

which determines a unique power series `w(z) ∈ R⟦z⟧` with no terms below `z ^ 3`. This file
constructs that series, proves it satisfies the equation, and proves it is the only series with
vanishing constant coefficient that does.

The equation is also recorded with its parameter left free, as `WeierstrassCurve.wEquationRHS`,
and its solution shown unique at every parameter with vanishing constant coefficient: the formal
group obtains the inverse and the group law by substitution, and a substituted series solves the
equation at the substituted parameter rather than at `z`.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.formalWCoeff`: the coefficients of `w(z)`, by strong recursion.
* `WeierstrassCurve.formalW`: the series `w(z)` itself.
* `WeierstrassCurve.formalUCoeff`, `WeierstrassCurve.formalU`: the coefficients, and the series
  itself, of `u(z) = w(z) / z ^ 3`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.wEquationRHS`: the right-hand side of the displayed equation, with both the
  parameter and the unknown left free.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.formalW_wEquation`: **Silverman AEC IV.1.1(a), existence** — `w(z)`
  satisfies the displayed equation, as an identity of power series.
* `WeierstrassCurve.eq_formalW_of_wEquation`: **Silverman AEC IV.1.1(a), uniqueness** — any
  power series with vanishing constant coefficient satisfying that equation equals `w(z)`. The
  two together are the full statement, that `w(z)` is *the* such series.
* `WeierstrassCurve.eq_of_wEquation`: uniqueness at any parameter that itself has vanishing
  constant coefficient — two series with vanishing constant coefficient solving the equation at
  that parameter are equal.
* `WeierstrassCurve.eq_of_wEquation_mvPowerSeries`: that same uniqueness one index type up, for
  series in `MvPowerSeries σ S` over any `R`-algebra `S` — so it survives scalar extension. It is
  a sibling of `eq_of_wEquation` and not a generalisation of it: filtering by total degree needs
  subtraction, so this one asks for `[CommRing S]` on the *coefficient algebra*. The curve's base
  ring `R` is a `CommSemiring` for both.
* `WeierstrassCurve.algebraMap_wEquationRHS`: the equation's right-hand side commutes with an
  algebra map, so a solution over a ring is a solution over any algebra over it.
* `WeierstrassCurve.wEquation_of_equation`: the `w`-equation is the Weierstrass equation in the
  coordinates `z = -x / y`, `w = -1 / y`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.subst_wEquationRHS` and `WeierstrassCurve.subst_formalW_wEquation`:
  substituting a series `q` into the equation gives the equation at `q`, so `w(q)` solves it
  there. When moreover `constantCoeff q = 0`, `eq_subst_formalW_of_wEquation` combines this with
  `eq_of_wEquation` to identify `w(q)` as the only such solution.
* `WeierstrassCurve.formalWCoeff_recurrence`: the coefficientwise recurrence — each coefficient
  of `w(z)` above the leading one, from the strictly earlier ones. This is the form to compute
  with; the strong recursion behind `formalWCoeff` is an implementation detail.
* `WeierstrassCurve.formalWCoeff_zero`, `_one`, `_two`, `_three` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.formalWCoeff_eq_zero_of_lt`: the series begins `w(z) = z ^ 3 + ⋯`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.formalW_eq_X_pow_mul_formalU`: `w(z) = z ^ 3 * u(z)`, where
  `WeierstrassCurve.constantCoeff_formalU` gives `u(0) = 1`. Over a `CommRing` that makes `u(z)`
  a unit; at the `CommSemiring` generality of that section it does not.

## Scope

This is the `w`-expansion only, the foundation of the formal group of `W`; the group law
`F(z₁, z₂)` is not here. Mathlib's `FormalGroup` (`Mathlib/RingTheory/FormalGroup/Basic.lean`)
bundles an associativity proof, and associativity of the Weierstrass group law is a separate
theorem of real depth, so a `FormalGroup` term cannot be produced from the `w`-expansion alone.
The directory anticipates that later work.

## Provenance

Adapted from the AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, pinned
by `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` at `dev/hasse-weil @ 513e83879e2f`),
`HasseWeil/FormalGroup.lean`, declarations `formalW_step`, `formalW_coeff`, `formalW`,
`formalU_coeff`, the `formalW_coeff_*` lemmas and `formalW_recurrence`.

The statement of uniqueness at an arbitrary parameter is adapted from Michael Stoll's
`EllipticCurves` project (`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, Apache-2.0, pinned by
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` at `66889eada51a`),
`EllipticCurves/WeierstrassFormalGroup/Chord.lean`, declarations `wStepAt` and
`eq_of_wStepAt_fixed`. There the equation is a `def` used only internally; here it is the public
`wEquationRHS`, so the existing statements in this file are phrased through it too. The univariate
proof is not Stoll's: that argues by contraction for the `z`-adic filtration, which needs
subtraction, whereas the coefficient induction used for `eq_of_wEquation` works at the
`CommSemiring` generality of everything in this file except the substitution lemmas, which are
`CommRing` only because Mathlib's `PowerSeries.subst` is.

The multivariate uniqueness statement `eq_of_wEquation_mvPowerSeries` does take Stoll's
contraction route, adapted from the same project's
`EllipticCurves/WeierstrassFormalGroup/ThirdPoint.lean`, declarations `mvWStepAt` and
`eq_of_mvWStepAt_fixed`. Two things there are deliberately not ported. Stoll's `mvWStepAt` is a
second copy of the equation; `wEquationRHS` is stated over an arbitrary `R`-algebra, so reading it
in `MvPowerSeries σ R` already *is* that definition. And Stoll's filtration is carried by a private
predicate `LowVanish k f`, "every coefficient of total degree below `k` vanishes" — that is
Mathlib's `MvPowerSeries.order`, so the estimates here are stated as `(k : ℕ∞) ≤ f.order` and the
predicate and its nine lemmas are not ported either.

Changes from the AINTLIB source. Its convolution helpers `conv₂` and `conv₃`, and its
coefficient and truncation lemmas for them, are stated only for `formalW`, although none of
those proofs uses anything about that series. Generalised to an arbitrary series — and to a
`Semiring`, which is all they need — they are not elliptic-curve material at all, and live in
`EpsilonEridani.RingTheory.PowerSeries.SelfConvolution`, which this file imports and which carries
their attribution.

The AINTLIB source works over a commutative ring. Nothing there needs additive inverses — the
equation, the recursion and both halves of IV.1.1(a) use only sums and products — so everything
here is stated over a `CommSemiring`, with the single exception of the substitution lemmas, which
need Mathlib's `PowerSeries.subst` and so a `CommRing`.

The AINTLIB source does **not** prove uniqueness: its closing note records that the factoring
step is blocked by a `PowerSeries` typeclass gap (`RightDistribClass` and `IsRightCancelAdd`
failing to synthesize), and names coefficient induction as the untried alternative. That is the
route `eq_formalW_of_wEquation` takes here. Stoll's project does prove uniqueness, by the
contraction route recorded above rather than by the coefficient induction used here for the
univariate statement.

The AINTLIB source's own generic formal-group scaffolding (`FormalGroupLaw`,
`bmul`, `binv`, `bpow`, `bcomp`) is deliberately not ported: it predates and duplicates Mathlib's
`Mathlib/RingTheory/FormalGroup/Basic.lean`.

/-- The right-hand side of the `w`-equation, with the parameter series `q` in place of `z` and
the unknown `v` in place of `w`:

`q ^ 3 + a₁ q v + a₂ q ^ 2 v + a₃ v ^ 2 + a₄ q v ^ 2 + a₆ v ^ 3`.

The `w`-expansion is the solution at the parameter `q = z`, but the formal group needs solutions
at other parameters — substituting a series into `w(z)` solves the equation at that series — so
the parameter is left free. Every occurrence of the unknown is multiplied by `q` or sits in a
square or a cube, which is what makes the solution unique (`eq_of_wEquation`).

/-! ### Uniqueness at a parameter with vanishing constant coefficient

The formal group needs uniqueness not only at the parameter `z` but at any parameter series
with vanishing constant coefficient, because the inverse and the group law are obtained by
substituting one series into another, and such a substitution solves the equation at the
substituted parameter rather than at `z`. Vanishing of the constant coefficient is exactly what
makes the equation determine its solution: it is what forces the `n`-th coefficient of the
right-hand side to depend only on the earlier coefficients of the unknown.
-/

/-- The `n`-th coefficient of the right-hand side of the `w`-equation depends only on the
coefficients of the unknown strictly below `n`. This is the whole content of uniqueness: every
occurrence of the unknown is multiplied by the parameter, which has vanishing constant
coefficient, or sits in a square or a cube of a series with vanishing constant coefficient. -/

/-! ### Uniqueness over a multivariate power series ring

`eq_of_wEquation` argues by strong induction on the coefficient index, which needs that index to be
linearly ordered. Over `MvPowerSeries σ S` no such order is available, so the induction runs on the
total degree instead: `MvPowerSeries.order` is exactly the filtration by total degree, and the
right-hand side of the `w`-equation is a contraction for it. That argument needs additive inverses
in the *coefficient algebra* `S`, and only there, which is why `[CommRing S]` appears below while
the curve's base ring `R` stays a `CommSemiring`; the two uniqueness statements are siblings and
neither subsumes the other.

/-- **The right-hand side of the `w`-equation is a contraction for the total-degree filtration.**
If two candidate solutions agree below total degree `k`, then the values of the equation at them
agree below total degree `k + 1`. Every occurrence of the unknown is multiplied by the parameter,
which has positive order, or sits in a square or a cube of a series of positive order, and that is
where the extra degree comes from. -/

/-- **Uniqueness of the solution of the `w`-equation over a multivariate power series ring.** Two
series with vanishing constant coefficient that satisfy the `w`-equation at the same parameter `q`
are equal, provided `q` too has vanishing constant coefficient.

The coefficients are taken in an arbitrary `R`-algebra `S`, matching `wEquationRHS` itself and the
substitution lemmas, so the statement survives scalar extension of the curve's base ring.

This is `eq_of_wEquation` one index type up. It is not a generalisation of it: the argument here
subtracts, so it needs `[CommRing S]` on the coefficient algebra, whereas the univariate statement
needs no inverses at all. The base ring `R` is a `CommSemiring` in both.

/-! ### Substituting into the equation

Substituting a series into the `w`-equation gives the equation at the substituted parameters. The
`w`-equation makes sense in any commutative `R`-algebra, and substitution is an `R`-algebra map, so
this is just the statement that `wEquationRHS` is built from `+`, `*`, `^` and the structure map.

With `constantCoeff q = 0` — strictly stronger than `PowerSeries.HasSubst q`, which asks only that
the constant coefficient be nilpotent — this combines with `eq_of_wEquation` to identify the
substituted solution, which is `eq_subst_formalW_of_wEquation`.

Mathlib's `PowerSeries.subst` is defined only over a `CommRing`, so this section is stated there;
everything above needs no such hypothesis and keeps the `CommSemiring` of the rest of this file.

variable {R : Type*} [CommRing R] (W : WeierstrassCurve R)

/-- Substitution passes through the `w`-equation, carrying both the parameter and the unknown with
it. Both sides are read in the target algebra, which is why `wEquationRHS` is stated for an
arbitrary `R`-algebra: substituting a one-variable series into it lands in `MvPowerSeries τ S`. -/

/-- **The substituted `w`-expansion is the unique solution at the substituted parameter.** For a
parameter `q` with vanishing constant coefficient, any series with vanishing constant coefficient
solving the `w`-equation at `q` is `w(q)`.

This is the composite the formal group consumes: `subst_formalW_wEquation` supplies a solution and
`eq_of_wEquation` says there is only one. Note the hypothesis is `constantCoeff q = 0` rather than
`PowerSeries.HasSubst q`; the latter asks only for a nilpotent constant coefficient, which is not
enough for uniqueness. -/

/-! ### Base change

Every coefficient of the `w`-expansion is a polynomial in `a₁, …, a₆`, so it commutes with base
change along a ring homomorphism. This is what lets an identity between `w`-expansions be proved
once over the universal Weierstrass curve and specialised to any curve.
