# Base change of the étale algebra, and the local condition of `2`-descent

Let `W : y² = f(x) = x³ + a₂x² + a₄x + a₆` be an elliptic curve in characteristic `≠ 2` normal
form over a field `K`, with étale algebra `A = K[X]⧸⟨f⟩` and descent map
`μ : W(K) → M = Aˣ/(Aˣ)²`, as set up in
`EpsilonEridani/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/MordellWeil/XSubT.lean`.

Everything in that construction base-changes along a field extension `L/K` — in the arithmetic
application `L` is a completion of `K`. This file builds that base change and uses it to define
the **local condition** at `L`: the subgroup

`W.localCondition L : Subgroup W.M`

of square classes whose image in `(W⁄L).M` lies in the image of the local descent map `μ_L`. The
`2`-Selmer group of `W` is cut out of `W.M` by these conditions at all completions of `K`, so
`localCondition` is the object every later descent statement is phrased in.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.mapA`: the base-change homomorphism `K[X]⧸⟨f⟩ →+* L[X]⧸⟨f⟩` of étale
  algebras.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.localRes`: the induced map `W.M →* (W⁄L).M` on square classes.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.pointMap`: the base-change homomorphism `W(K) →+ W(L)` on points.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.localCondition`: the local `2`-descent condition at `L`.

## Main statements

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.localRes_μX` and `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.localRes_comp_μ`: the
  descent map is natural under base change — restricting square classes after the global `μ` is
  applying the local `μ` after the base change of points.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.range_μ_le_localCondition`: the image of the global descent map
  satisfies the local condition at every extension field. This is what makes `localCondition` a
  *condition*: it is a constraint the classes coming from `W(K)` are known to satisfy, so the
  intersection of the local conditions bounds `W(K)/2W(K)` from above.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_range_μ_of_surjective_algebraMap`: base change along an
  *isomorphism* preserves the size of the descent image, via
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.range_μ_of_surjective_algebraMap`, which identifies the two images.
  This is the transport step: a count of `#(im μ)` established over a concrete field carries to
  any field isomorphic to it. Its inputs are
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.bijective_mapA_of_surjective_algebraMap` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.localRes_injective_of_surjective_algebraMap`.

## Implementation notes

Square classes are spelled `W.M`, the quotient of `W.Aˣ` by the range of `powMonoidHom 2`,
following `XSubT.lean`; the source uses a local abbreviation `Units.modPow` for the same group,
which is not a Mathlib declaration and which EpsilonEridani deliberately does not carry, so that the
repository has a single spelling of square classes. Accordingly `localRes` is built from
`QuotientGroup.map` rather than from the source's `Units.modPow.map`.

`pointMap` is Mathlib's `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.map` and is not a new construction: the
only content is the alignment of `W` with `W⁄K`, which `baseChange_self` supplies and
Mathlib's `AddEquiv.cast` transports along.

## Provenance

Adapted, with the author's proofs, from Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` project
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, Apache-2.0, pinned by
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` at `66889eada51a`),
`EllipticCurves/SelmerGroup.lean` lines 85-323 — that file's `BaseChange` section: lines 85-295
give the base change up to the local condition and its compatibility with `μ`, and lines 296-323
give the isomorphism-invariance block — `range_μ_of_bijective_algebraMap` and
`card_range_μ_of_bijective_algebraMap` upstream, renamed here for the weaker hypothesis — plus the
étale-algebra bijectivity at line 168.

One declaration is **not** adapted from the source: `localRes_injective_of_surjective_algebraMap`
is re-derived here. The source obtains it from its local `Units.modPow.bijective_map`, which is in
the square-class spelling this repository does not carry, and Mathlib has no `QuotientGroup.map`
injectivity helper to appeal to instead.

This advances `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, Layer 6 (README:813-820), whose
"Explicit `2`-descent (core, this layer)" bullet names "the local conditions" as the first item
to migrate.

### Base change along an isomorphism

If `L/K` is an isomorphism rather than a proper extension, nothing is lost: the étale algebras
are isomorphic, so the descent map has the same image over `L` as over `K`. This is what lets a
count established over a concrete field — `ℝ`, say — be transported to a completion that is
merely isomorphic to it.
