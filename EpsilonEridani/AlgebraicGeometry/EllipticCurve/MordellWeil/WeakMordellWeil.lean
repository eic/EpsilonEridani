# The weak Mordell–Weil theorem: `E(K)/2E(K)` is finite

Let `W : y² = f(x) = x³ + a₂x² + a₄x + a₆` be an elliptic curve in characteristic `≠ 2` normal
form over a field `K`, and let `R` be a Dedekind domain with fraction field `K`. **Step 7**, and
with it the weak Mordell–Weil theorem, is `finiteIndex_range_nsmulAddMonoidHom_two`: the subgroup
`2E(K)` has finite index in `E(K)`.

Everything hard is already done. Step 4 (`ker_μ_eq`) says the kernel of the descent map `μ` is
exactly `2E(K)`, so `E(K)/2E(K)` embeds into the image of `μ`; Step 6
(`range_μ_le_selmerGroupA`) confines that image to `A(S,2)`. All that remains is that `A(S,2)` is
finite, and that is `finite_selmerGroupA`, proved beside `selmerGroupA` itself.

The finiteness hypotheses are carried as instances on the factors: each factor's ring of integers
has finite class group and finitely generated unit group. For `K` a number field these are the
class number theorem and Dirichlet's unit theorem; they are hypotheses here because this file is
about an arbitrary Dedekind domain.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finiteIndex_range_nsmulAddMonoidHom_two_iff`: the criterion — `2E(K)`
  has finite index exactly when the image of `μ` is finite.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finiteIndex_range_nsmulAddMonoidHom_two`: **the weak Mordell–Weil
  theorem.**

## Roadmap

`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, Layer 6 (Mordell–Weil), lines 790–838: Step 7 of the
weak Mordell–Weil theorem. It is the input to the descent argument in the Mordell–Weil theorem
proper.

## Provenance

Adapted, with the author's proofs, from Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` project
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, Apache-2.0, pinned by
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` at `66889eada51a`),
`EllipticCurves/WeakMordellWeil.lean`, the criterion at `:799` and section `Step7`. The source is
written against Lean `v4.32.0`; this is a forward port.

The source proves `A(S,2)` finite by hand, through two `Subgroup` finiteness facts of its own
(`Subgroup.instFinitePi` and `Subgroup.finite_comap_of_injective`) and a per-factor
`finite_selmerGroupFactor`. None of those are needed here: this repository states `selmerGroupA` as
`IsDedekindDomain.selmerGroupOfEquiv`, whose finiteness is already
`IsDedekindDomain.finite_selmerGroupOfEquiv`.
