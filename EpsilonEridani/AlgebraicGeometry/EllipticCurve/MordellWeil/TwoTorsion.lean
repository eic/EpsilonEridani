# The `2`-torsion of the group of points of a Weierstrass curve

Let `W : y² = f(x) = x³ + a₂x² + a₄x + a₆` be an elliptic curve in characteristic `≠ 2` normal
form over a field `K`. In that normal form negation is `-(x, y) = (x, -y)`, so a point is its own
negative exactly when `y = 0`, and the `2`-torsion of `W(K)` is the origin together with the
points `(x, 0)` at the roots of `f`.

The counting statement `card_ker_nsmul_two` is what turns a root count into a torsion count. It
is one side of the archimedean local-image formula of explicit `2`-descent, which reads
`#(im μ_v) = #E(ℝ)[2] / 2` at a real place.

## Main statements

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_ker_nsmul_two`: `#W(K)[2]` is the number of roots of `f` in `K`,
  plus one for the origin.

## Provenance

Adapted, with the author's proofs, from Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` project
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, Apache-2.0, pinned by
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` at `66889eada51a`),
`EllipticCurves/WeakMordellWeil.lean` lines 806-868 — the `2`-torsion section, which sits after
the range that `EpsilonEridani/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/MordellWeil/XSubT.lean` ported.

This advances `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, Layer 6 (README:813-820), whose
"Explicit `2`-descent (core, this layer)" bullet names the local conditions and the rank bound;
the archimedean local-image count needs this torsion count.

/-- **The `2`-torsion of `W(K)` has one more element than `f` has roots in `K`.**

The underlying reason is that the `2`-torsion is the origin together with the points `(x, 0)` at
the roots of `f`; that set equality is established inside the proof, but only the cardinality is
exported, because that is all the archimedean local-image count consumes. A caller needing the
identification itself should ask for it as its own theorem. -/
