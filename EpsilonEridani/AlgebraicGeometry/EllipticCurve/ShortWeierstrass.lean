# The short Weierstrass curve `y² = x³ + Ax + B`

Mathlib carries short Weierstrass form as a *predicate*, `WeierstrassCurve.IsShortNF`, asserting
`a₁ = a₂ = a₃ = 0` of a curve one already has, together with the invariants that follow from it
(`Δ_of_isShortNF`, `j_of_isShortNF`, and the `b`- and `c`-families). What it does not carry is the
*constructor*: the curve built from a chosen pair of coefficients. Statements phrased over an
explicit `y² = x³ + Ax + B` — the classical form of the Nagell–Lutz theorem among them — need that
constructor, so it is supplied here, with the `IsShortNF` instance that connects it to everything
Mathlib already proves.

All five coefficients are stated as `@[simp]` lemmas, in the `Zero` section. They are not
redundant with Mathlib's `a₁_of_isShortNF` family: that family needs the `IsShortNF` instance,
which needs `CommRing`, so at `Zero R` generality it is unavailable and `simp` cannot otherwise
reduce a projection of the opaque constructor. Every other fact about `shortCurve` — the `b`- and
`c`-invariants, `Δ` and `j` — is inherited through the instance rather than restated.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.shortCurve`: the curve `y² = x³ + Ax + B`, over any `Zero`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.instIsShortNFShortCurve`: it is in short normal form, which is what
  makes Mathlib's `*_of_isShortNF` family apply to it.
* `WeierstrassCurve.map_shortCurve`: short form is preserved by a ring hom, and the
  coefficients transport. Mathlib has no `IsShortNF`-under-`map` instance, so this is what lets a
  curve over `ℤ` be base changed to `ℚ` and stay recognisably short.
* `WeierstrassCurve.baseChange_shortCurve`: the same for a base change, which is the spelling
  consumers actually hold. It follows definitionally from `map_shortCurve`, but `simp` does not
  automatically unfold `baseChange`, so that lemma never fires on this spelling by itself.
* `WeierstrassCurve.shortCurve_equation_iff`: a point lies on it exactly when
  `y² = x³ + Ax + B`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.shortCurve_a₄_a₆`: a curve in short normal form is `shortCurve` of its own
  `a₄` and `a₆`. This is how a statement about an arbitrary `[W.IsShortNF]` reaches the explicit
  `y² = x³ + Ax + B` shape and the `shortCurve` API.
* `WeierstrassCurve.smul_shortCurve`: the scaling `(x, y) ↦ (u²x, u³y)` carries `shortCurve A B`
  to `shortCurve (u⁻⁴A) (u⁻⁶B)`. Over a field of characteristic other than `2` and `3` these
  scalings are the only changes of variables between short equations
  (`WeierstrassCurve.variableChange_a₄_of_isShortNF`), so this is the whole coefficient freedom
  of a short equation.

The classical discriminant `-16(4A³ + 27B²)` is *not* restated: it is Mathlib's `Δ_of_isShortNF`,
which the instance below makes applicable and the coefficient lemmas reduce.

This is a prerequisite of the Nagell–Lutz milestone of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, Layer 6, item "The torsion subgroup and Nagell–Lutz",
whose classical statement is about this curve and its discriminant.

## Provenance

Adapted from the AINTLIB `NagellLutz` project (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0,
`main @ 1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`),
`LutzNagell/LutzNagellTheorem/ShortWeierstrass.lean`: `shortCurveZ` (`:30`), `shortCurveQ` (`:34`),
`shortCurveQ_equation_iff` (`:58`) and `shortCurveZ_delta` (`:63`, not ported — see above).

Three departures. The source fixes `ℤ` and `ℚ`; here the construction needs only `Zero R`
(`WeierstrassCurve` is a bare structure), and `map_shortCurve` relates the two — so the `ℤ → ℚ`
pair of the classical statement is one definition plus a base change, not two definitions.
The source's ten
`@[simp]` coefficient lemmas — `shortCurve{Z,Q}_a₁` through `_a₆` — collapse to five, one per
coefficient, because the ℤ and ℚ copies become one general statement that `map_shortCurve`
transports to any base change. And `shortCurveZ_delta` is not ported at all: it is exactly
Mathlib's `Δ_of_isShortNF`, `W.Δ = -16 * (4 * W.a₄ ^ 3 + 27 * W.a₆ ^ 2)`, which the coefficient
lemmas above already reduce at `shortCurve A B`.

variable {R S : Type*} [CommRing R] [CommRing S] (A B : R)

/-- `shortCurve A B` is in short normal form. This instance is the point of the definition: it
hands the curve to Mathlib's whole `*_of_isShortNF` family, so every invariant — the `b`- and
`c`-families, `Δ` and `j` — comes for free rather than being restated here. -/
instance instIsShortNFShortCurve : (shortCurve A B).IsShortNF := ⟨(rfl), (rfl), (rfl)⟩

/-- A ring hom carries `shortCurve` to `shortCurve` on the images of the coefficients. Mathlib has
no instance propagating `IsShortNF` along `map`, so this is what keeps a base change — `ℤ → ℚ` in
the classical Nagell–Lutz statement — recognisably in short form. -/

/-- The same statement for a base change, which is the spelling consumers actually meet.
`baseChange` *is* `map (algebraMap R S)` by definition, which is why the proof below is just
`map_shortCurve` at that hom.

It is nonetheless worth stating and tagging `@[simp]`: `simp` does not automatically unfold
`baseChange`, which carries no simp lemma of its own, so `map_shortCurve` never fires on a
`baseChange` spelling. This lemma is that missing normalisation step, not a wrapper to name by
hand. -/
