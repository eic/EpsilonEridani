# Integrality of points on a Weierstrass curve over a unique factorization domain

Let `R` be a unique factorization domain with fraction field `K` and let `W : WeierstrassCurve R`
have coefficients in `R`. This file gives the three integrality steps of the Nagell–Lutz argument
that do not mention torsion.

The first is the rational-root step. If the `x`-coordinate of a `K`-point is a root of some
`f ∈ R[X]`, the rational root theorem bounds its denominator: `den x ∣ f.leadingCoeff`. On its own
that is far from integrality — but the denominator of a point is *powerful*
(`sq_dvd_den_of_prime_of_dvd`), so any prime dividing it divides it twice, hence divides
`f.leadingCoeff` twice. If that leading coefficient is squarefree, no prime can divide the
denominator at all, so `den x` is a unit and `x` is integral.

The second is a consequence of the curve equation alone: once `x` comes from `R`, `y` is a root of
the monic quadratic `Y² + (a₁x + a₃)Y − (x³ + a₂x² + a₄x + a₆)` over `R`, so `y` is integral over
`R`. That step needs no domain, fraction-field or factorisation hypothesis, so it is stated over an
arbitrary `R`-algebra, with the `IsLocalization.IsInteger` form as a corollary over any commutative
`R`-algebra in which `R` is integrally closed.

The third is the scaling that replaces integrality in the **order-two case**, the one case of
Nagell–Lutz where the conclusion is weaker. Where the `Y`-derivative of the Weierstrass polynomial
vanishes — `2y + a₁x + a₃ = 0`, which is what the division-polynomial API calls `ψ₂ = 0` — a bound
`4x ∈ R` scales to `8y ∈ R`. Like the second step this needs no domain, fraction field or
factorisation, only an `R`-algebra.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.isInteger_x_of_equation_of_is_root_of_squarefree_leadingCoeff`: the
  `x`-coordinate of a point is integral if it is a root of a polynomial over `R` with squarefree
  leading coefficient.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isIntegral_y_of_equation_of_isIntegral_x`: over **any** `R`-algebra, a
  point whose `x`-coordinate is integral over `R` has `y`-coordinate integral over `R`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isInteger_y_of_equation_of_isInteger_x`: its `IsLocalization.IsInteger`
  corollary over any commutative `R`-algebra in which `R` is integrally closed, the shape the
  Nagell–Lutz argument consumes.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isInteger_eight_mul_y_of_evalEval_polynomialY_eq_zero`: the third step, for the
  **order-two case**, where the first two do not give integrality of `y`. It is in the root
  `WeierstrassCurve` namespace, where `W.isInteger_eight_mul_y_…` elaborates; the declarations
  above predate that convention and `scripts/lint-dot-notation.py` carries them as grandfathered
  entries.

All three are stated for an arbitrary point: no torsion, ellipticity or minimality hypothesis. In
the Nagell–Lutz argument the polynomial `f` is a division polynomial, whose leading coefficient is
the order of the torsion point, and `ψ₂` vanishes exactly at the points of order two.

This advances the Nagell–Lutz integrality milestone of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, Layer 6, item "The torsion subgroup and Nagell–Lutz".

## Provenance

Ported from the AINTLIB `NagellLutz` project (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0), pinned by
that roadmap at `dev/modular-curves @ 9fec8eba7652`:
`LutzNagell/LutzNagellTheorem/PIDPrimeOrder.lean`, declarations
`isInteger_of_root_squarefree_leading_coeff` and `y_isInteger_of_x_isInteger_on_curve`. The latter
is generalised here from the fraction field to an arbitrary `R`-algebra.

`isInteger_eight_mul_y_of_evalEval_polynomialY_eq_zero` is the `y` half of
`bounded_den_of_order_two_general` (`LutzNagell/LutzNagellTheorem/GeneralPrimeOrder.lean:176` at
`main @ 1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`), which states both halves together over `ℚ`/`ℤ`
as `(∃ n : ℤ, (n : ℚ) = 4 * x) ∧ ∃ m : ℤ, (m : ℚ) = 8 * y` for a point of order two. Two departures:
the conclusion is `IsLocalization.IsInteger` over general `R`/`K`, so the source's
`isInteger_int_iff` bridge is not needed; and the two-torsion hypothesis is weakened to the
vanishing of `polynomialY`, which is what the `y` half actually uses and which makes the statement
independent of the point-level `[n]`-multiplication development. The `x` half is separately the
merged `den_dvd_four_of_order_two`.

`polynomialY` vanishes at `(x, y)` and `4x` is integral, then `8y` is integral.

This is the `y` half of the order-two exception in Nagell–Lutz — the case where a torsion point
need not have integral coordinates at all, and where `8y` rather than `y` is what lies in `R`.
`polynomialY` is `∂/∂Y` of the Weierstrass polynomial, evaluating to `2y + a₁x + a₃`, and is what
the division-polynomial API calls `ψ₂`. Taking its vanishing as the hypothesis is strictly weaker
than two-torsion and needs no field, no fraction ring and no `Nonsingular`: a point of order two
satisfies it, and so does any pair at which `ψ₂` happens to vanish. -/
