# The point count of a Weierstrass model

`pointCount` counts the `F`-points of the projective Weierstrass model: the solutions of the
affine equation, singular or not, together with the point at infinity, `[0 : 1 : 0]` being the only
point on `z = 0`. It is `Nat.card` of the solutions plus one, so it is the honest number of points
whenever that solution type is finite. It is the count against which the Frobenius trace
`q + 1 − #W(F)` is taken over a finite field, which is the setting it exists for.

Counting the singular point is the whole content of the convention, and it is what makes the trace
return the classical local invariant at *every* Weierstrass model: `a_q` at an elliptic one, and
`1`, `−1`, `0` at split multiplicative, nonsplit multiplicative and additive reduction. Against the
nonsingular locus instead it would omit the one singular rational point and return `2`, `0`, `1` at
those three, which is no classical invariant. So the definition carries no ellipticity hypothesis:
there is no junk value to avoid.

The `+ 1` is the line at infinity's contribution. `pointCount_eq_card_point` asks exactly for
finiteness of the solution subtype, which a finite base supplies: adjoining the point at infinity
then raises its `Nat.card` by one, which is what makes the comparison with Mathlib's point type go
through.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.pointCount`: the `Nat.card` count of the projective Weierstrass model's
  `F`-points.
* `WeierstrassCurve.frobeniusTrace`: over a finite field, the defect `q + 1 − #W(F)` of that
  count from `q + 1`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.pointCount_eq_card_point`: on an elliptic model whose affine solutions form a
  finite type — a finite base being one case of that — it is the cardinality of Mathlib's point
  type.
* `WeierstrassCurve.frobeniusTrace_eq_card_point`: over a finite field, on an elliptic model the
  trace is `q + 1` minus the cardinality of Mathlib's point type, which is the classical `a_q`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.variableChange_pointCount` and `WeierstrassCurve.variableChange_frobeniusTrace`:
  both are invariant under a change of variables, singular models included.

## Provenance

Not ported. The AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (Chris Birkbeck, Apache 2.0, commit
`513e83879e2f8cbc626eb9e04d660e92be16ccba`) has a `pointCount` of the same name in
`HasseWeil/Frobenius.lean`, but it is `Fintype.card E.Point` on an elliptic curve carrying a
`Fintype` instance as a hypothesis: the nonsingular-locus count, under the restriction where the
two agree. The definition here is the projective one and is taken for an arbitrary Weierstrass
model, so the comparison with the point type becomes a theorem.

Taken against that count the formula returns the classical local invariant at *every* Weierstrass
model: `a_q` at an elliptic one, and `1`, `−1`, `0` at split multiplicative, nonsplit
multiplicative and additive reduction. That is why it carries no ellipticity hypothesis. It is
elliptic-specific only in its reading as a *trace*, which rests on the identity
`deg (1 − π_q) = #E(𝔽_q)`. -/
