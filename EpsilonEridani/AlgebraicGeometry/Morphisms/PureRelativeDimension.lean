# Morphisms of pure relative dimension

A morphism of schemes has pure relative dimension `d` when it has relative dimension at most `d`
and every irreducible component of every nonempty fibre has dimension exactly `d`. Empty fibres
impose no component condition. The definition is expressed using set-theoretic fibres; Mathlib's
homeomorphism between a scheme-theoretic fibre and the corresponding set-theoretic fibre gives the
equivalent scheme-theoretic formulation.

The explicit dimension bound is included because the definition makes sense without a finiteness
hypothesis. For locally finite type morphisms it follows mathematically from equidimensionality of
the locally Noetherian fibres. Keeping it in the predicate makes the generally useful implication
to `RelativeDimensionLE` available without silently assuming local finite type.

Locally quasi-finite morphisms supply the basic example: their fibres are discrete and therefore
pure zero-dimensional. The property is invariant under isomorphisms of arrows and local on the
target. For morphisms locally of finite type it is also local on the source: the fibres are then
locally of finite type over a field, where a nonempty open part of an irreducible component has
the dimension of the component, so pure-dimensionality of a fibre can be tested on an open cover.
Without the finiteness hypothesis locality on the source fails already for
`Spec k[x]_(x) → Spec k`: its only fibre is irreducible of dimension one, while its open generic
point has dimension zero.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.PureRelativeDimension d f`: `f` has relative dimension at most `d`,
  and every fibre is pure-dimensional of dimension `d`.
* `pureRelativeDimension_iff_relativeDimensionLE_and_isPureDimensional_fiber`: the
  scheme-theoretic fibre characterization.
* `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.PureRelativeDimension.isPureDimensional_fiber`: the
  scheme-theoretic fibre formulation.
* `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.PureRelativeDimension.of_locallyQuasiFinite`: locally quasi-finite
  morphisms have pure relative dimension zero.
* `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.pureRelativeDimension_iff_of_field`: over a field, pure relative
  dimension is pure dimension of the source together with the dimension bound.
* `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.pureRelativeDimension_comp_iff_of_injective`: postcomposition with a
  morphism injective on points does not change pure relative dimension.
* `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.PureRelativeDimension.isZariskiLocalAtTarget`: locality on the target.
* `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.PureRelativeDimension.isOpenImmersion_comp` and
  `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.pureRelativeDimension_iff_of_openCover`: locality on the source for
  morphisms locally of finite type.
