# Semisimple affine group schemes are reductive

Every semisimple affine group scheme of finite type over a field is reductive. The coordinate
Hopf algebra of a semisimple group has no nontrivial connected normal smooth solvable closed
subgroup after extension to an algebraic closure. In particular it has no nontrivial connected
normal smooth unipotent closed subgroup, because a unipotent group is solvable. This is precisely
the normal-subgroup condition in the definition of reductivity.

The coordinate-Hopf-algebra implication is
`EpsilonEridani.semisimpleCommHopfAlgProperty.reductive`. This file transports it through the affine
Hopf/group-scheme anti-equivalence and packages the resulting fully faithful inclusion from
semisimple affine group schemes to reductive affine group schemes. The inclusion leaves the
underlying finite-type affine group scheme and every morphism unchanged.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.semisimpleAffineGroupSchemeProperty.reductive`: a semisimple finite-type affine group
  scheme is reductive.
* `EpsilonEridani.semisimpleToReductiveAffineGroupSchemeFunctor`: the fully faithful inclusion of
  semisimple affine group schemes into reductive affine group schemes.

## References

* J. S. Milne, *Algebraic Groups* (2017), Section 21.

This is the scheme-side structural implication in Layer 6, "Reductive and semisimple groups", of
the ReductiveGroups roadmap. It synchronizes the coordinate and affine-group-scheme models used
by the simply connected and adjoint form constructions.
