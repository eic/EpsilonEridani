# Iterates of inflationary maps on the finsets of a finite type

A map `f` on the finsets of a finite type `α` that enlarges every finset, `s ⊆ f s`, can grow a
finset only `Fintype.card α` times before it stops. This file records the resulting bound: the
`Fintype.card α`-th iterate of `f` at any starting finset is a fixed point of `f`. It is the
termination argument behind every closure computed by "repeat until nothing changes" on a finite
carrier, stated once so that such computations can iterate a fixed number of times and remain
executable.

Mathlib's `Finset.image_iterate_stabilises_le_card` is the analogous statement for the decreasing
sequence of images of a finset under the iterates of a self-map of `α`; here the sequence is
increasing and the map acts on finsets.

## Main results

* `Finset.isFixedPt_iterate_card`: for `f` with `s ⊆ f s` for all `s`, the finset
  `f^[Fintype.card α] s` is a fixed point of `f`.
