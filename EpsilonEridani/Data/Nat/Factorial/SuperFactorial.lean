# Positivity of the superfactorial

`Nat.superFactorial n = 0! · 1! ⋯ n!` is Mathlib's superfactorial, and
`Nat.prod_range_succ_factorial` is its expansion as a product of factorials.  Mathlib does not
record the immediate consequence that the value is positive, which is what lets the superfactorial
be cancelled from an identity over `ℕ`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Nat.superFactorial_pos`: the superfactorial is positive.
