# Products over a set of prime factors

A product of distinct primes taken from `n.primeFactors` is squarefree, divides `n`, and introduces
no prime that `n` does not already have; and it is coprime to any prime left out of the set. These
are the facts an induction over the primes of `n` spends at each step, when it peels one prime off
and recurses on the rest.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.squarefree_prod_and_coprime_of_subset_primeFactors`: the three facts above, for a subset
  of `n.primeFactors` and a prime outside it.

/-- **A product of some of `n`'s prime factors is squarefree, coprime to any prime left out, and
introduces no new prime.** For `S ⊆ n.primeFactors` and a prime `p ∉ S`, the product `∏ q ∈ S, q`
is squarefree (the members are distinct primes), coprime to `p` (it is coprime to each member), and
its prime factors are again among `n`'s (it divides `n`). -/
