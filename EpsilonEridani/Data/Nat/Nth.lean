# Recognizing `Nat.nth` from counts

`Nat.nth p k` is the `k`-th natural number satisfying `p`, and `0` when `p` holds at most `k`
times. Mathlib's `Nat.nth_count` identifies it whenever a witness is available: if `p n` holds and
`p` has exactly `k` predecessors below `n`, then `nth p k = n`. What is missing is the converse
bookkeeping — the *only if* half, including the degenerate branch — which is what a case analysis
on the value of `nth p k` needs.

`EpsilonEridani.Nat.nth_eq_iff` supplies it: `nth p k = m` exactly when `m` is a counting witness, or else
`m = 0` and no counting witness exists at all. The two branches are mutually exclusive, and a
counting witness is unique when it exists, because `Nat.count p` strictly increases across a point
where `p` holds.

The degenerate branch is not a technicality that can be assumed away: `nth p k = 0` really does
happen when `p` has at most `k` witnesses, and a description of the fibres of `nth` has to name
that case. This makes the statement a usable membership criterion — for instance, it exhibits each
fibre of `x ↦ Nat.nth (fun i => x i = a) k` as a countable Boolean combination of conditions on
finitely many of the values of `x`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Nat.nth_eq_zero_of_forall_count_ne`: with no counting witness, `Nat.nth` takes its junk
  value.
* `EpsilonEridani.Nat.nth_eq_iff`: the fibres of `Nat.nth p`.
