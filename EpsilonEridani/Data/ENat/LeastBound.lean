# The least natural number satisfying a predicate, in `ℕ∞`

For a predicate `P : ℕ → Prop`, `EpsilonEridani.leastENatBound P` is the infimum in `ℕ∞` of the natural
numbers satisfying `P`. It is `⊤` exactly when no natural number satisfies `P`, so an invariant
defined as the least `n` for which some bound holds takes the value `⊤` rather than being
undefined when no bound holds at all. Invariants of this shape are cohomological dimensions,
where `P n` says that cohomology vanishes above degree `n`.

When `P` is monotone (a bound at `m` gives a bound at every `n ≥ m`), the characterization
`leastENatBound P ≤ n ↔ P n` recovers the predicate from the invariant.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.leastENatBound`: the infimum in `ℕ∞` of the natural numbers satisfying a predicate.
* `EpsilonEridani.leastENatBound_le_iff`: for a monotone predicate, `leastENatBound P ≤ n ↔ P n`.
* `EpsilonEridani.leastENatBound_eq_top_iff`: the value is `⊤` exactly when the predicate never holds.
* `EpsilonEridani.leastENatBound_antitone`: a weaker predicate has a smaller least bound.
