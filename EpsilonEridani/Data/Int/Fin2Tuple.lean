# Two-entry integer tuples

Arithmetic of `Fin 2 → ℤ`. Nothing here involves matrices; the results are stated for tuples
so that callers holding a diagonal, a pair of invariant factors, or any other two integers can
use them without dragging in linear algebra.

## Main results

* `Int.eq_of_dvd_of_dvd_of_mul_eq_mul`: two tuples with positive, mutually dividing first
  entries and equal products are equal.

## Provenance

Adapted from [AINTLIB](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB) (Chris Birkbeck), Apache-2.0, at
commit `2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08`, from
`LeanModularForms/HeckeRIngs/GLn/CongruenceHecke/AtkinLehner.lean`. The source's
`snf_mutual_dvd_eq` draws the same conclusion from Smith-normal-form data and routes through
`smith_normal_form_unique`; `Int.eq_of_dvd_of_dvd_of_mul_eq_mul` keeps none of those matrix
hypotheses and does not use it.

/-- **Two `Fin 2 → ℤ` tuples with positive, mutually dividing first entries and equal products
are equal.** The first entries agree by antisymmetry of divisibility among positives, and the
second is then pinned by cancelling the first out of the product.

Only the *first* entries are assumed positive; the second may be negative or zero. -/
