# Finite sums and finite types

`Unit ⊕ Unit` and `Fin 2`, or `Unit ⊕ Unit ⊕ Unit` and `Fin 3`, are the two ways a small index
type arises: one variable per named slot, or one variable per numeral. Translating between them
is pure bookkeeping, needed wherever an object indexed by named slots must be presented against
an API indexed by `Fin n`.

More generally, an embedding of a type `α` into `Fin n` identifies `Fin n` with the sum of `α`
and a finite complementary type.  This packages the standard splitting of a finite type along
the range of an embedding.

The two `Unit`-sum equivalences are Mathlib's own compositions — `finOneEquiv` on each summand,
then `finSumFinEquiv` — given a name and their evaluation lemmas, so that call sites reindexing a
two- or three-variable object can rewrite rather than unfold them.

## Main definitions

* `unitSumUnitEquivFinTwo`: the equivalence `Unit ⊕ Unit ≃ Fin 2`, sending the left summand to
  `0` and the right to `1`.
* `unitSumUnitSumUnitEquivFinThree`: the equivalence `Unit ⊕ Unit ⊕ Unit ≃ Fin 3`, sending the
  outer left summand to `0` and the two inner ones to `1` and `2`.
* `Function.Embedding.exists_equiv_sum_fin`: an embedding into `Fin n` extends to an equivalence
  from the sum with a finite complement.

## Implementation notes

The constructions are implementation details: `Mathlib.Data.Fintype.EquivFin` and
`Mathlib.Logic.Equiv.Fin.Basic` are imported privately rather than re-exported. Only the
equivalence and embedding interfaces needed by the declaration types are public.

/-- The equivalence `Unit ⊕ Unit ≃ Fin 2`, sending the left summand to `0` and the right to `1`.

An `Equiv` rather than a bare `Function.Embedding`: injectivity is what turns a coefficient under
a reindexing into an equality rather than a sum over a fibre, but surjectivity is what lets a
statement about *every* `Fin 2` index be pulled back, and both directions are wanted downstream. -/
