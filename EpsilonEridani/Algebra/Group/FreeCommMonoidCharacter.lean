# Characters of a free commutative monoid

The free commutative monoid on an index type `σ` is modelled as `Multiplicative (σ →₀ ℕ)`: its
underlying additive monoid `σ →₀ ℕ` is the free `ℕ`-module on `σ`. This file records its
universal property in the form most useful for the functor of points of an affine semigroup: a
homomorphism `Multiplicative (σ →₀ ℕ) →* M` to a commutative monoid `M` is the same data as a
family `σ → M`.

The equivalence sends a homomorphism `χ` to its values `i ↦ χ (ofAdd (single i 1))` on the
standard generators, and a family `c : σ → M` to the unique homomorphism extending it. This is
the many-generator version of Mathlib's `powersHom : M ≃ (Multiplicative ℕ →* M)` (the case of
one generator), and the monoid counterpart of `EpsilonEridani.freeAbelianCharEquiv` in
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.Group.FreeAbelianCharacter`: no invertibility is imposed on the values. The two
appear together whenever a semigroup splits as a product of a free commutative monoid and a free
abelian group, as the dual semigroup of a smooth cone does; the values of a character on the free
monoid factor may vanish, while those on the free abelian factor are units.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.freeCommMonoidCharEquiv`: the multiplicative equivalence
  `(Multiplicative (σ →₀ ℕ) →* M) ≃* (σ → M)`.

## References

The construction reuses Mathlib's group-algebra-free toolkit: the `Finsupp.liftAddHom`
universal property of `σ →₀ ℕ`, the `ℕ`-power homomorphism `multiplesHom`, and the type-tag
adjunction `AddMonoidHom.toMultiplicativeLeft` from `Mathlib.Algebra.Group.TypeTags.Hom`.

homomorphism to a commutative monoid `M` is the same data as a family `σ → M`. The forward map
