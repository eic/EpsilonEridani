# Positive weights orthogonal to integer subgroups

A subgroup of `ι → ℤ` contains no nonzero nonnegative vector exactly when it is orthogonal to a
vector of strictly positive integer weights. This is the integer-lattice form of Stiemke's theorem.

For a pointed Heegaard diagram, `ι` indexes its regions, and `P` is the subgroup of periodic
domains. Weak admissibility, for all `Spin^c` structures at once, says every nonzero periodic
domain has positive and negative multiplicities. Since `P` is closed under negation, this is the
condition below. The weights give positive target areas for the regions, with zero signed area
for every periodic domain. Applying the result to diagrams requires a separate construction of
their periodic-domain subgroup.

## Main result

* `AddSubgroup.exists_pos_dotProduct_eq_zero_iff`.

/-- A subgroup `P` of `ι → ℤ` contains no nonzero nonnegative vector exactly when some vector of
strictly positive integer weights is orthogonal to all of `P`.

For the group of periodic domains of a pointed Heegaard diagram, the weights are the areas of the
regions for an area form in which every periodic domain has signed area zero; compare
