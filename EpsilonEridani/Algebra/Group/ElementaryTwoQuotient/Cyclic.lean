# The maximal elementary-2 quotient of a cyclic group

For a cyclic group `G`, the maximal elementary-2 quotient `G / G²` of
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.Group.ElementaryTwoQuotient.Basic` has cardinality `gcd |G| 2`, where `|G|` is
read via `Nat.card` (so `|G| = 0` for an infinite cyclic group). This unifies the parities: a
finite cyclic group of even order and an infinite cyclic group both have two square classes
(`gcd |G| 2 = 2`), and a finite cyclic group of odd order has one. The even reading and its
2-rank are corollaries.

The finite case is Mathlib's index computation `IsCyclic.index_powMonoidHom_range` (the subgroup
of `d`-th powers has index `gcd |G| d`) read through `G² = range (powMonoidHom 2)`; the infinite
case is `G ≃* Multiplicative ℤ`, whose elementary-2 quotient is `2 ^ finrank ℤ ℤ = 2`.

These are the cyclic building blocks promised by the product lemmas of
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.Group.ElementaryTwoQuotient.Prod`: a finite abelian group is a product of cyclic
groups, and combining that decomposition with this file reads off its 2-rank as the number of
even-order cyclic factors. The multiquadratic roadmap consumes the even case through the torsion
subgroup of a number field's unit group, which is finite cyclic of even order. The odd-order case
also holds for any commutative group (no cyclicity), as
`EpsilonEridani.card_elementaryTwoQuotient_of_odd_card` in `Basic`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.card_elementaryTwoQuotient_of_isCyclic`: `|G/G²| = gcd |G| 2` for cyclic `G`.
* `EpsilonEridani.card_elementaryTwoQuotient_of_isCyclic_of_even`: the even reading, `2`.
* `EpsilonEridani.twoRank_of_isCyclic_of_even`: an even-order cyclic group has 2-rank `1`.
