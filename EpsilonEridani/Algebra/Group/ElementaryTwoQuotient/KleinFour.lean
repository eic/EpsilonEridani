# Elementary abelian groups of order `4`

An additive commutative group of cardinality four that is a `ZMod 2`-module is a Klein four-group.

A commutative group of order `4` whose maximal elementary-2 quotient `G / G²` has `2`-rank `2` is
as large as that quotient, so every element squares to one
(`EpsilonEridani.sq_eq_one_of_card_elementaryTwoQuotient_eq_card`) and `G` is a Klein four-group.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isAddKleinFour_of_natCard_eq_four`: a `ZMod 2`-module of cardinality four is a
  Klein four-group.
* `EpsilonEridani.isKleinFour_of_card_eq_four_of_twoRank_eq_two`: such a group is a Klein four-group.
