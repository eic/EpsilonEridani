# Unopposing a commutative group

Mathlib's `MulOpposite.opMulEquiv` identifies a commutative monoid with its opposite when
the commutativity is available as a `CommMonoid` instance. This file provides the
explicit-hypothesis variant: for a monoid whose multiplication commutes, as a hypothesis
rather than an instance, the unopposite map is a monoid isomorphism. This is what makes the
opposite disappear in comparisons such as `EpsilonEridani.Deck.IsRegular.fundamentalGroupDeckEquiv`,
where the deck group is commutative by a proof, not by an instance.
