# Centralizers and maximal commutative subgroups

Centralizers of a group of units are computed on the underlying monoid: a unit centralizes another
exactly when their values commute. Mathlib has both halves —
`Subgroup.mem_centralizer_singleton_iff` turns membership into an equation, and
`Commute.units_val_iff` transports that equation between `Mˣ` and `M` — but not their combination,
which is the form every concrete centralizer computation in a matrix group starts from.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.mem_centralizer_singleton_iff_commute_val`: a unit lies in the centralizer of a unit `g`
  exactly when the two commute as elements of the monoid.
* `Subgroup.eq_of_centralizer_eq_self_of_le_of_isMulCommutative`: a self-centralizing subgroup is
  maximal among commutative subgroups.
