# The kernel of the automorphism representation of a group acting on a ring

A group `G` acting on a semiring `S` by ring automorphisms is represented by
`MulSemiringAction.toRingAut G S`. This file reads off the kernel of that representation: an
element lies in it exactly when it fixes every element of `S`, so the kernel is trivial precisely
because the action is faithful.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.MulSemiringAction.mem_ker_toRingAut_iff`: membership in the kernel is acting trivially
  on every element.
* `EpsilonEridani.MulSemiringAction.ker_toRingAut_eq_bot`: a faithful action is a faithful
  representation.
