# `1 + a * b` is a unit exactly when `1 + b * a` is

In a ring, possibly noncommutative, the two products `a * b` and `b * a` are generally unrelated,
but `1 + a * b` and `1 + b * a` are invertible together. This is the elementwise shadow of the
fact that `a * b` and `b * a` have the same spectrum away from `0`, and it is the mechanism behind
the left-right symmetry of the Jacobson radical.

Mathlib records the spectral statement as `spectrum.unit_mem_mul_comm`. The elementwise form is
that statement for the base ring `ℤ`, read at the unit `1`, and that is how it is obtained here.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isUnit_one_sub_mul_comm`: `IsUnit (1 - a * b) ↔ IsUnit (1 - b * a)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isUnit_one_add_mul_comm`: `IsUnit (1 + a * b) ↔ IsUnit (1 + b * a)`.
