# The Frobenius-fixed points of the type-A carrier

`EpsilonEridani.SlStd.groupScheme r` is the explicit full-weight Chevalley carrier of type `A_r`, and
`EpsilonEridani.SlStd.frobenius r p k K` is the `p ^ k`-power Frobenius endomorphism of its point group
over a field `K` of exponential characteristic `p`. This file identifies the subgroup that
endomorphism fixes: writing `𝔽` for the Frobenius-fixed subfield
`EpsilonEridani.frobeniusFixedSubfield K p k`, it is `SL_{r+1}(𝔽)`.

Two results on `main` come close without pinning the fixed group down.
`EpsilonEridani.SlStd.map_subtype_fixedSubgroup_frobenius_eq` says the fixed points are the carrier's
points over the Frobenius-fixed *subring*, which is a statement about the carrier and not about a
matrix group; `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.points_eq_range_toGL` identifies the carrier's points over a field
with `SL_{r+1}` of that field, but says nothing about a Frobenius. Composing them needs the
observation that over a field the fixed subring is a subfield, which is
`EpsilonEridani.toSubring_frobeniusFixedSubfield`, and the composite is what turns the fixed group into
an explicit matrix group.

The consequence that makes the construction worth performing is finiteness: over a field of
characteristic `p` and for `k ≠ 0` the subfield `𝔽` is finite, so the fixed group is a finite
matrix group. For `p` prime, `k ≠ 0` and `K` separably closed of characteristic `p`, `𝔽` has
exactly `p ^ k` elements by `EpsilonEridani.card_frobeniusFixedSubfield`, so that group is `SL_{r+1}(q)`
with `q = p ^ k`. The isomorphism `𝔽 ≃+* GaloisField p k` is not canonical, so nothing below
phrases the fixed group over `GaloisField p k`.

At `k = 0` the fixed subfield is all of `K` and the statements degenerate to
`EpsilonEridani.SlStd.points_eq_range_toGL`, which is correct rather than vacuous: the zeroth Frobenius
iterate is the identity and fixes every point.

Nothing here asserts that the carrier is reductive, that the fixed group is perfect or simple, or
that it is isomorphic to any other construction of a finite group of Lie type. The corresponding
statement for the graph-twisted Frobenius is not a corollary of anything below: that map couples
the matrix entries, so its fixed set is not the points over a subfield.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.specialLinearToFixedSubgroupFrobenius`: the homomorphism from `SL_{r+1}(𝔽)` to the
  Frobenius-fixed points of the type-`A_r` carrier, given by including the matrix entries.
* `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.specialLinearMulEquivFixedSubgroupFrobenius`: it is an isomorphism.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.mem_fixedSubgroup_frobenius_iff`: a carrier point is Frobenius-fixed exactly when
  all of its matrix entries lie in the Frobenius-fixed subfield.
* `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.mapGL_mem_fixedSubgroup_frobenius` and
  `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.exists_mapGL_eq_of_mem_fixedSubgroup_frobenius`: the two directions of the
  identification, before it is packaged as a homomorphism.
* `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.map_subtype_fixedSubgroup_frobenius_eq_range_mapGL`: read inside `GL_{r+1}(K)`,
  the Frobenius-fixed points are exactly the image of `SL_{r+1}(𝔽)`, and
  `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.mem_map_subtype_fixedSubgroup_frobenius_iff` is the entrywise form of that: they
  are the invertible matrices of determinant one with entries in `𝔽`.
* `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.finite_fixedSubgroup_frobenius` and
  `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.finite_fixedSubgroup_frobenius_of_charP`: the fixed group is finite.

This advances the target "points over an algebraically closed field as a group, functorially in
the field, so that a field endomorphism induces a group endomorphism of the points. The `q`-power
Frobenius is the case a consumer asks for first" in Layer 9 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`, by saying which points that endomorphism fixes. Its
consumer is milestone L3 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`, which sets `H_d` to be the
fixed subgroup of the Steinberg map of a valid Lie-type index; on the untwisted type-`A` branch
the Steinberg map is the Frobenius, and this says what `H_d` is there.

/-- The Frobenius-fixed points of the type-`A_r` carrier form a finite group as soon as the
Frobenius-fixed subfield is finite. -/

end

/-- **The Frobenius-fixed points of the type-`A_r` carrier over a field of characteristic `p` form
a finite group**, for every nonzero exponent: the Frobenius-fixed subfield is a set of roots of
`X ^ p ^ k - X`, hence finite.

Separable closedness is not needed for finiteness, only for the count: when `K` is separably closed
the subfield has exactly `p ^ k` elements by `EpsilonEridani.card_frobeniusFixedSubfield`, so the fixed
group is `SL_{r+1}(q)` with `q = p ^ k`, while over an arbitrary field of characteristic `p` it is
`SL_{r+1}` of a possibly smaller finite field. This is the first point at which the construction
produces a finite group; no order formula, perfectness or simplicity statement is claimed. -/
