# The graph-twisted Frobenius of the full-weight type-A carrier

`EpsilonEridani.SlStd.groupScheme r` is the explicit full-weight Chevalley carrier of type `A_r`, and its
point group over a commutative ring `A` of exponential characteristic `p` carries two pinned
endomorphisms: the `p ^ k`-power Frobenius `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.frobenius`, which raises every matrix
entry to its `p ^ k`-th power, and the graph automorphism
`EpsilonEridani.SlStd.graphAutomorphismPoints`, which is signed reverse inverse transpose. This file
composes them into

```text
twistedFrobenius = γ ∘ Frob_q,      q = p ^ k,
```

and proves the three relations that make the composite behave like the Frobenius it twists: the two
factors commute, `γ` is an involution, and consequently

```text
twistedFrobenius ∘ twistedFrobenius = Frob_(q ^ 2).
```

The commutation is not a computation about the carrier: signed reverse inverse transpose is defined
by matrices with entries `0` and `±1`, so it is natural in the coefficient ring, and the Frobenius
is the entrywise action of a ring endomorphism of that same coefficient ring.

The square relation has an arithmetic reading. Every point fixed by the twisted map is fixed by
`Frob_(q ^ 2)`, so its matrix entries lie in the subring of `A` fixed by the `q ^ 2`-power
Frobenius. That subring is a field of `q ^ 2` elements only under hypotheses none of the statements
below assume: `p` prime, `0 < k`, and `A` an algebraic closure of `ZMod p`. Under those hypotheses,
and for `2 ≤ r`, it is the usual statement that the twisted family of type `A` at parameter `q` has
a matrix realization over `𝔽_{q ^ 2}` while its Frobenius parameter is `q`. At the other permitted
parameters the reading fails; at `k = 0` the exponent `q ^ 2` is `1` and the fixed subring is all
of `A`. Only the containment is proved; no reverse containment is claimed, and nothing here
asserts that either fixed group is finite, is perfect, or is simple.

The value ring is taken in `Type`, matching `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.graphAutomorphismPoints`. That is
inherited rather than chosen here: the coordinate automorphism the graph automorphism descends from
is recovered through the full faithfulness of the points functor on `CommAlgCat.{0} ℤ`, so
`EpsilonEridani.GeneralLinear.pointsMulEquiv_comp_typeAGraphCoordinateIso` and every point-level
consequence of it are stated at universe `0`. `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.frobenius`, which is
universe-polymorphic, is specialized to that universe here.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.twistedFrobenius`: the composite `γ ∘ Frob_q` on the type-`A_r` point group.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.graphAutomorphismPoints_frobenius` and
  `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.graphAutomorphismPoints_comp_frobenius`: the graph automorphism commutes with
  Frobenius.
* `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.twistedFrobenius_rootSubgroupPoints` and
  `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.twistedFrobenius_weightTorusPoints`: the equations on the pinned generating root
  subgroups and split torus, which reverse the Bourbaki numbering and raise the parameter to its
  `p ^ k`-th power.
* `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.twistedFrobenius_twistedFrobenius` and
  `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.twistedFrobenius_comp_self`: the square of the twisted map is the
  `p ^ (2 * k)`-power Frobenius, pointwise and as an identity of endomorphisms.
* `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.fixedSubgroup_twistedFrobenius_le_fixedSubgroup_frobenius` and
  `EpsilonEridani.SlStd.map_subtype_fixedSubgroup_twistedFrobenius_le`: its fixed points lie among the
  points over the `p ^ (2 * k)`-power Frobenius-fixed subring.

This advances the "Pinnings" and "points over an algebraically closed field" targets in Layer 9 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`. Its consumer is milestone L1 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`, which sets the `²A` Steinberg map to `γ₂ ∘ Frob_q` and
requires exactly `γ₂ ^ 2 = 1` together with the commutation of `γ₂` with `Frob_q`.

/-- **The graph-twisted `p ^ k`-power Frobenius of the full-weight type-`A_r` carrier**, the

For `2 ≤ r`, `p` prime, `0 < k`, and `A` an algebraic closure of `ZMod p`, this is the Steinberg
map intended for a future construction of the twisted family `²A_r(p ^ k)`; at `r ≤ 1` the type-`A`
diagram has no nontrivial symmetry and there is no such family. None of those hypotheses are
assumed here, and nothing here asserts that the fixed group is finite or simple. -/

that subring is the field of `p ^ (2 * k)` elements; if moreover `2 ≤ r`, so that the type-`A`
diagram has a nontrivial symmetry and a twisted family exists, this is the statement that the
twisted family at Frobenius parameter `q = p ^ k` is realized by matrices over `𝔽_{q ^ 2}`. Without
