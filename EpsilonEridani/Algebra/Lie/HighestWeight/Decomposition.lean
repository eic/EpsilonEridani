# The packaged isotypic decomposition `M ≅ ⨁ L(λ)^{m λ}`

Let `L` be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with non-degenerate Killing form over an algebraically
closed field of characteristic zero, let `H` be a Cartan subalgebra and `b` a base of its root
system. Weyl's theorem decomposes a finite-dimensional `L`-module `M` into irreducible Lie
submodules, and `LieModule.isotypicMultiplicity` counts how many of them lie in a given
isomorphism class, independently of the decomposition. This file assembles the two into the single
statement a consumer wants:

`M ≃ₗ⁅K,L⁆ ⨁ (λ, k), L(λ)`,

the sum being over pairs of a dominant integral weight `λ` and a counter `k` in
`Fin (m λ)`, where `m λ` is the multiplicity of `L(λ)` in `M`
(`EpsilonEridani.nonempty_lieModuleEquiv_directSum_irreducibleQuotient`). Only finitely many
multiplicities are nonzero, so all but finitely many summands are indexed by the empty type.

The companion statement `LieModule.nonempty_lieModuleEquiv_isotypicComponent` of
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/UniversalEnveloping/Multiplicity.lean` decomposes one isotypic component as a
power `S^{⊕ m}` of a single irreducible. It is not what proves the theorem below, since nothing
so far exhibits `M` as the direct sum of its isotypic components; the decomposition into
irreducibles is regrouped directly instead.

## The argument

Each irreducible summand `N i` of a decomposition of `M` carries a highest weight vector of a
dominant integral weight `c i`, and two irreducible modules with highest weight vectors of the same
weight are equivalent, so `N i ≃ L(c i)`
(`EpsilonEridani.exists_isDominantIntegral_nonempty_lieModuleEquiv_irreducibleQuotient`). Regrouping the
decomposition by the label `c` is `DirectSum.nonempty_lieModuleEquiv_sigma_of_isInternal`, and what
it asks for is that the fibre of `c` over `λ` have exactly `m λ` elements. That is
`EpsilonEridani.natCard_eq_isotypicMultiplicity_irreducibleQuotient`, and it splits in two.

For a weight `λ` whose Verma module is nonzero, `L(λ)` is irreducible, and finite-dimensional
because `λ` is dominant integral, so `LieModule.isotypicMultiplicity_eq_ncard_of_isInternal`
counts the summands equivalent to it; those are exactly the summands labelled `λ`, by the
classification of the irreducible highest weight modules.

For a weight `λ` whose Verma module vanishes, `L(λ)` is the zero module
(`EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_irreducibleQuotient_iff`). Both sides are then `0`: the multiplicity of the
zero module is zero, and no summand can be labelled `λ`, an irreducible summand being nonzero.
This case is not vacuous bookkeeping: whether `M(λ) ≠ 0` for every dominant integral `λ`
is exactly the Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt input that
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/HighestWeight/Verma.lean` does not have, and the decomposition below is
stated so as not to need it.

## The decomposition read on characters

Formal characters are additive over an internal decomposition
(`EpsilonEridani.formalCharacter_eq_sum_of_isInternal`), so the same regrouping turns the decomposition
into the character identity `ch M = ∑_λ m_λ · ch L(λ)`, the form in which "decompose `M` into
irreducibles" becomes a computation. The formal character is defined only for a
finite-dimensional module, and `L(λ)` is finite-dimensional at every dominant integral `λ`
(`EpsilonEridani.finiteDimensional_irreducibleQuotient_of_isDominantIntegral`); at a non-dominant `λ` it
is infinite-dimensional as soon as `M(λ) ≠ 0`, that being what gives it a highest weight vector
(`EpsilonEridani.finiteDimensional_iff_isDominantIntegral_of_isHighestWeightVector`), and otherwise it is
the zero module, which is finite-dimensional but occurs in nothing. So the sum does not
run over all of `Module.Dual K H`: `EpsilonEridani.irreducibleFormalCharacter` names the character of
`L(λ)` as a function of a weight *bundled with its dominance*, and the sum runs over that subtype.
`EpsilonEridani.irreducibleFormalCharacter_def` unfolds it wherever the finite-dimensionality instance is
already at hand, so the definition itself never needs unfolding.

The missing Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt input does not make that character an unknown quantity.
`EpsilonEridani.irreducibleFormalCharacter_eq_zero_iff` says it vanishes exactly when `M(λ)` does, so a
weight contributing to a character identity has an irreducible `L(λ)`
(`EpsilonEridani.isIrreducible_irreducibleQuotient_of_irreducibleFormalCharacter_ne_zero`) and a weight
not contributing has the zero module, with the zero multiplicity that a decomposition into
irreducibles gives it. At `λ = 0` the input is available outright, so
`EpsilonEridani.irreducibleFormalCharacter_zero_ne_zero` is unconditional and the character API is not
vacuous.

Restricting the sum to the dominant integral weights loses nothing:
`EpsilonEridani.isotypicMultiplicity_irreducibleQuotient_eq_zero_of_not_isDominantIntegral` says that
`L(λ)` for a non-dominant `λ` has multiplicity zero in every finite-dimensional module, so every
multiplicity the sum omits is zero.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.irreducibleFormalCharacter`: the formal character of `L(λ)`, at a dominant integral `λ`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.natCard_eq_isotypicMultiplicity_irreducibleQuotient`: **the summands of a decomposition
  labelled by a dominant integral `λ` are counted by the multiplicity of `L(λ)`.**
* `EpsilonEridani.nonempty_lieModuleEquiv_directSum_irreducibleQuotient`: **the packaged isotypic
  decomposition** `M ≃ ⨁_λ L(λ)^{m λ}`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isotypicMultiplicity_irreducibleQuotient_eq_zero_of_not_isDominantIntegral`: `L(λ)` of
  a non-dominant weight `λ` has multiplicity zero in every finite-dimensional module.
* `EpsilonEridani.irreducibleFormalCharacter_eq_zero_iff` and
  `EpsilonEridani.isIrreducible_irreducibleQuotient_of_irreducibleFormalCharacter_ne_zero`: the character
  of `L(lam)` vanishes exactly when `M(lam)` does, so **a nonzero character is the character of an
  irreducible module.**
* `EpsilonEridani.irreducibleFormalCharacter_zero_ne_zero`: **the character of `L(0)` is nonzero**, with
  no appeal to Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt.
* `EpsilonEridani.formalCharacter_eq_finsum_isotypicMultiplicity_smul`: **the character of a
  finite-dimensional module is the multiplicity-weighted sum of the irreducible characters.**
