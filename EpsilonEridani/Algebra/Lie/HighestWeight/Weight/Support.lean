# The weight support of a highest weight module

Let `L` be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with non-degenerate Killing form over an algebraically
closed field of characteristic zero, let `H` be a splitting Cartan subalgebra, let `b` be a base of
its root system, and let `M` be an `L`-module carrying a highest weight vector of weight `lam`.
This file describes the weights of `M` in two ways.

If `M` is irreducible and `lam` is dominant integral, `M` has only **finitely many** weights. `M`
is not assumed finite-dimensional, and that is the whole point: for the modules `L(lam)` of
Layer 4 of the highest weight roadmap, finite-dimensionality is the conclusion. Together with
finite-dimensionality of the individual weight spaces it is what makes `L(lam)` finite-dimensional.

If instead `M` is finite-dimensional, every weight of `M` has a **dominant integral Weyl
conjugate** which is again a weight of `M`. That is the form in which a weight of `M` is compared
with `lam`, for example by the Casimir scalar in
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/HighestWeight/Separation.lean`; dominance is what makes the invariant form
available with a sign.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.finite_setOf_genWeightSpace_ne_bot_of_isHighestWeightVector`: **an irreducible highest
  weight module of dominant integral weight has finitely many weights.**
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_weylGroup_smul_isDominantIntegral_of_genWeightSpace_ne_bot`: **every weight of a
  finite-dimensional highest weight module has a dominant integral Weyl conjugate, again a weight
  of the module.**

## The argument

Three facts about the weights of `M` are already available, none of them needing
finite-dimensionality:

* they lie in the cone `lam - Q⁺`, by the weight-cone theorem of
  `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/HighestWeight/Module.lean`;
* they take integer values on the simple coroots
  (`EpsilonEridani.exists_int_apply_coroot_of_genWeightSpace_ne_bot_of_isHighestWeightVector`);
* they are stable under the simple reflections
  (`EpsilonEridani.genWeightSpace_rootSystem_reflection_ne_bot`).

`EpsilonEridani.finite_of_forall_reflection_mem_of_sub_mem_posRootCone` turns exactly that combination
into finiteness, so the work here is to feed the three facts to it and then to remove the linearity
restriction: a weight of `M` is a priori only a function `H → K`, but every weight of a highest
weight module is of the form `lam - ν`, hence linear, by
`EpsilonEridani.exists_sub_eq_of_genWeightSpace_ne_bot_of_isHighestWeightVector_of_lieSpan_eq_top`.

The dominant conjugate comes from the same cone induction, used one step earlier: the raising step
`EpsilonEridani.exists_weylGroup_smul_dominant_of_forall_reflection_mem_of_sub_mem_posRootCone` records
which Weyl translate reaches a dominant member, and finiteness is its corollary. There the three
facts are read off a finite-dimensional module instead, which needs neither irreducibility nor
dominance of `lam`: the weights of such a module are Weyl stable
(`EpsilonEridani.formalCharacter_coeff_weylGroup_smul`) and integral
(`EpsilonEridani.isIntegralWeight_of_formalCharacter_coeff_ne_zero`).

/-- **An irreducible highest weight module of dominant integral weight has finitely many
weights.** Let `M` be irreducible with a highest weight vector of dominant integral weight `lam`.
Then only finitely many functions on the Cartan subalgebra have a nonzero weight space in `M`.

`M` is not assumed finite-dimensional. The three inputs — the weight cone `lam - Q⁺`, integrality
on the simple coroots, and stability under the simple reflections — are exactly the hypotheses of
`EpsilonEridani.finite_of_forall_reflection_mem_of_sub_mem_posRootCone`, and each of them follows from
`hv`, from dominance integrality of `lam`, and from irreducibility of `M` (used only through the
resulting fact that `v` generates `M`). -/

/-- **Every weight of a finite-dimensional highest weight module has a dominant integral Weyl
conjugate, again a weight of the module.** Here `M` is a module over an algebraically closed field
of characteristic zero, generated by a highest weight vector of weight `lam`, and `M` is not

The weights of a finite-dimensional module form a Weyl-stable set
(`EpsilonEridani.formalCharacter_coeff_weylGroup_smul`) of integral weights
(`EpsilonEridani.isIntegralWeight_of_formalCharacter_coeff_ne_zero`), and for a highest weight module they
lie below the highest weight; that is exactly the input of
`EpsilonEridani.exists_weylGroup_smul_dominant_of_forall_reflection_mem_of_sub_mem_posRootCone`. -/
