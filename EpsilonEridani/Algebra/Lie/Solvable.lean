# Solvability along Lie homomorphisms, the radical of a quotient, and ideals inside an ideal

Mathlib transports solvability of a Lie algebra along injective and surjective homomorphisms and
shows that a sum of two solvable ideals is solvable, but it does not record the third and most
frequently used closure property: solvability is an *extension* property.  A Lie algebra with a
solvable ideal whose quotient is solvable is itself solvable.  This file proves that, in the
sharper form that an ideal is solvable as soon as its image under some homomorphism is solvable
and the part of it inside the kernel is, and draws the consequence that the solvable radical is
carried onto the solvable radical by a surjective homomorphism with solvable kernel.

A last section changes direction and looks inside an ideal rather than along a homomorphism. An
ideal `J` of `L` contained in an ideal `I` is also an ideal of the Lie algebra `↥I`, namely
`LieIdeal.restrict I J`, the preimage of `J` under the inclusion `I ↪ L`; the two readings have
the same elements, so `J` is trivial exactly when its reading inside `I` is, and it is solvable
exactly when that reading is. Consequently a solvable ideal of `L` lying inside an ideal with
trivial radical is trivial (`LieIdeal.eq_bot_of_le_of_isSolvable`), which is how a semisimplicity
hypothesis on one ideal constrains the radical of the whole algebra.

The headline corollary is that the quotient of a Noetherian Lie algebra by its radical has
trivial radical, so that the radical is the unique solvable ideal with that property.  In
characteristic zero, where `LieAlgebra.HasTrivialRadical` is Cartan's criterion for
semisimplicity, this is the statement that `L ⧸ radical R L` is semisimple: the first step of the
structure theory, and the missing input for identifying the radical of a scalar extension of `L`
with the scalar extension of its radical.

Everything is phrased through `LieAlgebra.derivedSeriesOfIdeal`, the derived series of an ideal
computed inside the ambient algebra, because the type `↥I` makes images and preimages awkward.
Mathlib already relates the two readings through `LieIdeal.derivedSeries_eq_bot_iff`, and the
two new transport lemmas below are the exact analogues for a general starting ideal of Mathlib's
`LieIdeal.derivedSeries_map_le` and `LieIdeal.derivedSeries_map_eq`, which treat the case of the
whole algebra.

## Main statements

* `LieIdeal.derivedSeriesOfIdeal_map_le` and `LieIdeal.derivedSeriesOfIdeal_map_eq`: the derived
  series of an ideal maps into, and for a surjective homomorphism onto, the derived series of the
  image.
* `LieIdeal.isSolvable_map`: the image of a solvable ideal under a surjective homomorphism is
  solvable.
* `LieIdeal.isSolvable_of_isSolvable_map`: solvability descends from the image together with the
  part of the ideal lying in the kernel.
* `LieAlgebra.isSolvable_of_isSolvable_ker_of_surjective` and
  `LieAlgebra.isSolvable_iff_ideal_quotient`: solvability is an extension property.
* `LieIdeal.radical_map_eq`: a surjective homomorphism with solvable kernel carries the radical
  onto the radical.
* `LieIdeal.restrict`: an ideal of `L` read as an ideal of an ideal `I` of `L`, with
  `LieIdeal.restrict_eq_bot_iff` and `LieIdeal.isSolvable_restrict_iff` saying that for `J ≤ I`
  the two readings are trivial, respectively solvable, together, and
  `LieIdeal.eq_bot_of_le_of_isSolvable`: **a solvable ideal inside an ideal with trivial radical
  is trivial**.
* `LieAlgebra.hasTrivialRadical_of_equiv`: triviality of the radical transfers along an
  isomorphism of Lie algebras.
* `LieAlgebra.hasTrivialRadical_quotient_radical`: **the quotient of a Noetherian Lie algebra by
  its radical has trivial radical**, with `LieAlgebra.radical_le_of_hasTrivialRadical_quotient`
  and `LieAlgebra.hasTrivialRadical_quotient_iff`: the radical is the smallest ideal, and the
  only solvable one, whose quotient has trivial radical.
