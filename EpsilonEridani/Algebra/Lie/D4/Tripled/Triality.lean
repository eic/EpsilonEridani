# Triality on the tripled type-D4 carrier

The order-three symmetry of the Bourbaki-numbered `D₄` diagram, `EpsilonEridani.trialityPermD4`, fixes
the central node and cycles the three outer nodes, and with them the three eight-dimensional
representations `V(ϖ₁)`, `V(ϖ₃)` and `V(ϖ₄)`. On the tripled weight table it is the symmetry
`EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.trialitySymmetry`, and on the rational tripled module the coordinate
permutation `EpsilonEridani.MinusculeWeightTable.Symmetry.moduleEquiv` of that symmetry intertwines the
represented positive and negative simple-root generators. Every nonzero entry of a raising or
lowering matrix on the tripled weight basis is `1`, so no signs are needed: the lift permutes the
lattice basis with every scaling coefficient equal to one. This file descends that lift to the
tripled carrier through the numbered-symmetry construction on Kostant toral closures.

The resulting automorphism `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.trialityAutomorphism` carries each numbered root
subgroup to the subgroup numbered by triality, without changing its additive parameter, and
carries the represented split torus to itself, relabelling its coordinates by the inverse of the
diagram permutation: `weightTorus ≫ γ.hom = relabel σ⁻¹ ≫ weightTorus`, a distinction that
matters for a permutation of order three. It has order dividing three. On matrix-valued points it
is conjugation by the permutation matrix of `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.d4TripledTrialityPerm`, and that
matrix is compatible with every change of value ring.

No reductivity, maximality of the represented torus, or identification of the carrier with the
pinned simply connected group scheme of type `D₄` is asserted here.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.trialityAutomorphism`: the triality automorphism of the tripled carrier.
* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.rootSubgroup_comp_trialityAutomorphism_hom`: its action on the numbered
  simple-root subgroups, `γ ∘ x_k = x_{σ k}`.
* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.weightTorus_comp_trialityAutomorphism_hom`: its action on the split weight
  torus.
* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.trialityAutomorphism_pow_three`,
  `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.trialityAutomorphism_hom_comp_self_comp_self` and
  `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.trialityAutomorphism_inv`: its order-three relation on the carrier.
* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.trialityMatrix`: the permutation matrix inducing triality on points, with
  `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.map_trialityMatrix` its compatibility with ring homomorphisms.
* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.trialityPoints`: the same automorphism on matrix-valued points.
* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.trialityPoints_rootSubgroupPoints` and
  `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.trialityPoints_weightTorusPoints`: its pointwise equations on the numbered
  simple-root subgroups and the represented weight torus.
* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.schemePointsMulEquiv_trialityAutomorphism_comp_carrierι`: the action on
  scheme-valued points is conjugation by `trialityMatrix`.
* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.trialityPoints_pow_three` and `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.trialityPoints_symm_apply`:
  its pointwise order-three relation.
* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.pointsMap_comp_trialityPoints`: its naturality in the value ring, and so its
  commutation with every Frobenius map.
