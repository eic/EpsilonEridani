# The Frobenius of the tripled type-D4 carrier

The tripled type-`D₄` carrier is the explicit Kostant toral closure over `ℤ` built from the
`24`-dimensional representation `V(ϖ₁) ⊕ V(ϖ₃) ⊕ V(ϖ₄)` and its admissible full-weight lattice.
Over a commutative ring `A` of exponential characteristic `p`, entrywise `p ^ k`-th powers
preserve its defining Hopf ideal and therefore give a group endomorphism of its `A`-valued points.

This file names that endomorphism `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.frobenius` and records its characteristic
equations:

```text
F (g)ᵢⱼ = gᵢⱼ ^ (p ^ k),
F (xᵢ(u)) = xᵢ(u ^ (p ^ k)),
F (t(s)) = t(s ^ (p ^ k)).
```

The zeroth iterate is the identity, exponents add under composition and multiply under powers.
The fixed points are the points of the same carrier over the Frobenius-fixed subring. No
reductivity, finiteness, or simplicity statement is involved; no triality automorphism of the
carrier is constructed here, so no Steinberg map is formed, and the carrier is not identified
with the pinned simply connected group scheme of type `D₄`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.frobenius`: the `p ^ k`-power Frobenius on the carrier's points.
* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.frobenius_eq_pointsMap`: it is the map on points induced by the iterated
  Frobenius of the value ring.
* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.coe_frobenius` and `coe_frobenius_apply`: its matrix and entrywise actions.
* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.frobenius_rootSubgroupPoints`: its action on every numbered simple-root
  subgroup.
* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.frobenius_weightTorusPoints`: its action on the split weight torus.
* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.frobenius_zero`, `frobenius_add` and `frobenius_pow`: its iteration laws.
* `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.frobenius_eq_self_iff` and
  `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.map_subtype_fixedSubgroup_frobenius_eq`: which points it fixes, and the
  identification of the fixed subgroup with the points over the Frobenius-fixed subring.
