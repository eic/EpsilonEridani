# The left-regular representation of a Lie map into an associative algebra

Let `q : L →ₗ⁅R⁆ A` be a Lie algebra map from `L` into an associative `R`-algebra `A`, the latter
bracketed by its ring commutator. Left multiplication by the image of `q` makes `A` itself a
representation of `L`:

`x • a = q x * a`.

This is the *left-regular* action along `q`, and it is a different `L`-module from the inner
derivation action `x • a = ⁅q x, a⁆` that `LieAlgebra.ad` supplies; the two differ by right
multiplication (`LieHom.ad_apply_eq_leftRegularRep_sub_mulRight`), and only the left-regular one
has the left ideals of `A` among its submodules. Kostant's isotypy theorem is a statement about
the left-regular action of a semisimple Lie algebra on the Clifford algebra of its Killing form,
so this file supplies the general construction that specialization needs.

Because the module structure it defines competes with the self-module structure of `A` as a Lie
ring, the action is packaged as a homomorphism `L →ₗ⁅R⁆ Module.End R A` rather than as an
instance: a consumer installs the associated `LieRingModule` where it wants it, with
`LieRingModule.compLieHom`.

## Main definitions

* `LieHom.leftRegularRep`: the left-regular representation `L →ₗ⁅R⁆ Module.End R A` along `q`.

## Main results

* `LieHom.leftRegularRep_apply`: it acts by left multiplication.
* `LieHom.leftRegularRep_injective_iff`: it is faithful exactly when `q` is injective, because
  left multiplication determines the multiplier.
* `LieHom.leftRegularRep_comp_mulRight`: right multiplications are intertwiners of the
  left-regular representation; this is the commutant that makes the isotypy arguments run.
* `LieHom.leftRegularRep_mem_of_mem`: every left ideal of `A` is invariant.
* `LieHom.ad_apply_eq_leftRegularRep_sub_mulRight`: the inner derivation action is the difference
  of the left-regular action and right multiplication.

/-- **The left-regular representation along a Lie map into an associative algebra.** The Lie
algebra `L` acts on `A` by left multiplication by the image of `q`, which is a Lie action because
`q` turns the bracket of `L` into the ring commutator of `A`. -/

/-- **The left-regular representation is faithful exactly when `q` is injective.** It is the
composite of `q` with `Algebra.lmul`, and left multiplication determines the multiplier
(`Algebra.lmul_injective`), so no information is lost in passing to left multiplications. -/

associativity of `A`, read as the statement that the right multiplications lie in the commutant of
the image of `leftRegularRep q`. -/
