# The trace twist of a `gl n`-module, and every dominant weight as a highest weight

Dominance for `gl n` constrains only the consecutive *differences* of a weight
(`EpsilonEridani.IsGlDominantIntegral`), so the dominant weights are the antitone tuples of natural
numbers translated along the central direction `μ ↦ μ + c · (1, …, 1)`, with `c` a free scalar.
`EpsilonEridani.exists_isGlHighestWeightVector_natCast` realizes the natural-number weights as highest
weights inside exterior powers; this file supplies the central direction and, with it, **every**
dominant weight.

## The twist

The trace is a Lie character of `gl n`: it is linear and kills every commutator
(`LieAlgebra.matrix_trace_commutator_zero`). So for a scalar `c` and a `gl n`-module `M` the
formula

`⁅A, m⁆' = ⁅A, m⁆ + c · tr(A) · m`

is again a `gl n`-module structure on the underlying `R`-module of `M`. It is carried by
`EpsilonEridani.GlTraceTwist n c M`, a copy of `M` with the same `R`-module structure and the displayed
bracket; `EpsilonEridani.GlTraceTwist.linearEquiv` is that identification of the underlying `R`-modules,
and `EpsilonEridani.GlTraceTwist.ofTwist_lie` is the defining equation of the bracket.

Since `tr(Eᵢᵢ) = 1` and `tr(Eᵢⱼ) = 0` for `i ≠ j`, twisting shifts the weight of a highest weight
vector by `c` in every coordinate and changes nothing else
(`EpsilonEridani.isGlHighestWeightVector_toTwist`). No invertibility of the size of the matrices is
needed: the shift is read off the diagonal matrix units, not off the identity matrix.

## Every dominant weight is a highest weight

A dominant weight `μ : Fin N → R` is `a + c` for an antitone `a : Fin N → ℕ` and a scalar `c`, by
`EpsilonEridani.IsGlDominantIntegral.exists_antitone_natCast_add_const` in
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/GeneralLinear/HighestWeight.lean`. Twisting the exterior-power realization of
`a` by `c` then realizes `μ`, which is
`EpsilonEridani.exists_isGlHighestWeightVector_of_isGlDominantIntegral`. The realizing module
`EpsilonEridani.glTraceTwistedYoungWedge` is finite over `R`, hence finite-dimensional over a field.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.GlTraceTwist`: a `gl n`-module twisted by the character `c · tr`.
* `EpsilonEridani.GlTraceTwist.linearEquiv`: the underlying `R`-modules of a module and of its twist.
* `EpsilonEridani.glTraceTwistedYoungWedge`: the trace twist by `c` of the exterior power in which
  `EpsilonEridani.exists_isGlHighestWeightVector_natCast` realizes a tuple `a` of natural numbers; for an
  antitone `a` it carries a highest weight vector of the dominant weight `a + c · (1, …, 1)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.glTraceTwistedYoungWedge.linearEquiv`: the underlying `R`-module of that carrier is the
  exterior power it twists.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GlTraceTwist.ofTwist_lie`: the defining equation of the twisted bracket.
* `EpsilonEridani.isGlHighestWeightVector_toTwist_iff` and its introduction half
  `EpsilonEridani.isGlHighestWeightVector_toTwist`: twisting by `c` shifts the weight of a highest weight
  vector by `c` in every coordinate, and nothing else;
  `EpsilonEridani.glTraceTwistedYoungWedge.isGlHighestWeightVector_linearEquiv_symm` is that introduction
  rule for the named carrier.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_isGlHighestWeightVector_of_isGlDominantIntegral`: **every dominant weight of
  `gl N` is the highest weight of a highest weight vector in a module finite over `R`.**

## Implementation notes

Twisting by the trace loses no generality. A Lie character of `gl ι` in the sense of
`LieAlgebra.LieCharacter` vanishes on the derived ideal
(`LieAlgebra.lieCharacter_apply_of_mem_derived`), which is the trace-zero ideal
(`EpsilonEridani.derivedSeries_one_eq_slIdeal`); since a matrix differs from a multiple of a single
diagonal matrix unit by a trace-zero matrix, every character of `gl ι` is `c · tr` for a nonempty
`ι`. So the scalar `c` is a coordinate on the characters, and the twist below is the twist by an
arbitrary one.

`EpsilonEridani.GlTraceTwist` is a one-field structure rather than a bare type synonym, so that the
twisting data `ι` and `c` are honest parameters of the carrier; the module structures are
transported along the resulting equivalence. This is the pattern of Mathlib's `WithLp`, which
carries a phantom exponent in the same way.

## Roadmap context

Layer 9 of the
[highest weight roadmap](https://github.com/EpsilonEridaniProject/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/blob/main/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md)
asks for a finite-dimensional irreducible `gl n`-module for each dominant weight, the entries of a
dominant weight being free scalars and only their differences constrained. The existence input for
the weights with natural number entries is
`EpsilonEridani.exists_isGlHighestWeightVector_natCast`; this file supplies the remaining central
direction, so that the existence half of that classification reaches every dominant weight.
Cutting the realizing module down to an irreducible one, and naming the resulting carrier, is not
done here.

/-- **The trace twist** of a `gl ι`-module `M` by a scalar `c`: a copy of `M` with the same
`R`-module structure and with the bracket `⁅A, m⁆ + c · tr(A) · m`. It is again a `gl ι`-module
because the trace is a Lie character, that is, a linear form killing every commutator.

`EpsilonEridani.GlTraceTwist.linearEquiv` identifies the underlying `R`-modules and
`EpsilonEridani.GlTraceTwist.ofTwist_lie` computes the twisted bracket, so that the twist is used through
its API rather than through the wrapper. -/

directions; conversely a highest weight vector of the twist that comes from `M` has a weight of that
shape, with `c` subtracted back off. This is how a twisted highest weight hypothesis is eliminated,
without unfolding the bracket. -/
