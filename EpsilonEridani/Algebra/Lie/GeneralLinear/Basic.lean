# The centre and the derived ideal of `gl n R`

The general linear Lie algebra `gl n R` is `Matrix n n R` with the commutator bracket. It is the
basic *reductive* — as opposed to semisimple — example: it splits as its centre plus its derived
ideal as soon as `Fintype.card n` is invertible in `R`. This file identifies both pieces.

The centre of `gl n R` is the scalar matrices, for any commutative ring `R` and any finite index
type. The derived ideal `⁅gl n R, gl n R⁆` is the trace-zero ideal `sl n R`, again over any
commutative ring and any finite index type: one inclusion is the vanishing of the trace of a
commutator, and the other writes a trace-zero matrix as a combination of the commutators
`Eᵢⱼ = ⁅Eᵢᵢ, Eᵢⱼ⁆` (for `i ≠ j`) and `Eᵢᵢ - Eⱼⱼ = ⁅Eᵢⱼ, Eⱼᵢ⁆`.

The two pieces are complementary whenever the size of the matrices is invertible in `R`: the
intersection is cut out by `Fintype.card n * r = 0`, and the projection onto the centre divides the
trace by `Fintype.card n`. Under that hypothesis `gl n R` is the direct sum of its centre and its
derived ideal, which is the linear half of the reductivity criterion `radical = center`. Only this
sufficiency is proved here; the hypothesis is not necessary in general, since for an empty index
type `gl n R` is the zero Lie algebra and the decomposition is vacuous. It cannot simply be dropped
either: over `ZMod p` the identity matrix of `gl p (ZMod p)` has trace zero, so there the centre
sits *inside* the derived ideal and the two are not complementary.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.slIdeal R n`: the trace-zero matrices, as a `LieIdeal R (Matrix n n R)`. Mathlib's
  `LieAlgebra.SpecialLinear.sl n R` is the same subspace packaged only as a Lie subalgebra, and
  `EpsilonEridani.slIdeal_toLieSubalgebra_eq_sl` identifies the two.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.mem_of_trace_eq_zero_of_single_mem`: a submodule of `gl n R` containing the off-diagonal
  matrix units and the differences of the diagonal ones contains every trace-zero matrix. This is
  the spanning core shared by the derived-ideal computation below and by the ideal-generation
  argument of `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/GeneralLinear/Radical.lean`.
* `EpsilonEridani.mem_center_matrix_iff`: an element of `gl n R` is central exactly when it is a scalar
  matrix; `EpsilonEridani.one_mem_center_matrix` records that the identity is central, and
  `EpsilonEridani.center_matrix_toSubmodule_eq_span_one` records the centre as the span of `1`.
* `EpsilonEridani.derivedSeries_one_eq_slIdeal`: the derived ideal of `gl n R` is `EpsilonEridani.slIdeal R n`, so
  by `EpsilonEridani.mem_slIdeal_iff` it consists of the trace-zero matrices, and
  `EpsilonEridani.derivedSeries_one_toLieSubalgebra_eq_sl` reads this as `LieAlgebra.SpecialLinear.sl n R`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isCompl_center_derivedSeries_one_matrix`: when `Fintype.card n` is invertible in `R`,
  the centre and the derived ideal are complementary submodules of `gl n R`.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_sl_add_smul_one_eq`: every matrix is a trace-zero matrix plus a scalar matrix
  when the cardinality is a unit, with the empty case included.
* `EpsilonEridani.derivedSeries_one_matrix_ne_top`: for nonempty `n` over a nontrivial `R`, `gl n R` is
  not perfect.
* `EpsilonEridani.not_hasTrivialRadical_matrix`: for nonempty `n` over a nontrivial `R`, `gl n R` is not
  semisimple, since its centre is then a nonzero abelian ideal (`EpsilonEridani.center_matrix_ne_bot`).

## Implementation notes

Every result about `gl n R` is stated over an arbitrary commutative ring `R`; no field,
characteristic, or algebraic closure hypothesis is used. The bundled complement carries
invertibility of `Fintype.card n` as an `Invertible` hypothesis, while its elementwise consequence
asks only that the cardinality be a unit when the index type is nonempty. Two groups of
declarations ask for less: the matrix-unit bracket identities and the spanning theorem for
trace-zero matrices need only a ring, and the decomposition of a trace-zero matrix into matrix units
needs only an additive commutative group, no multiplication at all.

Mathlib does not register `LieRing.ofAssociativeRing` as a global instance, so, as in
`Mathlib/Algebra/Lie/Matrix.lean`, it is a local instance here.

## References

This implements the concrete `gl n` half of the opening "structure of reductive Lie algebras"
target of Layer 9 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md`: *"Concretely
for `gl_n`: the centre is the scalar matrices, the derived ideal is `sl n`"*, together with the
direct-sum statement into which the reductivity criterion quoted there splits.

/-- **A trace-zero matrix as a sum of commutator-shaped matrix units.** Every matrix is the sum of
its matrix units `Eₚq (Aₚq)`; subtracting `E₀₀ (Aₚₚ)` from each diagonal one changes the total by
`E₀₀ (trace A)`, so for a trace-zero `A` the corrected sum is still `A`.

The correction is what puts each summand in commutator form: the membership helper below exhibits
an explicit bracket for every one of them. Only the additive structure of `R` is involved here. -/
