# Restricting representations between `gl n` and `sl n`

As soon as the rank is invertible in the field of scalars, `gl n` is the sum of `sl n` and the
scalar matrices. This file uses that decomposition in both directions needed by highest-weight
theory: an irreducible `gl n` module stays irreducible on restriction to `sl n`, and an equivalence
of `sl n`-modules upgrades to an equivalence of `gl n`-modules when the identity matrix acts by the
same scalar on both modules.

The invertibility is asked for as `n ≠ 0 → (n : K) ≠ 0`, which is what the decomposition needs and
no more: for positive rank it is supplied by
`EpsilonEridani.isCompl_center_derivedSeries_one_matrix`, while in rank zero every matrix is zero and
nothing is needed. Characteristic zero is one way to have it, and the results stated over such a
field discharge it themselves.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isIrreducible_restrict_sl_of_forall_one_lie_eq_smul`: restriction of an irreducible
  `gl n` module to `sl n` is irreducible as soon as the identity matrix acts by a scalar, and
  `EpsilonEridani.isIrreducible_restrict_sl_of_isGlHighestWeightVector` reads that scalar off a highest
  weight vector.
* `EpsilonEridani.isIrreducible_restrict_sl`: over an algebraically closed field Schur's lemma supplies
  that scalar, so a finite-dimensional irreducible `gl n` module restricts irreducibly.
* `EpsilonEridani.gl_equiv_of_sl_equiv_of_central_scalar`: an `sl n`-module equivalence between two
  modules with the same scalar action of the identity matrix is a `gl n`-module equivalence.
