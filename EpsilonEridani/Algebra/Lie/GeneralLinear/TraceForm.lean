# The trace form of `gl n R` and the anticommutation relations it induces

The general linear Lie algebra `gl n R` is `Matrix n n R` with the commutator bracket. Over a
field of characteristic zero, and for nonempty finite `n`, it is reductive rather than semisimple
(in characteristic `p` it need not even be that: for `n` of cardinality `2` in characteristic `2`,
`sl n` is a solvable ideal strictly larger than the centre). Whatever the characteristic, and again
for nonempty `n` over a nontrivial ring, its Killing form is degenerate: the identity matrix is
central and nonzero, so it lies in the radical of every invariant form built from the adjoint
representation. The form that replaces it is the trace form of the *standard* representation,
`⟨X, Y⟩ = trace (X * Y)`.

That motivation is what singles the form out; none of the hypotheses behind it are needed to build
it. The trace form is symmetric and nondegenerate over an arbitrary commutative semiring and an
arbitrary finite index type, and invariant for the commutator bracket as soon as `R` is a
commutative ring.

This file builds that form, both as a bilinear form (`EpsilonEridani.traceBilinForm`) and as the quadratic
form `X ↦ trace (X * X)` (`EpsilonEridani.traceQuadraticForm`), whose Clifford algebra is the one carrying
the anticommutation relations below, and records the three facts a Clifford construction consumes:
the polar form is `2 • ⟨·, ·⟩`, the form is nondegenerate once `2` is invertible, and the adjoint
action lands in the skew-adjoint endomorphisms of the polar form.

The factors of two are then pinned once and for all on the matrix units. Writing `d_ij` for
`ι (Eᵢⱼ)`, the Clifford relation `ι v * ι v = Q v` polarizes to the anticommutation relations
`d_ij d_kl + d_kl d_ij = 2 δ_jk δ_li`, `d_ij d_ij = δ_ij`.
These are relations in the Clifford algebra of the trace form, and nothing beyond that is claimed of
them here. Reading them, as the roadmap does, as the relations of a CAR algebra would need a
splitting of the generators into creation and annihilation operators, an involution, and an
identification of this Clifford algebra with a CAR algebra; none of that is supplied.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.traceBilinForm R n`: the bilinear form `(X, Y) ↦ trace (X * Y)` on `Matrix n n R`.
* `EpsilonEridani.traceQuadraticForm R n`: the quadratic form `X ↦ trace (X * X)`, the form whose
  Clifford algebra carries the anticommutation relations below.
* `EpsilonEridani.traceAdjointSO R n`: the adjoint homomorphism of `gl n R` read into the skew-adjoint
  endomorphisms of the polar form of `EpsilonEridani.traceQuadraticForm R n`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.traceBilinForm_lieInvariant`: the trace form is invariant, by cyclicity of the trace.
* `EpsilonEridani.traceBilinForm_nondegenerate`: it is nondegenerate over any commutative semiring, a
  matrix being determined by the traces of its products.
* `EpsilonEridani.polarBilin_traceQuadraticForm`: the polar form of the trace quadratic form is
  `2 * trace (X * Y)`, the normalization the roadmap pins;
  `EpsilonEridani.polarBilin_traceQuadraticForm_eq_two_smul` is the same statement as an equality of
  bilinear forms, `2 • traceBilinForm`.
* `EpsilonEridani.traceQuadraticForm_nondegenerate`: the quadratic form is nondegenerate when `2` is
  invertible.
* `EpsilonEridani.traceQuadraticForm_ι_mul_ι_add_swap`: the anticommutation relation
  `ι X ι Y + ι Y ι X = 2 trace (X * Y)` for arbitrary generators, of which
  `EpsilonEridani.traceQuadraticForm_ι_single_mul_ι_single_add_swap`, the anticommutation relations
  `d_ij d_kl + d_kl d_ij = 2 δ_jk δ_li` on the matrix units, is the specialization; and
  `EpsilonEridani.traceQuadraticForm_ι_single_mul_self`: the squares `d_ij d_ij = δ_ij`.
* `EpsilonEridani.carGenerator`: the opaque public matrix-unit generator used by the CAR consumers,
  together with its generator-level anticommutation and square equations.

## Implementation notes

The roadmap pins these declarations over `ℂ` for `Matrix (Fin N) (Fin N) ℂ`. Nothing in the
statements or proofs asks for that: the form, its symmetry and its nondegeneracy are stated over an
arbitrary commutative semiring and an arbitrary finite index type, exactly as for the Killing form
in `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/SkewAdjoint.lean`. Additive inverses are assumed only where the
construction being made needs them: the commutator bracket, `QuadraticMap.polarBilin` and
`CliffordAlgebra` are all available only over a `CommRing`, so the invariance, polar-form, adjoint
and anticommutation declarations carry `[CommRing R]`. Only the transfer of nondegeneracy from the
bilinear form to the quadratic form asks for an invertible `2`, carried as an `Invertible`
hypothesis on the single result that needs it.

Mathlib's `Algebra.traceForm R S` is the trace form of the *regular* representation of an algebra,
which on `Matrix n n R` is `Fintype.card n` times the form built here, so it is not a
reparametrization of it; and `LieModule.traceForm`, which does specialize to this form on the
standard representation, is unavailable without the non-instance
`LieRingModule.ofAssociativeModule`. The form is therefore assembled directly from
`Matrix.traceLinearMap` and `LinearMap.mul`.

The two steps that the trace form shares with the Killing form — the polar form of the quadratic
form of a symmetric `B` is `2 • B`, and nondegeneracy passes from `B` to that quadratic form once
`2` is invertible — are general facts about a bilinear form, stated once in
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/QuadraticForm/Radical.lean`
(`LinearMap.BilinMap.polarBilin_toQuadraticMap_of_flip` and
`LinearMap.BilinForm.Nondegenerate.toQuadraticMap`); the declarations here and their Killing
counterparts in `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/SkewAdjoint.lean` are applications of them.

Mathlib does not register `LieRing.ofAssociativeRing` as a global instance, so, as in
`Mathlib/Algebra/Lie/Matrix.lean`, it is a local instance here.
