# Highest weight vectors of `gl ι` from Young diagrams

Every weakly decreasing tuple of natural numbers is the weight of a highest weight vector in a
`gl ι`-module finite over the base ring. The module is a single exterior power, and the vector is
a wedge of standard basis vectors indexed by the cells of a Young diagram.

## The construction

Let `κ` index a second, auxiliary coordinate, so that `ι × κ → R` is the standard module of
`gl (ι × κ)` and `gl ι` acts on it through the block-diagonal map `EpsilonEridani.glBlockDiagonal`, which
sends `A` to `Matrix.blockDiagonal fun _ : κ => A`. Concretely the matrix unit `Eₛₜ` of `gl ι` goes
to the sum `∑ c, E₍ₛ,c₎₍ₜ,c₎` of the matrix units of `gl (ι × κ)` that move a cell from row `t` to
row `s` and leave its column alone (`EpsilonEridani.glBlockDiagonal_single`).

For a finite set of cells `D ⊆ ι × κ` the wedge `exteriorPower.basisWedge R D` of the standard
basis vectors `e_p`, `p ∈ D`, is then a weight vector for the diagonal: summing
`exteriorPower.lie_single_self_basisWedge` over the columns, `Eₛₛ` scales the wedge by the number
of cells of `D` in row `s`. And if `D` is a row lower set — containing with every cell the cells
directly above it, which is the closure in the row direction that the raising operators need —
then every raising operator `Eₛₜ` with `s < t` annihilates the wedge by
`exteriorPower.lie_single_basisWedge_eq_zero_of_ne_of_mem_imp_mem`, since moving a cell from row
`t` up to row `s` lands on a cell already present.

The weight read off this way is the row-length function of `D`. Taking `κ = Fin m` and `D` the
Young diagram `EpsilonEridani.CellDiagram.ofRowLens a m` of a weakly decreasing `a : ι → ℕ`, and taking
`m` with `∀ i, a i ≤ m`, the row lengths are the `a i` themselves, which realizes `a` as a highest
weight.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isGlHighestWeightVector_basisWedge`: **the wedge of a row lower set of cells is a
  highest weight vector**, of weight the row lengths of the set.
* `EpsilonEridani.isGlHighestWeightVector_basisWedge_ofRowLens` and
  `EpsilonEridani.exists_isGlHighestWeightVector_natCast`: **every weakly decreasing tuple of natural
  numbers is a highest weight** of a `gl ι`-module finite over `R`.

## Roadmap context

Layer 9 of the
[highest weight roadmap](https://github.com/EpsilonEridaniProject/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/blob/main/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md)
asks for the finite-dimensional irreducible `gl n`-module of each dominant weight.
`EpsilonEridani.exists_isGlHighestWeightVector_natCast` supplies highest weight vectors for the dominant
weights with natural number entries, the existence input to that classification;
`EpsilonEridani.nonempty_lieModuleEquiv_of_isGlHighestWeightVector` and
`EpsilonEridani.finrank_le_of_isGlHighestWeightVector` are the uniqueness half, already proved.

## Implementation notes

`EpsilonEridani.glBlockDiagonal` is the constant family map followed by `Matrix.blockDiagonalRingHom`,
promoted to an `AlgHom`, and then viewed as a `LieHom`. It need not be injective when `κ` is empty,
so it is a map rather than an embedding.

A single-column diagram gives back the fundamental weights: for `κ` a singleton, the row lower
set of the first `d` rows is the wedge `exteriorPower.firstBasisWedge`, transported along
`ι × κ ≃ ι`. The two are not literally the same declaration because the ambient index types differ,
and it is the second coordinate — absent there — that lets a row be repeated, which is what a
general weakly decreasing tuple needs.

The cells of a diagram are wedged together in the order `exteriorPower.basisWedge` reads off the
linear order on `ι × κ`, and that order is a parameter of the results below: nothing depends on the
choice, since a different order permutes the factors and changes the wedge by a sign, which affects
neither being nonzero nor being a highest weight vector. Only
`EpsilonEridani.exists_isGlHighestWeightVector_natCast`, which has to produce a witness, picks one, and it
picks the lexicographic order, supplied as a local instance.
