# Derivations and powers of ideals

A derivation that preserves two ideals also preserves their product: the Leibniz rule
places its two summands in the product by differentiating one factor at a time. Consequently, a
derivation preserving an ideal preserves every power of that ideal.

The stronger condition that the whole range of a derivation lies in an ideal automatically gives
the required stability: a derivation taking values in an ideal `I` preserves every power `I ^ n`.
An ideal here is a left ideal; when `I` is moreover two-sided, so is each `I ^ n`, and the
derivation then descends to the quotient by that power along `EpsilonEridani.derivationQuotientHom`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.mem_stableDerivations_mul`: a derivation preserving two ideals preserves their product.
* `EpsilonEridani.mem_stableDerivations_pow`: a derivation preserving an ideal preserves all its powers.
* `EpsilonEridani.mem_stableDerivations_pow_of_range_le`: if the range of a derivation lies in an ideal,
  every power of that ideal is stable under the derivation.

## Implementation notes

Stability is phrased throughout as membership in the Lie subalgebra `EpsilonEridani.stableDerivations`,
the form in which `EpsilonEridani.derivationQuotientHom` consumes it, rather than as a bare `Set.MapsTo`.
The stabilizer is indexed by a submodule over the base ring, so an ideal `I` of `A` enters it as
`I.restrictScalars R`.
