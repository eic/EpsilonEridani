# Derivations on quotient algebras

A derivation of an associative algebra descends to a quotient by a two-sided ideal exactly when
it preserves that ideal. This file constructs that descent, out of the Lie subalgebra
`EpsilonEridani.stableDerivations` of derivations preserving the ideal, as a homomorphism of Lie algebras

`Der(A, I) → Der(A ⧸ I)`.

The Lie-algebra packaging records that sums, scalar multiples, and commutators of derivations
preserving `I` still preserve `I`. It lets a Lie algebra acting on `A` by derivations descend its
action to `A ⧸ I` as soon as stability of `I` has been proved. In particular, derivations of a
universal enveloping algebra can act on the finite quotients used to extend Lie representations.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.derivationQuotientHom`: descent of stable derivations to the quotient algebra.
* `EpsilonEridani.stableInnerDerivation`: the inner derivations, as a homomorphism of Lie algebras into
  the derivations preserving a two-sided ideal.

## Implementation notes

The stabilizer `EpsilonEridani.stableDerivations` of a submodule only uses the module structure of `A`,
so it belongs to the core derivation API alongside `derivationLieAlgebra`; this file specialises
it to `I.restrictScalars R` for a two-sided ideal `I`. Descent itself is Mathlib's action of a Lie
algebra on the quotient of a Lie module by a stable Lie submodule,
`LieSubmodule.Quotient.actionAsEndoMap`, with its codomain cut down to the derivations of `A ⧸ I`,
in the same way that `innerDerivation` cuts down `LieAlgebra.ad`.
