# The Killing property as nondegeneracy of the Killing form

`LieAlgebra.IsKilling R L` is stated as the vanishing of the Killing orthogonal complement of the
whole algebra. Mathlib turns that into nondegeneracy of the Killing form in
`LieAlgebra.IsKilling.killingForm_nondegenerate`; this file supplies the converse and packages the
two as an equivalence, saying that `LieAlgebra.IsKilling` is exactly nondegeneracy of the Killing
form. That is the form in which the property is recognised when it is produced by a computation
with the form itself, as under base change.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.isKilling_of_ker_killingForm_eq_bot`: a Lie algebra whose Killing form has trivial
  kernel is Killing.
* `EpsilonEridani.isKilling_of_killingForm_nondegenerate`: a Lie algebra whose Killing form is
  nondegenerate is Killing.
* `EpsilonEridani.isKilling_iff_killingForm_nondegenerate`: `LieAlgebra.IsKilling` is exactly
  nondegeneracy of the Killing form.

## Roadmap

This supports `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/Killing/BaseChange.lean`, a prerequisite for Layer 9 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`, the Chevalley--Demazure construction.

## References

* J. E. Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory*, §5.1, for the Killing
  form and Cartan's criterion.
