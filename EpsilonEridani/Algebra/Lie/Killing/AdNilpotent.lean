# An ad-nilpotent element of a Killing Lie algebra is a bracket with itself

Let `L` be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field whose Killing form `κ` is nondegenerate,
and let `x : L` be an element whose adjoint action `ad x` is nilpotent.  Then there is a `t : L`
with

`⁅x, t⁆ = x`,

which is `EpsilonEridani.exists_lie_eq_self_of_isNilpotent_ad`.  Equivalently `⁅t, x⁆ = -x`, so when `x`
is nonzero it is an eigenvector of `ad t` for the eigenvalue `-1`.

The proof is the Killing-orthogonality of the kernel and the range of `ad x`, and it needs no
algebraically closed field, no Cartan subalgebra, and no `sl₂`-triple.  In two steps:

* **`x` is Killing-orthogonal to `ker (ad x)`.**  If `⁅x, z⁆ = 0` then `ad x` and `ad z` commute,
  so `ad x ∘ ad z` is nilpotent and its trace `κ x z` vanishes.  Only reducedness of the
  coefficients is used, and the statement is proved for the trace form of an arbitrary
  representation (`EpsilonEridani.traceForm_eq_zero_of_isNilpotent_of_lie_eq_zero`), the Killing form
  being the trace form of the adjoint representation.
* **The Killing-orthogonal complement of `range (ad x)` is `ker (ad x)`.**  This is invariance,
  `κ ⁅x, z⁆ y = - κ z ⁅x, y⁆`: the left-hand side vanishes for every `z` exactly when `⁅x, y⁆` is
  Killing-orthogonal to everything, which by nondegeneracy means `⁅x, y⁆ = 0`.  On a
  finite-dimensional space a nondegenerate symmetric form is reflexive and its double orthogonal
  complement is the original subspace, so `range (ad x)` is in turn the orthogonal complement of
  `ker (ad x)`, and the first step places `x` in it.

Nondegeneracy is what carries the argument: in an abelian Lie algebra every `ad x` is nilpotent
while `range (ad x)` is `⊥`, so no nonzero `x` is a bracket with itself there.  The hypothesis is
satisfied, nonvacuously, by every root vector of a split semisimple Lie algebra, which is
ad-nilpotent by `LieAlgebra.isNilpotent_ad_of_mem_rootSpace`.  For such a vector `e` the
conclusion is also visible in an `sl₂`-triple `(h, e, f)` over a field in which `2 ≠ 0`, since
`⁅h, e⁆ = 2 • e` then gives `t = -(2 : K)⁻¹ • h`; that route is genuinely characteristic-dependent,
and it fails in characteristic two.  What is proved here needs no triple, no Cartan subalgebra, no
root space decomposition, no triangularizability and no invertible `2`, only ad-nilpotence of `x`
and nondegeneracy of `κ`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.orthogonal_range_ad_eq_ker_ad` and `EpsilonEridani.range_ad_eq_orthogonal_ker_ad`: **the
  kernel and the range of `ad x` are each other's Killing-orthogonal complements.**
* `EpsilonEridani.mem_range_ad_self_of_isNilpotent_ad`: **an ad-nilpotent element lies in the range of
  its own adjoint action.**
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_lie_eq_self_of_isNilpotent_ad`: **hence `⁅x, t⁆ = x` for some `t`.**
