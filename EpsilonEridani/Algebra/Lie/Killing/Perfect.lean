# A Lie algebra with nondegenerate Killing form is perfect

A finite-dimensional Lie algebra `L` whose Killing form `κ` is nondegenerate satisfies
`⁅L, L⁆ = L`. The proof is a two-line use of the invariance `κ ⁅x, y⁆ z = κ x ⁅y, z⁆`: a linear
form vanishing on the derived ideal is `κ x` for a unique `x`, and then `κ ⁅x, y⁆ z = κ x ⁅y, z⁆`
vanishes for all `z`, so `x` is central; a central element of a Killing algebra is zero, so the
form is zero and the derived ideal was already everything.

The statement is recorded here in the form its consumers use: an action of `L` that composes to
zero is itself zero (`EpsilonEridani.isTrivial_of_derivedSeries_one_eq_top_of_lie_lie_eq_zero`), which is
what turns a two-step filtration of a module into a trivial action. This is the step that rules
out the degenerate case in the Casimir proof of Weyl's complete reducibility theorem, where a
module `M` with `⁅L, M⁆ ⊆ N` and `N` acted on trivially would otherwise escape the argument.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.derivedSeries_one_eq_top_of_isKilling`: **a Lie algebra with nondegenerate Killing form
  is perfect.**
* `EpsilonEridani.isTrivial_of_derivedSeries_one_eq_top_of_lie_lie_eq_zero`: over a perfect Lie algebra,
  a module on which the action composes to zero is a trivial module.

## References

* J. E. Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory*, GTM 9, §5.2, where
  perfectness is deduced from the decomposition of a semisimple Lie algebra into simple ideals;
  the argument here uses only the nondegeneracy and the invariance of the Killing form.

/-- **A Lie algebra with nondegenerate Killing form is perfect**: `⁅L, L⁆ = L`.

A linear form killing the derived ideal is `κ x` for some `x`, by nondegeneracy of the Killing
form on a finite-dimensional space. Invariance turns `κ x ⁅y, z⁆ = 0` into `κ ⁅x, y⁆ z = 0` for
all `z`, so `⁅x, y⁆ = 0` for every `y`; then `ad x = 0`, so `κ x` vanishes identically and `x = 0`.
The linear form was therefore zero, which contradicts the properness of the derived ideal. -/
