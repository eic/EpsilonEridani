# The Killing property under base change

`LieAlgebra.IsKilling R L` says that the Killing form of `L` is nonsingular. This file proves that
for a finite free Lie algebra over an integral domain the property descends along any base change
into a second integral domain, and that an injective base change loses nothing either:

```text
IsKilling A (A ⊗[R] L) → IsKilling R L,  and  IsKilling A (A ⊗[R] L) ↔ IsKilling R L.
```

Both halves are useful. The descent direction transports the Killing property *down* from a
large coefficient ring to a small one, which is what a construction over `ℚ` needs when the
available theorem is stated over an algebraically closed field; it asks nothing of the structure
map, so it also covers reduction `ℤ → 𝔽ₚ`. The ascent direction transports the property *up*,
which is what a base-changed Lie algebra needs before Mathlib's `IsKilling` machinery applies to
it, and there injectivity is genuinely needed.

The mathematical content is entirely in the Gram matrix. Mathlib's `LieModule.traceForm_baseChange`
already says that the Killing form of `A ⊗[R] L` is the base change of the Killing form of `L`, and
`EpsilonEridani.nondegenerate_of_nondegenerate_baseChange` and
`EpsilonEridani.nondegenerate_baseChange_iff` say how a base change of integral domains reflects
and preserves nondegeneracy of a bilinear form on a finite free module. What remains is to read
`IsKilling` as nondegeneracy of the Killing form in both directions;
`EpsilonEridani.isKilling_of_killingForm_nondegenerate` is the direction Mathlib does not already provide.

Nothing here needs the coefficients to be a field, and no characteristic hypothesis appears: the
counterexamples to `HasTrivialRadical → IsKilling` in positive characteristic concern the passage
between semisimplicity and the Killing property, not the base change of the Killing form itself.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.isKilling_of_isKilling_baseChange`: the Killing property descends along any base change
  of integral domains, in the form a consumer holding a theorem over a larger coefficient ring
  applies.
* `EpsilonEridani.isKilling_baseChange_iff`: along an injective base change of integral domains the
  descent is an equivalence.

## Roadmap

This is a prerequisite for Layer 9 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`, "**The
Chevalley--Demazure construction.** For each root datum, an explicitly constructed split reductive
group scheme over `ℤ` realizing it, via a Chevalley basis and the Kostant `ℤ`-form of the enveloping
algebra", which is consumed by milestone L0 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`. The
declaration that will consume it is `EpsilonEridani.IsChevalleySystem`, whose ambient Lie algebra carries
`[LieAlgebra.IsKilling K L]`, applied to `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.lieAlgebra`. That Lie algebra is
defined over `ℚ`, and
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/SimplyConnectedRootDatum/LieAlgebra.lean` records that it "is not
asserted to be semisimple: Mathlib derives that from Geck's construction over an algebraically
closed field, and `ℚ` is not one", Mathlib's
`RootPairing.GeckConstruction.instHasTrivialRadical` carrying an `[IsAlgClosed K]` hypothesis. This
file supplies the general half of closing that gap; the remaining half is the identification of
`AlgebraicClosure ℚ ⊗[ℚ] EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.lieAlgebra` with Geck's Lie algebra over
`AlgebraicClosure ℚ`.
