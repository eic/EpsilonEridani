# Root vectors normalised against the coroots

Let `L` be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with non-degenerate Killing form over a field `K` of
characteristic zero, and let `H` be a splitting Cartan subalgebra. Each root `α` has a
one-dimensional root space `Lα`, so a root vector is determined by a scalar, and Mathlib's
`LieAlgebra.IsKilling.exists_isSl2Triple_of_weight_isNonZero` produces one root vector at a time:
for a single root `α` there are `e ∈ Lα` and `f ∈ L₍₋α₎` with `⁅e, f⁆ = α^∨`.

Chevalley's construction needs those choices made **simultaneously and compatibly**, for all roots
at once: a family `x : Weight K H L → L` with `x α ∈ Lα` and

`⁅x α, x (-α)⁆ = α^∨`   for every root `α`.

This file defines that condition as `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System` — the name records what it says, that
`(α^∨, x α, x (-α))` is an `sl₂` triple for every root — and proves that such a family exists.

Choosing the root vectors one root at a time does not give a system: the vector chosen for `-α` and
the partner of the vector chosen for `α` are two elements of the same line, and they need not agree.
The construction below therefore chooses one root out of each pair `{α, -α}` and reads off the
vector at the other root from the triple already chosen, which is possible because `α ↦ -α` is a
fixed-point-free involution on the roots. That selection is
`EpsilonEridani.exists_rootPairRepresentatives`, stated separately because every later rescaling of a
normalised family has to make the same choice. The resulting family satisfies the normalisation
on the nose, in both directions, because an `sl₂` triple stays one when `e` and `f` are exchanged
and `h` is negated, and `(-α)^∨ = -α^∨`.

Beyond the definition and the existence theorem, the file records what a system gives: the `sl₂`
triple at each root, the resulting nonvanishing and the identification of each root space as the
line it spans, the Cartan relation `⁅β^∨, x α⁆ = α(β^∨) • x α`, the grading `⁅x α, x β⁆ ∈ L₍α+β₎`
with its vanishing when `α + β` is not a root, that the root vectors together with `H` span `L`,
the Killing pairing of opposite normalized root vectors, and that two systems differ by scalars
`c α` subject to `c α * c (-α) = 1`.

## What this is not

An `IsSl2System` is not yet a Chevalley basis, and this file does not claim it is. A Chevalley basis
asks in addition that the structure constants `c α β` in `⁅x α, x β⁆ = c α β • x (α + β)` be the
integers `±(p + 1)`, `p` the root-string parameter, and Bourbaki's *Chevalley system* asks moreover
that the family be exchanged with its negatives by the Chevalley involution. Neither condition is
imposed here: the normalisation `⁅x α, x (-α)⁆ = α^∨` alone is what pins the Cartan part of the
would-be integral form, and it is a prerequisite of both, since the structure constants are only
defined once the root vectors are.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System`: a family of root vectors, one for each weight, normalised so that
  `⁅x α, x (-α)⁆ = α^∨` at every root and carrying no data at a zero weight.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Weight.ne_neg_of_isNonZero`: negation fixes no root.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_rootPairRepresentatives`: a set of weights containing exactly one of
  `α` and `-α` for every root `α`.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_isSl2System`: such a family exists.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.isSl2Triple`: `(α^∨, x α, x (-α))` is an `sl₂` triple.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.toSubmodule_rootSpace_eq_span`: `x α` spans the root space of `α`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.killingForm_root_neg_eq`: the Killing pairing of opposite normalized root
  vectors is `2 / α((cartanEquivDual H)⁻¹ α)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.lie_coroot`: the Cartan relation.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.isNilpotent_ad_rootVector`: every member of the family acts nilpotently in
  the adjoint representation.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.lie_mem_rootSpace_add` and
  `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.lie_eq_zero_of_rootSpace_add_eq_bot`: the root grading of the bracket.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.exists_lie_eq_smul_of_coe_eq_add`: the structure constants exist.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.span_range_sup_toSubmodule_eq_top`: the root vectors and `H` span `L`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.eq_of_forall_isNonZero`: a system is determined by its root vectors.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.mul_eq_one_of_eq_smul`: two systems differ by scalars `c` with
  `c α * c (-α) = 1`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.smul`: rescaling by scalars inverse on opposite roots preserves a normalised
  system.

/-- A family of root vectors normalised against the coroots: `x α` lies in the root space of `α`,
and `⁅x α, x (-α)⁆` is the coroot `α^∨` for every root `α`. Equivalently, `(α^∨, x α, x (-α))` is
an `sl₂` triple for every root `α`, whence the name.

Only the roots carry data: the value at a zero weight is pinned to `0`, so that a system is
determined by its root vectors, as `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.eq_of_forall_isNonZero` records. -/
