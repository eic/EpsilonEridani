# Simultaneous eigenvectors of a subalgebra

Let `H` be a subalgebra of a Lie algebra `L` acting on a module `M`. A vector `v` on which every
element of `H` acts by a scalar is a **simultaneous eigenvector**, its eigenvalue being the
function `chi : H → R` that records those scalars. This file collects two facts about such a vector.
When `H` is nilpotent, it lies in the generalized weight space of its eigenvalue. And applying to
it an eigenvector `f` of the adjoint action shifts its eigenvalue by that of `f`, once per
application; this second fact is one element of `L` at a time, so it needs no subalgebra at all.

Both are stated over a commutative ring; the weight-space result assumes the subalgebra is
nilpotent. The Cartan subalgebra of a Lie algebra with non-degenerate Killing form, where the
eigenvalue of `f` is a root, is the case the weight theory uses, and
`EpsilonEridani.lie_pow_toEnd_eq_smul_of_mem_rootSpace` records it.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.mem_genWeightSpace_of_forall_lie_eq_smul`: a simultaneous eigenvector of `H` lies in the
  generalized weight space of its eigenvalue, at nilpotency index one.
* `EpsilonEridani.lie_pow_toEnd_eq_smul`: for a single `x : L`, applying an `x`-eigenvector `f` of
  eigenvalue `c` to an `x`-eigenvector of eigenvalue `a`, `k` times, gives an `x`-eigenvector of
  eigenvalue `a + k c`.
* `EpsilonEridani.lie_pow_toEnd_eq_smul_of_mem_rootSpace`: the specialization of the shift to a vector of
  the root space of `psi`, which is an adjoint eigenvector of weight `psi` by
  `LieAlgebra.IsKilling.lie_eq_smul_of_mem_rootSpace`.

## References

This is elementary weight-space infrastructure for the highest weight modules of Layer 3 and the
"integrability relation" milestone of Layer 4 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md`: the weight shift is what makes
a lowered highest weight vector an eigenvector again.

Each application of `f` costs one `c` by the Leibniz rule, and the statement is the induction on
