# Symmetries of root-vector structure constants

Let `x` be an `IsSl2System`, so that its root vectors satisfy
`⁅x α, x (-α)⁆ = α∨`. The structure constants of `x` were defined in
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.Lie.Weights.StructureConstant.Basic` by

```text
⁅x α, x β⁆ = N(α, β) x(α + β).
```

This file proves two symmetries of these constants. First, a Lie endomorphism exchanging each of the
three root vectors with the negative of its opposite sends `N(α, β)` to `-N(-α, -β)`. These
hypotheses hold when the normalized family is a Chevalley system, chosen compatibly with the
Chevalley involution. Second, invariance of the Killing form gives the cyclic relation

```text
N(α, β) B(x(α + β), x(-α - β))
  = N(β, -α - β) B(x α, x(-α)).
```

The Killing factors are nonzero and explicitly evaluated by the preceding `IsSl2System` API, so
this is a genuine relation between the two constants rather than a vacuous equality. Together
these are the symmetry relations used when a normalized root-vector system is rescaled coherently
to a Chevalley basis. They advance the explicit Chevalley--Demazure construction in Layer 9 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`; the existence of the coherent rescaling is not asserted
here.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.mul_structureConstant_eq_of_map_eq_smul_neg`: the general scalar relation
  induced by a Lie endomorphism carrying three root vectors to their opposites.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.structureConstant_neg_neg_of_hom`: compatibility with a Lie endomorphism
  exchanging root vectors with the negatives of their opposites.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.structureConstant_mul_killingForm_eq`: the cyclic Killing-form symmetry.

/-- **Cyclic symmetry of normalized structure constants.** If `γ = α + β`, invariance of the
Killing form relates the constants of `(α, β, γ)` and `(β, -γ, -α)` after weighting by the
Killing pairings of opposite root vectors.

Both Killing factors are nonzero by `EpsilonEridani.killingForm_ne_zero_of_mem_rootSpace`, and their exact
values are given by `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.killingForm_root_neg_eq`, so the equality can safely be
cancelled or rewritten as a ratio downstream. -/
