# Opposite structure constants multiply to `-(p + 1)²`

Let `x` be an `IsSl2System` in a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with non-degenerate Killing form
over a field of characteristic zero, so that `⁅x α, x (-α)⁆ = α∨`, and let `γ = α + β` be a root.
Writing

```text
⁅x α, x β⁆ = N(α, β) x γ,
```

this file proves the identity

```text
N(α, β) * N(-α, -β) = -(p + 1)²,      p = chainBotCoeff α β.
```

Nothing beyond the normalisation `⁅x α, x (-α)⁆ = α∨` is assumed: no Chevalley involution, and no
integrality of the constants. The proof combines the root-string product formula, the cyclic
Killing-form symmetry applied to the triple `(γ, -α, β)`, and the invariant root-length ratio.

The identity is exactly the rescaling invariant of a normalised system. Replacing `x` by
`c α • x α` with `c α * c (-α) = 1` multiplies `N(α, β)` by `c α * c β / c γ` and `N(-α, -β)` by
its inverse, so the product is the same for every normalised system, and the two constants
determine each other. The consequence recorded here is that the Chevalley-involution symmetry
`N(-α, -β) = -N(α, β)` holds precisely when `N(α, β)` is one of the Chevalley integers `±(p + 1)`.
That equivalence turns the compatibility with a Chevalley involution, which is data, into a
property of the structure constants alone.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.structureConstant_mul_structureConstant_neg_neg`: the product identity.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.structureConstant_neg_neg_eq_neg_iff`: the Chevalley-involution symmetry
  holds exactly when the constant is `±(p + 1)`.

/-- **Opposite structure constants multiply to `-(p + 1)²`.** For a normalised root-vector system
and a root `γ = α + β`,

```text
N(α, β) * N(-α, -β) = -(p + 1)²,
```

where `p = chainBotCoeff α β`. No compatibility with a Chevalley involution is assumed: the
identity holds for every normalised system, and is invariant under the rescalings that relate two
of them.

The proof multiplies the root-string product formula `N(α, β) N(-α, γ) = q (p + 1)` by the cyclic
Killing-form symmetry of the triple `(γ, -α, β)`, which rewrites `N(-α, γ)` in terms of
`N(-α, -β)`, and then cancels `q` against the invariant root-length ratio
`q B(x β, x (-β)) = (p + 1) B(x γ, x (-γ))`. -/

/-- **The Chevalley-involution symmetry is integrality.** For a normalised root-vector system and
a root `γ = α + β`, the structure constants at `(α, β)` and `(-α, -β)` are negatives of each other
exactly when the constant at `(α, β)` is one of the Chevalley integers `±(p + 1)`.

The forward direction is the reason a Chevalley system has integral structure constants; the
reverse direction is what lets a Chevalley involution be built from an integrally normalised
system rather than assumed alongside it. -/
