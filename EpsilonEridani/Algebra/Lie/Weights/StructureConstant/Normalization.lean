# The square of a Chevalley structure constant

Let `x` be an `IsSl2System`, so its opposite root vectors are normalized by

```text
⁅x α, x (-α)⁆ = α∨.
```

Suppose also that a Lie endomorphism sends the root vectors at `α`, `β`, and
`γ = α + β` to the negatives of their opposite root vectors. This is the local part of the
Chevalley-involution compatibility required of a Chevalley system. Writing

```text
⁅x α, x β⁆ = N x γ,
⁅x (-α), x γ⁆ = M x β,
```

the Chevalley-involution and cyclic Killing-form symmetries give

```text
M B(x β, x (-β)) = N B(x γ, x (-γ)).
```

The root-string calculation gives `N M = q (p + 1)`, where
`β - pα, ..., β, ..., β + qα` is the `α`-string through `β`. Combining them determines the
square of `N`:

```text
N² B(x γ, x (-γ)) = q (p + 1) B(x β, x (-β)).
```

This weighted square identity is the local normalization calculation in the Chevalley basis
theorem. The usual root-length identity

```text
q B(x β, x (-β)) = (p + 1) B(x γ, x (-γ))
```

then gives `N = ±(p + 1)`. The last two theorems expose precisely that cancellation step, so the
remaining global construction only has to supply a compatible Chevalley system and the standard
root-length identity; it does not have to repeat the structure-constant algebra.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.structureConstant_neg_add_mul_killingForm_eq`: the two consecutive
  structure constants in the root string are related by the Killing pairings.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.structureConstant_sq_mul_killingForm_eq`: the weighted square identity.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.structureConstant_sq_eq_natCast_sq_of_killingForm_ratio`: the square is
  `(p + 1)²` once the root-length ratio is supplied.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsSl2System.structureConstant_eq_natCast_or_eq_neg_natCast_of_killingForm_ratio`: the
  resulting Chevalley normalization `N = ±(p + 1)`.

/-- The structure constant for `⁅x (-α), x γ⁆` times the Killing pairing at `β` equals the
structure constant for `⁅x α, x β⁆` times the Killing pairing at `γ`, provided the three root
vectors are compatible with a Chevalley involution.

This is the relation that lets the root-string product formula determine a square rather than only
a product of two a priori unrelated constants. -/

/-- If the Killing pairings along a root string satisfy the standard root-length ratio, then the
square of the corresponding Chevalley-compatible structure constant is `(p + 1)²`.

The hypothesis is separated from the structure-constant calculation because it is a statement
about the invariant form of the root system, independent of the choice of root vectors. -/
