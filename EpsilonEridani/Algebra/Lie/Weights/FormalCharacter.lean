# The formal character of a finite-dimensional Lie module

Let `L` be a nilpotent Lie algebra over a field `K` acting on a finite-dimensional module `M` with
linear weights. The **formal character** of `M` is the multiplicity function `χ ↦ dim Mχ`, recorded
as an element of the integral group algebra `ℤ[Module.Dual K L]` of the dual of `L`: it is the
generating function of the weight-space dimensions, and the object in which the Weyl character
formula is an identity.

The multiplicities are Mathlib's *generalized* weight spaces `LieModule.genWeightSpace`. Over an
algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, for the Cartan subalgebra of a Killing-semisimple
Lie algebra, these are honest simultaneous eigenspaces (`EpsilonEridani.genWeightSpace_eq_weightSpace`), so
the coefficients really are the honest weight multiplicities; that identification is recorded
below rather than built into the definition, which needs no semisimplicity.

## The group algebra as the carrier

The carrier is `AddMonoidAlgebra ℤ (Module.Dual K L)`, the group algebra of the *whole* dual rather
than of the weight lattice. Nothing is lost: for a module over a Killing-semisimple Lie algebra
every coefficient of the character sits at an integral weight
(`EpsilonEridani.isIntegralWeight_of_formalCharacter_coeff_ne_zero`), so the character lands in the
lattice part of the larger algebra. The convolution product of that algebra is what makes
multiplicativity on tensor products expressible.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.formalCharacter`: the formal character `χ ↦ dim Mχ` of a finite-dimensional module.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.formalCharacter_coeff`: its coefficients are the weight-space dimensions.
* `EpsilonEridani.formalCharacter_congr`: isomorphic modules have the same formal character.
* `EpsilonEridani.sum_formalCharacter_coeff_eq_finrank`: when `M` is triangularizable, the coefficients
  sum to `dim M`, and
  `EpsilonEridani.formalCharacter_eq_zero_iff` reads off that the character vanishes only for the zero
  module.
* `EpsilonEridani.formalCharacter_prod`: **additivity.** The character of a product of modules is the sum
  of their characters. Its weight-theoretic input is
  `EpsilonEridani.mem_genWeightSpace_prod_iff`, that a vector lies in a generalized weight space of a
  product exactly when both components lie in the corresponding generalized weight spaces, with
  `EpsilonEridani.genWeightSpace_prod_eq_bot_iff` and
  `EpsilonEridani.instLinearWeightsProd` the consequences a product of modules needs to have a character
  at all.
* `EpsilonEridani.formalCharacter_eq_sum_of_isInternal`: **additivity over an internal decomposition.**
  The character of a module decomposed internally by finitely many Lie submodules is the sum of
  their characters, the character being read on a nilpotent Lie subalgebra of the acting algebra.
* `EpsilonEridani.formalCharacter_eq_add_of_exact`: **additivity on short exact sequences.** The
  character of the middle module is the sum of the characters of the submodule and quotient.
* `EpsilonEridani.finrank_genWeightSpace_tensorProduct`: the multiplicity of a tensor-product weight is
  the convolution of the multiplicities in the two factors.
* `EpsilonEridani.formalCharacter_tensor`: **multiplicativity.** The character of a tensor product is the
  product of the characters.
* `EpsilonEridani.formalCharacter_coeff_eq_finrank_weightSpace`: over an algebraically closed field of
  characteristic zero, for a Cartan subalgebra of a Killing-semisimple Lie algebra, the coefficients
  are the *honest* weight multiplicities.
* `EpsilonEridani.isIntegralWeight_of_formalCharacter_coeff_ne_zero`: the character is supported on
  integral weights.
* `EpsilonEridani.formalCharacter_coeff_weylGroup_smul`: **Weyl invariance** of the character.

## Implementation notes

The support of the coefficient function is finite because it is contained in the image of the
finite type `LieModule.Weight K L M` under `LieModule.Weight.toLinear`, so the coefficients are
assembled with `Finsupp.ofSupportFinite`.

Additivity for a short exact sequence is proved directly, without choosing a splitting: a
surjective Lie-module map is surjective on each generalized weight space by
`EpsilonEridani.genWeightSpaceMap_surjective`, and rank-nullity gives the coefficient identity.

## References

This is the "formal characters" item of Layer 6 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md`, whose target signature
`formalCharacter` is pinned in the accompanying `Suggested.lean`. Its stated prerequisite is the
Layer 2 diagonalizability theorem, which supplies the honest multiplicities, together with the
Layer 2 Weyl invariance proved directly from `sl₂`; both are consumed here.

An `L`-module `M` decomposed internally by Lie submodules has, at every linear form on a nilpotent
Lie subalgebra `H` of `L`, a weight space that is the direct sum of the weight spaces of the
summands, so the weight multiplicities add. This is the two-algebra statement the highest weight
theory calls for: the decomposition is by submodules for the whole of `L`, while the character is
read on a Cartan subalgebra `H`.
