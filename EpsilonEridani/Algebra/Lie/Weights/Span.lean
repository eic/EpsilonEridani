# Spans of generalized weight spaces

A nilpotent Lie algebra `H` acting on a module `M` cuts `M` into the generalized weight spaces
`LieModule.genWeightSpace M χ`, indexed by the scalar-valued functions `χ` on `H`. This file
records the `H`-submodule spanned by the weight spaces indexed by a set `S` of such functions,
together with its universal property, and the one fact about the bracket that a span of weight
spaces obeys: a root vector shifts it by the corresponding root.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.genWeightSpaceSpan H M S`: the `H`-submodule of `M` spanned by the weight spaces indexed
  by a set `S` of scalar-valued functions on `H`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.genWeightSpace_le_genWeightSpaceSpan` and `EpsilonEridani.genWeightSpaceSpan_le_iff` are the
  universal property of the span: it is contained in a given submodule exactly when each of the
  weight spaces it is spanned by is. `EpsilonEridani.genWeightSpaceSpan_mono` is the resulting monotonicity
  in the indexing set.
* `EpsilonEridani.genWeightSpaceSpan_eq_iSup` exhibits the span as a supremum, so that a member can be
  taken apart by `LieSubmodule.iSup_induction` without unfolding the definition.
* `EpsilonEridani.lie_mem_genWeightSpaceSpan`: for a nilpotent subalgebra `H` of a Lie algebra `L` acting
  on `M`, a vector in the root space of `α` carries the span of a set `S` of weight spaces into the
  span of any set containing `α + S`.

## Implementation notes

The span is valued in `LieSubmodule R H M` rather than in `Submodule R M`: the weight spaces are
`H`-submodules by construction, so this records for free that `⁅H, -⁆` preserves the span.

The bracket lemma is the only place an ambient Lie algebra `L` appears; everything else is stated
for an abstract nilpotent `H` acting on `M`.

## References

This file is the elementary weight-space infrastructure that the "Borel and the nilradicals" item
of Layer 3 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md` and the highest
weight modules above it are built from: `EpsilonEridani.rootSpaceSpan`, hence the two nilradicals, is its
instance at `M = L`.
