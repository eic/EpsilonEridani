# The integral weight lattice and the coroot pairings of a weight

Let `L` be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with non-degenerate Killing form over a field `K` of
characteristic zero and let `H` be a splitting Cartan subalgebra. A linear form
`lam : Module.Dual K H` is *integral* when `lam (α^∨)` is an integer for every root `α`
(`EpsilonEridani.IsIntegralWeight`). This file records the two structures that condition carries: the
**integer** `⟨lam, αᵢ^∨⟩` itself, and the **integral weight lattice** of all integral weights.

The point of naming the integer is that `K` carries no order. Statements such as "`lam` is
dominant" or "`⟨lam + ρ, α^∨⟩` is positive" are not about `K` at all: they are about the integers
that integrality produces, and over an arbitrary characteristic-zero field they can only be made
by naming those integers. `EpsilonEridani.coweightPairing lam i` is that name. Being `ℤ`-valued it is
total in `lam`: it is the integer that `lam (αᵢ^∨)` names whenever that one value is an integer,
and it is unconstrained only at the roots where that value is not. Integrality is what guarantees
this at every root at once, so the cast equation `EpsilonEridani.intCast_coweightPairing` saying what the
integer *is* -- a statement about all of `lam` -- and the algebraic laws that follow from it carry
the integrality hypothesis. What needs no hypothesis is a single coroot value already displayed as
an integer -- exhibiting that integer *is* integrality at that root -- and that is how the pairing
is computed here (`EpsilonEridani.coweightPairing_eq_of_apply_coroot_eq_intCast`).

The integral weights are closed under the operations of `EpsilonEridani.IsIntegralWeight.add`,
`EpsilonEridani.IsIntegralWeight.neg` and `EpsilonEridani.IsIntegralWeight.zsmul`, so they form a `ℤ`-submodule
`EpsilonEridani.integralWeightLattice` of `Module.Dual K H` -- a lattice and not a `K`-subspace, the
integrality condition being arithmetic rather than linear. The roots lie in it; that the Weyl
vector `ρ` of a base does too is proved with the rest of the dominance theory, in
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/HighestWeight/Weight/Lattice.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.coweightPairing lam i`: the integer `⟨lam, αᵢ^∨⟩` pairing a weight with the coroot of
  the root `i`; the value of `lam` on that coroot whenever that value is an integer -- so at every
  root when `lam` is integral -- and unconstrained where it is not.
* `EpsilonEridani.integralWeightLattice H`: the integral weights, as a `ℤ`-submodule of
  `Module.Dual K H`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.intCast_coweightPairing`: the defining property, `(⟨lam, αᵢ^∨⟩ : K) = lam (αᵢ^∨)` for
  an integral weight `lam`. Together with `EpsilonEridani.coweightPairing_eq_iff` it pins the pairing
  down, `K` having characteristic zero.
* `EpsilonEridani.coweightPairing_add`, `EpsilonEridani.coweightPairing_neg`, `EpsilonEridani.coweightPairing_sub` and
  `EpsilonEridani.coweightPairing_zsmul`: the pairing is additive in an integral weight.
* `EpsilonEridani.coweightPairing_root_eq_pairingIn`: at a root the pairing is the Cartan integer, in
  Mathlib's crystallographic root-pairing spelling.
* `EpsilonEridani.root_mem_integralWeightLattice`: the roots are integral weights.

## Implementation notes

`EpsilonEridani.coweightPairing` is the inverse image of `lam (αᵢ^∨)` under the integer cast, taken with
`Function.invFun`; the cast is injective in characteristic zero, so wherever that value is an
integer -- in particular at every root of an integral weight -- this is the unique integer with the
right image, and no further choice is made.

`EpsilonEridani.rootCartanWeight` of `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/Weights/Root/CorootSpan.lean` is the same
integer for a *root* in the first argument, where the root-chain coefficients compute it outright.
Neither subsumes the other: the Cartan integers of `EpsilonEridani.rootCartanWeight` are available with no
hypothesis, while the pairing here accepts the weight of a module, a sum `lam + ρ`, or any other
integral weight, which is what the dominance and dimension statements pair against a coroot. The
lemma identifying the two, `EpsilonEridani.coweightPairing_toLinear_eq_rootCartanWeight`, is stated beside
`EpsilonEridani.rootCartanWeight`, so that nothing here depends on the root-chain theory.

/-! ### The coroot pairings of a weight -/

/-- **The coroot pairing `⟨lam, αᵢ^∨⟩` of a weight, as an integer.** Whenever `lam (αᵢ^∨)` lies in
the image of `ℤ` this is the unique integer mapping to it
(`EpsilonEridani.coweightPairing_eq_of_apply_coroot_eq_intCast`), which for an integral weight `lam` is the
case at every root (`EpsilonEridani.intCast_coweightPairing`); at a root where `lam (αᵢ^∨)` is not an
integer the value is unconstrained.

Making the pairing `ℤ`-valued is what lets dominance and positivity be stated over a field with no
order: see the module docstring. -/
