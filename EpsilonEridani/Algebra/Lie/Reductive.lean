# Reductive Lie algebras: the centre and the derived ideal span, and a converse criterion

A finite-dimensional Lie algebra `L` over a field of characteristic zero is **reductive** when its
solvable radical is its centre, Mathlib's `LieAlgebra.HasCentralRadical`. This file proves that a
reductive Lie algebra is spanned by its centre and its derived ideal,

`center K L ⊔ ⁅L, L⁆ = ⊤`  (`EpsilonEridani.sup_center_derivedSeries_eq_top`),

and draws the consequences the representation theory of a reductive Lie algebra runs on: the
derived ideal is perfect, equivariance of a linear map may be tested on the centre and on the
derived ideal, and a finite-dimensional irreducible module over `L` stays irreducible over the
derived ideal (`EpsilonEridani.isIrreducible_restrict_derivedSeries`).

It also proves the converse criterion. If the derived ideal `⁅L, L⁆` has **no nonzero solvable
ideals** (`LieAlgebra.HasTrivialRadical`, which a semisimple Lie algebra has) then `L` is
reductive (`EpsilonEridani.hasCentralRadical_of_hasTrivialRadical_derivedSeries`) and every solvable
ideal, the centre among them, meets `⁅L, L⁆` only in `⊥`
(`EpsilonEridani.inf_derivedSeries_eq_bot_of_isSolvable`). That much is elementary and much cheaper than
the spanning half: it holds over any commutative ring and needs no Killing form, no
characteristic-zero hypothesis, no finite dimension and no Noetherian hypothesis.

Over a field of characteristic zero and in finite dimension, where the spanning half is available,
the two combine into a direct sum

`L = Z(L) ⊕ ⁅L, L⁆`

(`EpsilonEridani.isCompl_center_derivedSeries_of_hasTrivialRadical_derivedSeries`), which therefore
carries those hypotheses even though the criterion itself does not.

## The argument for the criterion

For a solvable ideal `J` the bracket `⁅L, J⁆` lies in `J`, because that is an ideal, and in
`⁅L, L⁆`, because every bracket does. The intersection `J ⊓ ⁅L, L⁆` is a solvable ideal of `L`
inside `⁅L, L⁆`, hence — read as an ideal of the Lie algebra `⁅L, L⁆` through `LieIdeal.restrict`
of `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/Solvable.lean` — a solvable ideal of an algebra with trivial radical, so
it vanishes. An element of `J` therefore brackets to zero against everything: it is central. The
radical is the supremum of the solvable ideals, so it is central too — that is reductivity, and no
finiteness hypothesis is needed because the radical itself never has to be solvable. The centre is
one of those solvable ideals, so it meets `⁅L, L⁆` trivially, which is directness of the sum.

## The argument for the spanning half

Everything comes from the Killing form `κ` and its orthogonal complements
(`LieIdeal.killingCompl`). Cartan's criterion, in the form
`LieAlgebra.killingCompl_top_le_radical`, says that the radical of `κ` is contained in the solvable
radical; for a reductive `L` that radical is the centre, and the reverse inclusion is immediate
because a central element has vanishing adjoint action. So the radical of `κ` is the centre
(`EpsilonEridani.killingCompl_top_eq_center`).

The derived ideal has the *same* orthogonal complement
(`EpsilonEridani.killingCompl_derivedSeries_eq_center`). Indeed the invariance `κ ⁅x, y⁆ z = κ x ⁅y, z⁆`
turns "`x` is orthogonal to every bracket" into "`⁅y, x⁆` is orthogonal to everything", that is
into `⁅y, x⁆ ∈ center K L` for every `y`. The elements with that property are the normalizer of the
centre, an ideal whose derived ideal is central and therefore abelian: it is a solvable ideal, so
reductivity puts it back inside the centre. This is `EpsilonEridani.normalizer_center_eq_center`.

Two subspaces of a finite-dimensional space with the same orthogonal complement for a symmetric
form need not be equal — but they are if both contain the radical of the form, and the dimension
formula `LinearMap.BilinForm.finrank_add_finrank_orthogonal` makes that precise. Applied to
`center K L ⊔ ⁅L, L⁆`, whose orthogonal complement is the centre by the two computations above and
which contains the centre for trivial reasons, it forces that ideal to be everything.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.normalizer_center_eq_center`: over a reductive Lie algebra the centre is its own
  normalizer, because the normalizer is a solvable ideal
  (`EpsilonEridani.isSolvable_normalizer_center`).
* `EpsilonEridani.killingCompl_top_eq_center` and `EpsilonEridani.killingCompl_derivedSeries_eq_center`: the
  radical of the Killing form and the orthogonal complement of the derived ideal are both the
  centre.
* `EpsilonEridani.sup_center_derivedSeries_eq_top`: **the centre and the derived ideal span**,
  `center K L ⊔ ⁅L, L⁆ = ⊤`, with `EpsilonEridani.exists_mem_center_add_mem_derivedSeries` its
  elementwise form.
* `EpsilonEridani.lie_derivedSeries_derivedSeries_eq_self`: **the derived ideal is perfect.**
* `EpsilonEridani.map_lie_of_forall_center_of_forall_derivedSeries` and
  `EpsilonEridani.lieModuleEquivOfCenterOfDerivedSeries`: a linear map equivariant for the centre and for
  the derived ideal is equivariant for `L`, so a derived-ideal equivalence between modules on which
  the centre acts by the same scalars is an `L`-equivalence.
* `EpsilonEridani.isIrreducible_restrict_derivedSeries`: **a finite-dimensional irreducible module over a
  reductive Lie algebra restricts to an irreducible module over the derived ideal**, over an
  algebraically closed field.
* `EpsilonEridani.inf_derivedSeries_eq_bot_of_isSolvable` and `EpsilonEridani.le_center_of_isSolvable`: when
  the derived ideal has trivial radical, **every solvable ideal is central**, meeting the derived
  ideal only in `⊥`.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasCentralRadical_of_hasTrivialRadical_derivedSeries`: **a Lie algebra whose derived
  ideal has trivial radical is reductive**, with
  `EpsilonEridani.radical_le_center_of_hasTrivialRadical_derivedSeries` the inclusion it rests on.
* `EpsilonEridani.isCompl_center_derivedSeries_of_hasTrivialRadical_derivedSeries`: **such a Lie algebra
  is the direct sum of its centre and its derived ideal**, over a field of characteristic zero and
  in finite dimension.

/-- **The semisimple part acts irreducibly.** A finite-dimensional irreducible module over a
reductive Lie algebra, over an algebraically closed field, restricts to an irreducible module over
the derived ideal.

The centre acts by scalars (`EpsilonEridani.exists_centralWeight_of_isIrreducible`), so every subspace of
`M` is stable under it; since the centre and the derived ideal span, a submodule for the derived
ideal is already a submodule for `L`. Algebraic closedness is essential and not a convenience: over
`ℝ` the one-dimensional abelian Lie algebra acting on `ℝ²` by the rotation generator is
irreducible, is its own centre, and has zero derived ideal.

Together with the central weight, this shows that every finite-dimensional irreducible determines
an irreducible restricted module and a functional on the centre; reconstruction and uniqueness are
not asserted here. -/
