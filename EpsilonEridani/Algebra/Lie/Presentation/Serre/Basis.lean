# The Serre system carried by a Lie algebra basis

A `LieAlgebra.Basis ι H` carries four of the six families of Serre relations as fields: the `hᵢ`
commute, `⁅eᵢ, fᵢ⁆ = hᵢ`, `⁅eᵢ, fⱼ⁆ = 0` for `i ≠ j`, and the two eigenvector equations for
`ad hᵢ`. This file proves the remaining two, the higher relations

```text
(ad eᵢ) ^ (1 - Aⱼᵢ) eⱼ = 0    and    (ad fᵢ) ^ (1 - Aⱼᵢ) fⱼ = 0,
```

so that the generators of a basis form a `EpsilonEridani.IsSerreSystem` and the Lie algebra is a quotient
of the Serre algebra of the transposed matrix of the basis.

The coefficient ring is a characteristic-zero integral domain, and the Lie algebra is torsion-free
and Noetherian as a module over it, which is what makes the `sl₂`-strings finite. In particular no
Killing form, splitting Cartan subalgebra or triangularizability is assumed, and the argument never
mentions a root system.

The proof is `sl₂` theory rather than root strings. For `i ≠ j` the vector `eⱼ` is primitive for
the triple `(-hᵢ, fᵢ, eᵢ)` obtained from `LieAlgebra.Basis.sl2` by exchanging the raising and
lowering generators, because `⁅fᵢ, eⱼ⁆ = 0`, and its eigenvalue for `-hᵢ` is `-Aⱼᵢ`. A primitive
vector in a Noetherian module has a natural number as eigenvalue, so `-Aⱼᵢ` is one, and one further
step along its string is zero. The `f` family follows by applying the result for `e` to the
symmetric basis, which exchanges `e` and `f` and negates `h`.

Reading `-Aⱼᵢ` off `LieAlgebra.IsSl2Triple.HasPrimitiveVectorWith.exists_nat` rather than assuming
it is why no sign condition on the off-diagonal entries of `LieAlgebra.Basis.A` is needed: that
`-Aⱼᵢ` is a nonnegative integer is a consequence of the relations.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ad_pow_lie_lieBasis_e_e` and `EpsilonEridani.ad_pow_lie_lieBasis_f_f`: the two higher Serre
  relations for the generators of a Lie algebra basis.
* `EpsilonEridani.isSerreSystem_lieBasis`: those generators form a Serre system for the transposed matrix
  of the basis.
* `EpsilonEridani.serreLift_lieBasis_surjective`: the homomorphism induced by those generators is
  surjective.

## Roadmap

Layer 9 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md` asks for the split reductive group scheme
over `ℤ` to be constructed "via a Chevalley basis and the Kostant `ℤ`-form of the enveloping
algebra". `RootPairing.GeckConstruction.basis` produces a `LieAlgebra.Basis` for the explicit
matrix Lie algebra of a root system over any field of characteristic zero, whereas that algebra is
known to have a nondegenerate Killing form only over an algebraically closed one. So a form of
these relations that does not assume `LieAlgebra.IsKilling` is what a pinned construction over `ℚ`
can use, and `EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/SimplyConnectedRootDatum/SerrePresentation.lean` is
the consumer. `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/Presentation/Serre/Killing.lean` keeps the root-string form of
the same relations, which applies to a split semisimple Lie algebra presented by a base rather
than by a basis.
