# PBW filtrations for Lie quotients

The quotient map of a Lie algebra by a Lie ideal induces a surjective map between corresponding
PBW filtration steps. This file records the quotient specializations of the general surjectivity
results in `PBW.Functoriality`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.map_mkQ_pbwFiltration`: specialization to a quotient by a
  Lie ideal.
* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.map_mkQ_pbwFiltrationPrevious`: the same for the step
  immediately preceding a filtration degree.
* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.mapFiltration_mkQ_surjective`: the induced linear map between
  quotient filtration steps is surjective.
