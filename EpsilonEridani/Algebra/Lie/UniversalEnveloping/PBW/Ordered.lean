# Ordered monomials span the PBW filtration

Let `e : ι → L` be a linearly ordered spanning family of a Lie algebra. This file proves that the
degree-`k` Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt filtration of `UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra R L` is spanned by the
monomials

```text
ι(e(i₁)) ⋯ ι(e(iₙ)),    i₁ ≤ ⋯ ≤ iₙ,    n ≤ k.
```

There are two steps. First, `span_prod_map_eq_wordFiltration` expands arbitrary Lie-algebra words in
the spanning family. Second, sorting a word in that family changes it only by a term in the
preceding filtration step, by
`pbwMonomial_sub_insertionSort_mem_pbwFiltrationPrevious`. Induction on the filtration degree then
absorbs this error into shorter ordered monomials.

For an arbitrary Lie homomorphism, the induced enveloping-algebra map sends the ordered monomials
in a family, and their span, exactly onto those for the image family.

This is the spanning half of the ordered-monomial basis target in Layer 3 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md`. Linear independence, and hence the
full PBW basis, still requires the symmetric-algebra comparison.

## Main definitions and results

* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.orderedPBWMonomials`: the ordered monomials of length at
  most a specified degree.
* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.map_span_orderedPBWMonomials`: induced maps carry their
  spans onto the spans of the corresponding image-family monomials.
* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.span_orderedPBWMonomials_eq_pbwFiltration`: these monomials
  span exactly the corresponding PBW filtration step.
* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.span_iUnion_orderedPBWMonomials_eq_top`: all ordered monomials
  span the universal enveloping algebra.
