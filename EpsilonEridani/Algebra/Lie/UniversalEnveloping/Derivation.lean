# Lifting a Lie derivation to the enveloping algebra

A derivation `D` of a Lie algebra `L` extends uniquely to a derivation `Dᵁ` of the associative
algebra `U(L)`, characterised by `Dᵁ (ι x) = ι (D x)` on the canonical Lie generators.  This file
constructs that extension and identifies the assignment `D ↦ Dᵁ` as a homomorphism of Lie algebras
into the derivation algebra of `U(L)`.

## The construction

Nothing but the universal property of `U(L)` is used.  Write `A[ε] = A ⊕ Aε` for the dual numbers
over an algebra `A` (Mathlib's `DualNumber`, the square-zero extension of `A` by itself), and send

`x ↦ ι x + ε · ι (D x) : L → U(L)[ε]`.

The Leibniz rule `D ⁅x, y⁆ = ⁅x, D y⁆ + ⁅D x, y⁆` says exactly that this map is a homomorphism of
Lie algebras, because the `ε`-component of a commutator in `A[ε]` is the sum of the two
commutators obtained by differentiating one factor at a time.  So it lifts to an algebra
homomorphism `F : U(L) → U(L)[ε]`; its `1`-component is an algebra endomorphism of `U(L)` fixing
the generators, hence the identity, and multiplicativity of `F` then reads, on `ε`-components, as
the associative Leibniz rule for `a ↦ (F a).snd`.  That map is `Dᵁ`.

The extension is unique because the canonical generators generate `U(L)` as an *algebra*
(`EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.adjoin_range_ι`) and the elements on which two derivations
agree are closed under products and contain the scalars; this is
`EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.derivation_ext`, and it is what makes `D ↦ Dᵁ` additive,
`R`-linear and bracket-preserving without any further computation.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.envelopingDerivation`: the derivation `Dᵁ` of `U(L)`
  extending a Lie derivation `D` of `L`, as an element of the derivation Lie algebra
  `EpsilonEridani.derivationLieAlgebra R (U L)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.envelopingDerivationHom`: the assignment `D ↦ Dᵁ`, as a
  homomorphism of Lie algebras `LieDerivation R L L →ₗ⁅R⁆ Der (U L)`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.derivation_ext`: **two derivations of `U(L)` agreeing on the
  canonical Lie generators are equal.**
* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.envelopingDerivation_ι`: **the extension property**
  `Dᵁ (ι x) = ι (D x)`, with
  `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.envelopingDerivation_ι'` its `simp`-normal form.
* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.envelopingDerivation_mul`: **the associative Leibniz rule**
  `Dᵁ (a * b) = Dᵁ a * b + a * Dᵁ b`.
* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.map_envelopingDerivation`: **naturality**, that a Lie
  homomorphism `f : L → L'` intertwining `D` with `E` intertwines `Dᵁ` with `Eᵁ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.envelopingDerivation_inner`: the extension of the inner
  derivation `y ↦ ⁅y, x⁆` of `L` is `-innerDerivation R (ι x)`, the derivation `a ↦ ⁅a, ι x⁆` of
  `U(L)`; so the construction carries the adjoint action of `L` on itself to the adjoint action of
  `U(L)` on itself, up to the sign by which the two conventions differ.
* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.derivation_range_le_iff`: a derivation has range in a
  two-sided ideal exactly when its values on the canonical generators lie there, with
  `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.envelopingDerivation_range_le_iff` as the specialization to
  lifted derivations.
* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.envelopingDerivation_mem_stableDerivations_pow`: under the
  same generator condition, every power of the ideal is stable under the lifted derivation.

## Implementation notes

`envelopingDerivation` is valued in the bundled derivation algebra
`EpsilonEridani.derivationLieAlgebra R (U L)` of `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/Derivation/Basic.lean` rather than
in the bare `U L →ₗ[R] U L`: that is the noncommutative derivation API this construction is meant
to be read in (Mathlib's `Derivation` needs a commutative algebra, and `LieDerivation` needs a Lie
bracket, so neither applies to `U(L)`).  The bundling is also what lets `D ↦ Dᵁ` be a `LieHom`,
since the target is a Lie algebra on the nose.

The canonical `simp` rule for `Dᵁ (a * b)` is the generic `EpsilonEridani.derivationLieAlgebra.leibniz`,
which holds of every bundled derivation;
`EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.envelopingDerivation_mul` is its specialisation to `Dᵁ`, stated
under a name a reader of this file will look for because the Leibniz rule is the defining property
of the extension, and carrying no `simp` tag of its own.

No lemma with `UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.ι` on the left-hand side is a `simp` lemma here, for the
reason recorded in `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/UniversalEnveloping/Basic.lean`: `simp` rewrites `ι` through
Mathlib's `UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.ι_apply`, so such a left-hand side is not in simp-normal
form.  The primed variants are the simp-normal ones.
