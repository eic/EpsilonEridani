# The Kostant form is an integral form of the enveloping algebra

Let `L` be a Lie algebra over `ℚ` and let `e : ι → L` and `h : κ → L` be the two distinguished
families out of which `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.kostantForm` is built. As soon as those
families generate `L` as a Lie algebra, the resulting subring is an integral form of the whole
enveloping algebra: extending its scalars to `ℚ` recovers `U(L)`,

```text
ℚ ⊗[ℤ] kostantForm e h ≃ₐ[ℚ] UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra ℚ L.
```

The spanning half of that statement is
`EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.span_kostantForm_eq_top`, proved with the form itself. What
this file adds is that the comparison map is an isomorphism and not merely a surjection: it is
`Subring.ratBaseChangeEquiv` applied to the form, the point being that the map out of `ℚ ⊗[ℤ] R` is
injective for every subring `R` of a `ℚ`-algebra, so a rationally spanning subring is automatically
a `ℤ`-form.

Nothing here bounds the form from the other side. That the form is a *free* `ℤ`-module on the
ordered monomials in divided powers, the integral Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt theorem, is a separate
statement and is not proved here; the results below say only that the form rationally spans the
enveloping algebra and allows denominators to be cleared.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.kostantFormBaseChange`: the isomorphism
  `ℚ ⊗[ℤ] kostantForm e h ≃ₐ[ℚ] UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra ℚ L`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.exists_natCast_smul_mem_kostantForm`: every element of the
  enveloping algebra is carried into the form by a nonzero natural number.
