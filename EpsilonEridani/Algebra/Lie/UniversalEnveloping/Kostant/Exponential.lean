# Root subgroup elements of a Kostant integral form

Let `L` be a Lie algebra over `ℚ` with distinguished root vectors `e : ι → L` and Cartan vectors
`h : κ → L`, and let `U_ℤ = kostantForm e h` be the integral form they generate inside
`UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra ℚ L`. A root vector `eᵢ` need not be nilpotent in the enveloping
algebra itself — a nonzero Chevalley root vector never is, the enveloping algebra being a domain —
but whenever its image under an algebra map `f` is nilpotent — an extra hypothesis throughout,
satisfied by the finite-dimensional representations the construction is applied to —

```text
x_i(t) = exp (t • f (ι ℚ (eᵢ))) = ∑ n, tⁿ • f (eᵢ⁽ⁿ⁾)
```

makes sense and has integer coefficients on the images of the root-vector generators of the
Kostant form. What is built here is this integral-point family of units, indexed by `t : ℤ`; a
later development is to exhibit it as the `ℤ`-points of a **root subgroup map**
`x_α : 𝔾ₐ → G` of the Chevalley--Demazure construction. No scheme, and no morphism of schemes,
appears below.

The results below record what integrality buys. First, `x_i(t)` lies in the image of the Kostant
form. Second, and this is the form the construction of a Chevalley group actually uses, `x_i(t)`
preserves any additive subgroup of a representation that the Kostant form preserves — an
*admissible lattice*. Both statements are for an arbitrary integer `t`, which is exactly the range
of scalars for which the rational coefficients `tⁿ/n!` of the ordinary exponential series
recombine into integers.

The divided-power expansion, the one-parameter group law `x_i(t) x_i(u) = x_i(t + u)` and the
general stability statements are `EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/Nilpotent/Exp.lean`; nothing here re-proves
them. Nothing here assumes the Chevalley relations either: the results hold for any families of
distinguished vectors, and a pinned root datum will supply the specific ones.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.exp_zsmul_mem_map_kostantForm`: a root subgroup element lies
  in the image of the Kostant form.
* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.dividedPower_apply_mem_of_kostantForm_apply_mem`: divided
  powers of root vectors preserve any Kostant-stable additive subgroup.
* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.exp_zsmul_apply_mem_of_kostantForm_apply_mem`: a root
  subgroup element preserves every additive subgroup of a representation that the Kostant form
  preserves.

/-- A **root subgroup element** `exp (t • f (eᵢ))` lies in the image of the Kostant integral form.

The exponential is an a priori rational combination of powers of `f (eᵢ)`; the content is that it
is an integral combination of the images of the root-vector generators `eᵢ⁽ⁿ⁾`. -/

/-- **A root subgroup element preserves an admissible lattice.** If an additive subgroup `M` of a
representation `V` of `L` is stable under the Kostant integral form, then it is stable under every
root subgroup element `exp (t • ρ (eᵢ))` with `t` an integer.

Only stability under the divided powers of the single root vector `eᵢ` is used; that weaker
statement is `EpsilonEridani.exp_zsmul_smul_mem`.

Stability of `M` under the whole group generated by these elements follows, since the inverse of
`exp (t • ρ (eᵢ))` is `exp (-t • ρ (eᵢ))`, of the same shape. This is how a Chevalley group is cut
out as a group of automorphisms of a lattice. -/
