# Identities for the trace form of a Lie module

Let `M` be a representation of a Lie algebra `L` over a commutative ring `R`. Its trace form
`B = LieModule.traceForm R L M` is symmetric and invariant, `B ⁅a, b⁆ c = B a ⁅b, c⁆`. Together
with the Leibniz rule those two properties give an identity in four elements,

```text
B ⁅a, b⁆ ⁅c, d⁆ + B ⁅b, c⁆ ⁅a, d⁆ + B ⁅c, a⁆ ⁅b, d⁆ = 0,
```

which is the Jacobi identity rewritten so that each summand pairs two brackets against each other
rather than iterating them. No hypothesis at all is needed on the four elements: this is a
consequence of invariance and symmetry, and it holds in every Lie algebra.

Its purpose is downstream: when `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are root vectors of a split semisimple Lie
algebra and `B` is the Killing form, each summand evaluates to a product of two structure
constants weighted by the Killing pairing of an opposite pair of root vectors, and the identity
becomes the four-term relation between the structure constants. Grouping the brackets in pairs is
exactly what makes that evaluation possible, since a summand with an iterated bracket would mix
root spaces of three different roots.

A second, unrelated identity is collected here: over a reduced ring the trace form kills a pair
that brackets to zero as soon as one of the two acts nilpotently, because the composite of the two
actions is then nilpotent and a nilpotent scalar in a reduced ring is zero. Specialized to the
adjoint representation this says that an ad-nilpotent element is Killing-orthogonal to its own
centraliser.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.traceForm_lie_lie_cyclic_eq_zero`: the four-element cyclic identity above.
* `EpsilonEridani.traceForm_eq_zero_of_isNilpotent_of_lie_eq_zero`: elements bracketing to zero, one of
  them acting nilpotently, are orthogonal for the trace form.

/-- **An element acting nilpotently is orthogonal, for the trace form of any representation, to
everything it brackets to zero with.**  The trace form pairs `x` and `y` by the trace of the
composite of their actions; bracketing to zero in `L` makes those actions commute, since
`toEnd R L M` is a morphism of Lie rings, and the trace of a composite with a commuting nilpotent
factor vanishes over a reduced ring. -/
