# The multiplicity of an irreducible Lie module

`LieModule.isotypicMultiplicity R L M S` is the finrank of the space `S →ₗ⁅R,L⁆ M` of morphisms
from a Lie module `S` to a Lie module `M`. This file proves that when `S` is finite-dimensional and
irreducible over an algebraically closed field, this number counts
the summands equivalent to `S` in any *finite* decomposition of `M` into irreducible Lie
submodules, and is therefore independent of which such decomposition is chosen: it is the
**multiplicity** of `S` in `M`.

## The argument

The morphism space is **additive over a direct sum in its target**: a morphism `S →ₗ⁅R,L⁆ ⨁ i, Pᵢ`
is the same thing as a family of morphisms `S →ₗ⁅R,L⁆ Pᵢ`, one for each `i`, which is
`EpsilonEridani.LieModule.lieModuleHomDirectSumEquiv` of `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/DirectSum.lean`.
Transporting along `DirectSum.lieModuleEquivOfIsInternal` of
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/Submodule/DirectSum.lean` turns that into additivity over an *internal*
decomposition of `M` by Lie submodules.

The per-summand contribution is Schur's lemma in the dimension form of
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/Schur.lean`: for irreducible `S` and `Nᵢ` over an algebraically closed field,
`dim_K (S →ₗ⁅K,L⁆ Nᵢ)` is `1` when `Nᵢ ≃ S` and `0` otherwise. Summing over the finite index type
gives the count. Since the left-hand side never mentions the decomposition, two finite
decompositions of the same module have the same number of summands equivalent to `S`; this is the
uniqueness statement that makes "the multiplicity of `S` in `M`" well defined.

Nothing here needs complete reducibility: the counting theorem is stated for a finite decomposition
it is handed. Complete reducibility is what *produces* such a decomposition, through
`EpsilonEridani.exists_isInternal_isIrreducible` of `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/Submodule/Decomposition.lean`,
which a consumer combines with the counting theorem below.

## Implementation notes

The multiplicity joins the Lie isotypy interface of `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/Isotypic.lean`
(`LieModule.isotypicComponent`, `LieModule.IsIsotypicOfType`), and like that interface it is stated
without the universal enveloping algebra: this layer depends only on Lie submodules and Lie-module
morphisms. The comparison with the ring-level multiplicity theory of
`EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/Semisimple/Multiplicity.lean` is therefore made where the rest of the
enveloping-algebra dictionary lives,
`LieModule.isotypicMultiplicity_eq_natCard_of_linearEquiv_pi` of
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/UniversalEnveloping/Multiplicity.lean`, exactly as
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/UniversalEnveloping/Isotypic.lean` does for the isotypic component.

## Main definitions

* `LieModule.isotypicMultiplicity`: the finrank of `S →ₗ⁅R,L⁆ M`, which the theorems below
  identify with the multiplicity under their field, irreducibility, and decomposition hypotheses.

## Main results

* `LieModule.isotypicMultiplicity_eq_sum_of_isInternal`: **the multiplicity is additive over a
  finite decomposition of `M` into Lie submodules.**
* `LieModule.isotypicMultiplicity_eq_zero_of_subsingleton`: the zero module occurs with
  multiplicity zero.
* `LieModule.isotypicMultiplicity_eq_zero_of_subsingleton_codomain`: everything occurs in the zero
  module with multiplicity zero.
* `LieModule.isotypicMultiplicity_self`: an irreducible module occurs in itself with multiplicity
  one.
* `LieModule.isotypicMultiplicity_eq_of_lieModuleEquiv` and
  `LieModule.isotypicMultiplicity_eq_of_lieModuleEquiv_type`: the multiplicity depends only on the
  equivalence classes of `M` and of `S`.
* `LieModule.isotypicMultiplicity_eq_ncard_of_isInternal`: **the multiplicity counts the summands
  equivalent to `S`** in a finite decomposition of `M` into irreducibles.
* `LieModule.ncard_setOf_nonempty_lieModuleEquiv_eq`: **the count is independent of which finite
  decomposition is taken.**

## Roadmap

This is the `isotypicMultiplicity` target of the decomposition toolkit in Layer 6 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md`, together with the additivity of
the morphism space over a direct-sum decomposition that `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/Schur.lean` names as
the missing ingredient of the multiplicity theorem. The multiplicity is stated for an arbitrary
irreducible `S` rather than for the irreducible quotient `L(λ)`, which the roadmap's own signature
uses; the `L(λ)`-indexed form is this statement with `S` instantiated. The finrank of the isotypic
component, `dim (LieModule.isotypicComponent S M) = isotypicMultiplicity · dim S`, is the next item
of that milestone, "Isotypic components and multiplicities, through the enveloping-algebra
dictionary"; it is proved through the dictionary, as
`LieModule.finrank_isotypicComponent` of
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/UniversalEnveloping/Multiplicity.lean`. The packaged decomposition
`M ≃ ⨁_λ L(λ)^{⊕ m_λ}` that closes the milestone is
`EpsilonEridani.nonempty_lieModuleEquiv_directSum_irreducibleQuotient` of
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/HighestWeight/Decomposition.lean`, which counts the summands of a
decomposition with the theorems below. The toolkit's remaining milestone, the tensor
multiplicities with the minuscule Pieri rule, is untouched here.

finite-dimensional `S` over an algebraically closed field this is the multiplicity of `S` in `M`:
the number of summands equivalent to `S` in any finite decomposition of `M` into
irreducibles (`LieModule.isotypicMultiplicity_eq_ncard_of_isInternal`), and stating it as the
finrank of a morphism space is what makes it manifestly independent of the decomposition. In the
generality of the definition it is not itself a multiplicity: for a finite-dimensional irreducible
`S` over a field and a finite irreducible direct-sum decomposition of `M`, it is the multiplicity
times `dim End_L(S)`, a factor that Schur's lemma makes `1` over an algebraically closed field. -/
