# The q-Euler form at `q = 1` against the ungraded Ext-Euler characteristic

Let `C` be a `k`-linear abelian category with a grading-shift autoequivalence `e`, and let `D` be
a `k`-linear abelian category thought of as `C` with its grading forgotten along a functor `U`.
Setting `q = 1` collapses the internal degrees of

```text
χ_q(X, Y) = ∑ n, (-1)ⁿ ∑ j, q⁻ʲ dim_k Ext^n(X, Y{j})
```

into the single alternating sum `∑ n, (-1)ⁿ ∑ j, dim_k Ext^n(X, Y{j})`.  That is the ordinary
Ext-Euler characteristic of the ungraded pair only when the ungraded `Ext` groups assemble the
graded ones, so the identification is not a formal consequence of having a shift: it needs the
comparison isomorphisms

```text
⨁ j, Ext^n(X, Y{j}) ≅ Ext^n(X', Y')
```

as an extra hypothesis, recorded here as `EpsilonEridani.IsGradedExtComparison`.  A pair `(X', Y')` of
objects of `D` is the intended value `(U X, U Y)` of such a functor, but nothing below uses `U`
itself, so the predicate is stated for two objects of `D` directly.  Only the isomorphisms
themselves are asked for: comparing the two Ext long exact sequences would need them to be
compatible with the connecting maps as well, which the numerical identity below does not use.

Under that hypothesis the ungraded pair inherits both halves of Euler-admissibility from the
graded one, and `EpsilonEridani.IsGradedExtComparison.laurentEval_one_gradedExtEuler` identifies the
specialization of the q-Euler characteristic at `q = 1` with the ordinary Ext-Euler
characteristic.  The same identity for the packaged sesquilinear form is
`EpsilonEridani.IsGradedExtComparison.gradedExtEulerSpecialized_one_mk_of_mk_of`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsGradedExtComparison`: the bigraded `Ext` groups of a pair in `C` assemble, degree by
  cohomological degree, into the ungraded `Ext` groups of a pair in `D`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isGradedExtComparison_of_subsingleton_ne`: a grading concentrated in a single internal
  degree admits the shifted pair `(X, Y{d})` as a comparison inside the same category.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsGradedExtComparison.isEulerAdmissible`: a graded Euler-admissible pair has an
  Euler-admissible comparison pair.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsGradedExtComparison.laurentEval_one_gradedExtEuler`: `χ_q(X, Y)` evaluated at
  `q = 1` is `χ(X', Y')`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsGradedExtComparison.gradedExtEulerSpecialized_one_mk_of_mk_of`: the same identity
  for the q-Euler form specialized at `q = 1`.

/-- The bigraded `Ext` groups of `(X, Y)` **assemble into the ungraded `Ext` groups** of a pair
`(X', Y')`: in every cohomological degree the direct sum over the internal degrees of
`Ext^n(X, Y{j})` is `Ext^n(X', Y')`.

This is the hypothesis under which a q-Euler form specializes at `q = 1` to an ordinary Ext-Euler
characteristic.  A functor forgetting the grading supplies the intended pairs `(U X, U Y)`; the
existence of such a functor, or even of a shift-compatible one, does not by itself supply these
isomorphisms. -/

/-- **A grading concentrated in a single internal degree admits a shifted comparison pair.**  If
the bigraded `Ext` groups of `(X, Y)` vanish in every internal degree other than `d`, then the
surviving degree is the whole direct sum, so `(X, Y{d})` is a comparison pair for `(X, Y)` inside
the same category. -/
