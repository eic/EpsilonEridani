# The dual numbers: `Ext`-finite but not `Ext`-bounded

Let `k` be a field, let `A = k[ε]` be the dual numbers `k[ε]/(ε²)`, and let `S = A/(ε)` be the
residue field of `A`, viewed as an `A`-module. Every `Ext` group of the pair `(S, S)` is a
one-dimensional `k`-vector space (`EpsilonEridani.extDualNumberResidueEquiv`), so `EpsilonEridani.IsExtFinite`
holds while none of the groups vanishes and `EpsilonEridani.IsExtBounded` fails: the alternating sum
`∑ n, (-1)ⁿ dim_k Extⁿ(S, S)` is not a finite sum. This is the example that separates the two
halves of `EpsilonEridani.IsEulerAdmissible`. Since `EpsilonEridani.extEuler` takes a proof of
`EpsilonEridani.IsEulerAdmissible` as an argument, it cannot be instantiated for this pair and exposes no
totalised fallback value.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.not_isExtBounded_dualNumberResidue`: no degree bounds the `Ext`-support of `(S, S)`.
  This half needs only a nontrivial commutative ring of coefficients.
* `EpsilonEridani.isExtFinite_dualNumberResidue`: every `Extⁿ(S, S)` is a finite-dimensional
  `k`-vector space.
* `EpsilonEridani.not_isEulerAdmissible_dualNumberResidue`: the pair `(S, S)` is not Euler-admissible.
