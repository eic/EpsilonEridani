# Short exact kernel and cokernel sequences

This file records that the canonical kernel sequence of an epimorphism and the canonical cokernel
sequence of a monomorphism are short exact.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.kernelSequence_shortExact`: the kernel sequence of an epimorphism is short exact.
* `EpsilonEridani.cokernelSequence_shortExact`: the cokernel sequence of a monomorphism is short exact.
