# Differential graded algebras as `A∞` algebras

A nonunital differential graded algebra `(A, d)` is an `A∞` algebra with `m₁ = d`, `m₂` the
product, and `m n = 0` for `n ≥ 3`.  The arity-one and arity-two Stasheff identities are `d² = 0`
and the graded Leibniz rule, the arity-three identity is associativity, and every identity of arity
at least four vanishes term by term, because each of its terms contains an operation of arity at
least three.  No unit is needed for any of this, and a morphism of nonunital DG algebras is a
strict `A∞` morphism.  For a unital DG algebra the unit is moreover a strict unit, and a morphism
of DG algebras is a strictly unital strict `A∞` morphism.

The nonunital generality matters because cohomology algebras need not be unital: the cohomology
of an `A∞` algebra is only a graded nonunital algebra, and it becomes an `A∞` algebra, with zero
unary operation, through `EpsilonEridani.isNonUnitalDGAlgebra_zero`.

Conversely, an `A∞` algebra structure on a graded nonunital algebra whose binary operation is the
product makes its unary operation a DG algebra differential.  If its higher operations vanish, it
is the `A∞` algebra of that DG algebra.  Thus nonunital DG algebras are exactly the `A∞` algebras
on graded nonunital algebras whose binary operation is the product and whose higher operations
vanish.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsNonUnitalDGAlgebra.toAInfinityAlgebra`: the `A∞` algebra of a nonunital DG algebra.
* `EpsilonEridani.NonUnitalDGAlgHom.toAInfinityStrictHom`: a nonunital DG algebra morphism as a strict
  `A∞` morphism.
* `EpsilonEridani.DGAlgHom.toAInfinityStrictUnitalHom`: a DG algebra morphism as a strictly unital
  strict `A∞` morphism.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsNonUnitalDGAlgebra.toAInfinityAlgebra_m_one_apply`,
  `toAInfinityAlgebra_m_two_apply`, and `toAInfinityAlgebra_m_of_three_le`: its operations are the
  differential, the product, and zero.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra.strictUnit_one`: the unit of a DG algebra is a strict unit.
* `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityAlgebra.isNonUnitalDGAlgebra_differential` and
  `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityAlgebra.isDGAlgebra_differential`: the unary operation of an `A∞` algebra
  whose binary operation is the product is a DG algebra differential.
* `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityAlgebra.eq_toAInfinityAlgebra`: such an `A∞` algebra with vanishing higher
  operations is the `A∞` algebra of that DG algebra.
