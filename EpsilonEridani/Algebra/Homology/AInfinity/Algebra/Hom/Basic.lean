# Morphisms of A-infinity algebras

A morphism of uncurved nonunital `A∞` algebras `A ⟶ B` is a degree-zero coalgebra morphism
`F : Tᶜ(sA) ⟶ Tᶜ(sB)` of reduced bar constructions which intertwines the bar differentials,
`b_B ∘ F = F ∘ b_A`.  A coalgebra morphism of reduced tensor coalgebras is determined by its
suspended Taylor components `Tᶜ(sA) ⟶ sB`, and every family of such components arises from
exactly one coalgebra morphism
(`EpsilonEridani.ReducedTensorWords.coalgHomEquivTaylor`).  This coalgebra morphism is therefore the
stored datum, and the Taylor components are derived from it.

The bar-differential equation is equivalent to its projection onto single letters, the suspended
component equation `taylor_B ∘ F = f ∘ b_A` for the Taylor components `f` of `F`
(`EpsilonEridani.ReducedTensorWords.IsCoalgHom.comp_eq_comp_iff_letter_comp_eq`).  Hence every
degree-zero family of Taylor components satisfying the component equation is the family of
exactly one `A∞` morphism, `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityHom.ofTaylor`.

With this definition identities and composites are those of linear maps, so the category laws
hold on the nose.  The arity-one Taylor component is the linear part `f₁ : A ⟶ B`: it has degree
zero and is a chain map for the unary operations.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityHom`: a morphism of nonunital `A∞` algebras.
* `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityHom.taylor`: its suspended Taylor components.
* `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityHom.linearPart`: its arity-one component `f₁`.
* `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityHom.ofTaylor`: the `A∞` morphism with prescribed Taylor components satisfying
  the component equation.
* `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityHom.id` and `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityHom.comp`: identities and composition.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityHom.ext`: an `A∞` morphism is determined by its Taylor components.
* `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityHom.taylor_comp_barMap`: the Taylor components satisfy the suspended component
  equation, and `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityHom.taylor_ofTaylor`: every solution of it arises.
* `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityHom.comp_assoc`, `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityHom.comp_id`, and
  `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityHom.id_comp`: the category laws.
* `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityHom.linearPart_m_one`: the linear part is a chain map.
* `EpsilonEridani.AInfinityHom.linearPart_mem`: the linear part preserves degrees.
