# Homology commutes with scalar multiplication of chain maps

For a linear category `C`, the map induced on homology by a chain map is linear in the chain
map: `homologyMap (a • φ) i = a • homologyMap φ i`. This is the homological-complex version of
Mathlib's `ShortComplex.homologyMap_smul`, recorded as a TODO in
`Mathlib/Algebra/Homology/Linear.lean`. It identifies, for instance, the map induced by
multiplication by a scalar on a complex of modules with multiplication by that scalar on
homology, and it makes the homology functor in each degree a linear functor.
