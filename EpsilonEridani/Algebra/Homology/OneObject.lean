# One-object homological complexes

A square-zero endomorphism of an object in a category with zero morphisms determines a
homological complex indexed by `Unit`, using the circular shape `ComplexShape.refl Unit`. This
file provides that construction and records its unique object and differential.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.oneObjectHomologicalComplex`: the homological complex associated to a square-zero
  endomorphism.
