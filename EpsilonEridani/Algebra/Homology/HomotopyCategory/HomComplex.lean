# The differential of a cochain complex as a cochain

Mathlib's `CochainComplex.HomComplex.Cochain.diff K` is the differential of a cochain complex `K`
read as a degree `1` cochain from `K` to itself, and `CochainComplex.HomComplex.δ` is the
differential of the Hom complex.  This file records the elementary calculus relating the two:
`δ` is composition with the differential cochains on either side, a morphism of cochain complexes
commutes with them, and they square to zero.

These are general facts about Mathlib's Hom complex, independent of any particular use.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.δ_eq_comp_diff_add_diff_comp`: the differential of the Hom complex is
  `δ z = z d + (-1)^(n+1) d z`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ofHom_comp_diff`: a morphism of cochain complexes commutes with the differential
  cochains.
* `EpsilonEridani.diff_comp_diff`: the differential cochain squares to zero.
