# Augmented differential graded algebras

An augmentation of a differential graded algebra `A` over `R` is a morphism of DG algebras from
`A` to the ground ring, placed in degree zero with zero differential.  Its kernel is the reduced
augmentation ideal.  It is homogeneous, stable under the differential and multiplication from
either side, and the unit section splits the underlying module as
`A ≃ R × ker ε`.

This is the input used by the reduced bar construction: tensor words are formed from the
augmentation ideal rather than from the unit-containing algebra.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.DGAlgAugmentation`: a DG algebra morphism from `A` to the trivially graded base ring.
* `EpsilonEridani.DGAlgAugmentation.augmentationIdeal`: the homogeneous kernel of an augmentation.
* `EpsilonEridani.DGAlgAugmentation.twoSidedIdeal`: the same kernel as a two-sided ideal of `A`.
* `EpsilonEridani.DGAlgAugmentation.splitLinearEquiv`: the canonical linear splitting
  `A ≃ R × ker ε`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra.unitHom`: the canonical unit morphism from the trivially graded base.
