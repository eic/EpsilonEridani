# The cohomology algebra of a differential graded algebra

Let `d` be a differential on an internally `ℤ`-graded `R`-algebra `𝒜` on a carrier `A`, in the
sense of `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra`.  Its **cycles** are the kernel of `d` and its **boundaries** are the
image of `d`.  This file shows that the cycles form a subalgebra of `A`, that the boundaries form a
two-sided ideal of that subalgebra, and that the resulting quotient `R`-algebra -- the **cohomology
algebra** `H(A)` -- inherits a `ℤ`-grading whose degree-`p` piece is the module of classes of
homogeneous cycles of degree `p`.

Two features of the graded Leibniz rule drive everything.  First, its sign depends only on the
degree of the left factor, so a product with a cycle on the right is differentiated without any
sign; this makes the cycles closed under multiplication and makes a boundary times a cycle a
boundary.  Second, the differential is homogeneous, so it commutes with the projections of the
grading up to a shift of one.  Consequently the degree-`p` component of a boundary `d a` is
`d (a_{p-1})`, again a boundary, which is exactly the statement that the boundaries are a
homogeneous ideal -- the input to the independence half of the decomposition of `H(A)`.

Because `A` is not assumed commutative, the boundaries are recorded as a `TwoSidedIdeal` of the
cycles; its underlying ideal is two-sided, so the cohomology algebra uses Mathlib's
`Ideal.Quotient`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra.cycles`: the kernel of the differential, as a subalgebra.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra.cyclesDeg`: the homogeneous cycles of a fixed degree.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra.boundaries`: the image of the differential, as a two-sided ideal of the
  cycles.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra.Cohomology`: the cohomology algebra, implemented by Mathlib's quotient of
  the cycles by the underlying ideal of boundaries.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra.cohomologyGrading`: the grading of the cohomology algebra by the classes of
  homogeneous cycles.
* `EpsilonEridani.algEquivCohomologyOfZero`: a graded algebra with zero differential is its own
  cohomology.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra.iSup_cyclesDeg_eq_top`: every cycle is a sum of homogeneous ones.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra.instGradedAlgebraCohomologyGrading`: **the cohomology of a differential
  graded algebra is a graded algebra.**
* `EpsilonEridani.map_algEquivCohomologyOfZero_eq_cohomologyGrading`: the identification of a graded
  algebra carrying the zero differential with its own cohomology matches the two gradings
  degreewise.

This advances `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/DGAInfinity/README.md`, Layer 1, item "DG algebras, categories,
modules, and bimodules", specifically its first request for "cycles, boundaries, and the induced
graded cohomology algebra".  The induced grading reuses
`EpsilonEridani.GradedAlgebra.gradedAlgebraQuotientPiece` from
`EpsilonEridani.RingTheory.GradedAlgebra.Homogeneous.Quotient`, whose construction follows Mathlib PR
[#36501](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/36501) by Antoine Chambert-Loir.
