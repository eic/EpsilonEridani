# Nonunital and unital differential graded algebras

A nonunital differential graded algebra over a commutative ring `R` is an internally
`ℤ`-graded nonunital `R`-algebra `A` together with an `R`-linear differential `d` of degree
`+1` which squares to zero and satisfies the graded Leibniz rule

`d (a * b) = d a * b + (-1) ^ |a| * (a * d b)`.

This file fixes the nonunital structure as `EpsilonEridani.IsNonUnitalDGAlgebra`.  Every unital
`EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra` has a canonical underlying nonunital DG algebra, while consequences that
genuinely use the unit remain in the unital namespace.  In particular, the differential of a
unital DG algebra annihilates the unit and hence the image of the ground ring.

The grading is stored *internally*, as a family `𝒜 : ℤ → Submodule R A` of submodules of a
single carrier.  In the nonunital case it consists of a direct-sum decomposition together with
degree-additive multiplication; the unital case uses Mathlib's `GradedAlgebra 𝒜`.  The product is
therefore the product of `A`, so no signed totalization is needed to state the Leibniz rule, and
`Int.negOnePow` carries the only sign.

Only a homogeneous *left* factor is constrained by the Leibniz axiom, because the sign depends on
its degree alone.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsNonUnitalDGAlgebra`: the nonunital differential graded algebra axioms.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra`: the differential graded algebra axioms on an internally `ℤ`-graded
  unital `R`-algebra and an `R`-linear endomorphism of its carrier.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsNonUnitalDGAlgebra.map_decompose` computes the differential on homogeneous
  components.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsNonUnitalDGAlgebra.leibniz_of_map_eq_zero` and
  `EpsilonEridani.IsNonUnitalDGAlgebra.map_mul_eq_zero_of_map_eq_zero` specialize the Leibniz rule
  when the right factor is a cycle.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra.map_one_eq_zero` and `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra.map_algebraMap`: the differential
  annihilates the unit and, more generally, the image of the ground ring.
* `EpsilonEridani.isNonUnitalDGAlgebra_zero` and `EpsilonEridani.isDGAlgebra_zero`: a graded algebra with zero
  differential is a differential graded algebra.

For a unital DG algebra, the homogeneous consequences of the axioms are also available through
its regular differential graded left module.  Cycles, boundaries, and the cohomology algebra are
built from that module structure in `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.Homology.DG.Algebra.Cohomology`.
