# Functoriality of the cohomology algebra

A morphism of differential graded algebras induces a graded algebra homomorphism on cohomology,
compatibly with identities and composition.

The induced map is obtained in two stages.  Commutation with the differentials first restricts the
underlying algebra homomorphism to cycles and sends boundaries to boundaries.  The quotient
universal property then descends this map to cohomology.  Its preservation of the cohomological
grading follows from the description of a homogeneous cohomology class by a homogeneous cycle
representative.

Functoriality is what makes cohomology a usable invariant: it is the source of the notion of a
quasi-isomorphism, a morphism inducing an isomorphism on cohomology, and it is the shadow on
cohomology of the comparison between differential graded algebras and `A∞` algebras.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.DGAlgHom.cyclesMap`: the induced graded algebra homomorphism on cycles.
* `EpsilonEridani.DGAlgHom.cohomologyMap`: the induced graded algebra homomorphism on cohomology.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DGAlgHom.cohomologyMap_mk`: the cohomology map sends the class of a cycle to the class
  of its image.
* `EpsilonEridani.DGAlgHom.cohomologyMap_id` and `EpsilonEridani.DGAlgHom.cohomologyMap_comp`: passage to
  cohomology preserves identities and composition.
