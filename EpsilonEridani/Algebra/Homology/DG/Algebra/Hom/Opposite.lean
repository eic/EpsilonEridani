# Opposite morphisms of differential graded algebras

A DG algebra morphism induces a morphism of Koszul-signed opposite DG algebras, acting by the
original map on underlying elements. Preservation of degrees makes the two multiplication signs
agree, and the unchanged opposite differential commutes with the induced map.

`DGAlgHom.gradedOpposite` preserves identities and composition and is injective on morphisms.
This supplies the functorial algebra construction needed when transporting modules and their
restriction of scalars through graded opposites.

The convention follows B. Keller, *Deriving DG categories*, Section 1, and B. Keller,
*Introduction to A-infinity algebras and modules*, Section 3.1.
