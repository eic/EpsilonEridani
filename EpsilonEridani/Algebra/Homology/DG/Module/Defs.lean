# Differential graded left modules

Let `d` be a differential on an internally `ℤ`-graded `R`-algebra `𝒜` on a carrier `A`, in the
sense of `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra`.  A **differential graded left module** over it is an `A`-module `M`
with an internal `ℤ`-grading `ℳ` for which the action adds degrees, together with an `R`-linear
differential `dM` of degree `+1`, in the sense of `EpsilonEridani.LinearMap.IsHomogeneous`, which squares
to zero and satisfies the graded Leibniz rule

`dM (a • x) = d a • x + (-1) ^ |a| • (a • dM x)`.

Only a homogeneous scalar `a` is constrained by the Leibniz axiom, because the sign depends on its
degree alone; this is the exact shape of `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra.leibniz`, and indeed a differential
graded algebra is a differential graded left module over itself.  Decomposing a scalar into
homogeneous components removes the hypothesis whenever the sign is multiplied by something that
vanishes: the differential of `a • x` is `d a • x` as soon as `x` is a cycle, so a cycle acts on
cycles and the cycles of `A` carry the boundaries of `M` into themselves.

The grading is stored internally, as a family `ℳ : ℤ → Submodule R M` with Mathlib's
`DirectSum.Decomposition ℳ` and `SetLike.GradedSMul 𝒜 ℳ`.  This matches the presentation of
`EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra`, so the action is the given `A`-action on `M` and no signed totalization
intervenes.  The ground ring acts through the algebra, `IsScalarTower R A M`: the `R`-module
structure which carries the grading and the linearity of `dM` is the restriction of the `A`-action
along `algebraMap R A`, so there is only one action of `R` in play.

## Handedness

The handedness is part of the name: this file defines the left interface and says nothing about
the right one, whose Leibniz rule `dM (x • a) = dM x • a + (-1) ^ |x| • (x • d a)` is a separate
axiom system, on an `Aᵐᵒᵖ`-module.  Turning one into the other needs the sign-twisted graded
opposite `a *ᵒᵖ b = (-1) ^ (|a| * |b|) • (b * a)`.  The unsigned `MulOpposite` will not do:
with `a *ᵒᵖ b = b * a` the Leibniz rule for `*ᵒᵖ` asks for
`d (b * a) = b * d a + (-1) ^ |a| • (d b * a)`, while the rule in `A` gives
`d (b * a) = d b * a + (-1) ^ |b| • (b * d a)`.  So no reduction between the two handednesses is
claimed here.  The left handedness is the one Mathlib's `Module A M` gives directly, and the one
whose Leibniz sign depends on the same factor as `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra.leibniz`, which is what lets
a differential graded algebra be a module over itself with no twist.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGLeftModule`: the differential graded left module axioms on an internally `ℤ`-graded
  module over a differential graded algebra and an `R`-linear endomorphism of its carrier.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGLeftModule.map_decompose`: the differential commutes with the homogeneous
  projections of the grading, `dM (x_p) = (dM x)_{p + 1}`; in particular the homogeneous components
  of a cycle are cycles and those of a boundary are boundaries.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGLeftModule.leibniz_of_map_eq_zero`: the Leibniz rule for an arbitrary scalar against
  a cycle, with no sign and no homogeneity hypothesis.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGLeftModule.smul_mem_range_of_map_eq_zero`: a cycle of `A` carries a boundary of `M`
  to a boundary, and `EpsilonEridani.IsDGLeftModule.map_smul_mem_range_of_map_eq_zero`: a boundary of `A`
  carries a cycle of `M` to a boundary.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra.isDGLeftModule`: **a differential graded algebra is a differential graded
  left module over itself.**
* `EpsilonEridani.isDGLeftModule_zero`: a graded module with zero differential over a graded algebra with
  zero differential is a differential graded left module.

Read through `EpsilonEridani.IsDGAlgebra.isDGLeftModule`, these results are the homogeneous consequences
of the algebra axioms used by `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.Homology.DG.Algebra.Cohomology`; the cycles,
boundaries and cohomology module of a module are built on this file in
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.Homology.DG.Module.Cohomology`.
