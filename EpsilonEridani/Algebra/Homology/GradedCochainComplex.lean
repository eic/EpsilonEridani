# The cochain complex of a family of submodules with a differential

A `ℤ`-indexed family `ℳ` of submodules of an `R`-module `M`, together with an `R`-linear
endomorphism `dM` which carries `ℳ p` into `ℳ (p + 1)` and squares to zero on each `ℳ p`,
assembles into a cochain complex of `R`-modules: the degree-`p` term is the submodule `ℳ p` and
the differential is the restriction of `dM`.  This file performs that assembly.  No decomposition
or exhaustiveness hypothesis on `ℳ` is required, and the differential is not assumed to come
from a module action.

In practice `ℳ` is the internal grading in which the differential graded algebras and modules of
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.Homology.DG` store their structure, because a product or an action is easier to
write on one carrier than on a family of summands.  Statements which compare such an object with
a genuine complex — quasi-isomorphisms, Hom complexes, cohomology computed by Mathlib's
homological algebra — need the complex on the other side, and that is what this construction
supplies: it serves the underlying complex of a DG algebra and of a DG module on either side.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.gradedCochainComplex`: the cochain complex whose degree-`p` term is the submodule
  `ℳ p` and whose differential is the restriction of `dM`.

## Implementation notes

The component, differential, and element-level differential lemmas below are the intended public
interface to `gradedCochainComplex`.
