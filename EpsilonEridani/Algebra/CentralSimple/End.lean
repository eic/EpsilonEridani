# The endomorphism algebra of a finite-dimensional vector space is central simple

For a nonzero finite-dimensional vector space `V` over a field `K`, the algebra `Module.End K V` is
central simple over `K`: it is the untwisted, "split" central simple algebra of degree
`Module.finrank K V`. Centrality is already Mathlib's: its `Algebra.IsCentral` instance in
`Mathlib.Algebra.Central.End` covers the endomorphisms of any free module. This file supplies the
missing half, simplicity, as the instance typeclass inference needs, so that `Module.End K V` is
available wherever a central simple algebra is asked for, and computes the degree. The simplicity
theorem itself is the more general `EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.moduleEnd`, for finite modules over simple
Artinian rings; this file promotes its field specialization to an instance.

Simplicity is not reproved here. The general theorem presents an endomorphism ring as a matrix
algebra over the division ring supplied by Schur's lemma. The content of the declaration in this
file is that its field specialization is available to instance search.

Finite-dimensionality is essential for simplicity: on an infinite-dimensional `V` the endomorphisms
of finite rank form a proper nonzero two-sided ideal of `Module.End K V`. The centre, by contrast,
is the scalars in any dimension, which is why Mathlib's centrality instance carries no finiteness
hypothesis.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.moduleEnd_of_field`: `Module.End K V` is a simple ring, for `V` a nonzero
  finite-dimensional `K`-vector space, as an instance specialization of
  `EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.moduleEnd`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.deg_moduleEnd`: the degree of `Module.End K V` is `Module.finrank K V`, for any
  finite-dimensional `V` -- nonzero or not, since the degree is defined for every algebra whose
  dimension is a square. Equivalently
  `Module.finrank K (Module.End K V) = (Module.finrank K V) ^ 2`, which is Mathlib's
  `Module.finrank_linearMap`; the point of stating it degree-side is that
  `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.deg` is the invariant that composes, so a split algebra of degree `d` can be
  compared with a general central simple algebra of degree `d`.

/-- **The endomorphism algebra of a nonzero finite-dimensional vector space is a simple ring.**

Finite-dimensionality cannot be dropped: on an infinite-dimensional `V` the finite-rank
endomorphisms are a proper nonzero two-sided ideal. This is the field specialization of
`EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.moduleEnd`. -/

end Nontrivial

/-- The degree of the endomorphism algebra `Module.End K V` is the dimension of `V`. This is the
degree-side reading of `Module.finrank_linearMap`, and it needs no hypothesis beyond
finite-dimensionality: `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.deg` is `Nat.sqrt` of the dimension, and the dimension of
`Module.End K V` is a square whether or not `V` is nonzero. It is the degree of a *split central
simple* algebra exactly when `V` is nonzero, which is the extra hypothesis
`EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.moduleEnd_of_field` carries; for `V = 0` the ring `Module.End K V` is trivial,
hence not simple, and both sides read `0`. -/
