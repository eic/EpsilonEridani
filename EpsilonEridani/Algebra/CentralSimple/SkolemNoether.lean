# The Skolem-Noether theorem

Let `K` be a field, let `A` be a finite-dimensional **simple** `K`-algebra and let `B` be a
finite-dimensional **central simple** `K`-algebra. The Skolem-Noether theorem says that two
`K`-algebra homomorphisms `f g : B →ₐ[K] A` differ by conjugation: there is a unit `u` of `A` with
`g x = u * f x * u⁻¹` for every `x`. Taking `B = A` and `f` the identity, every `K`-algebra
automorphism of a finite-dimensional central simple algebra is inner.

The proof is the classical module-theoretic one. A homomorphism `f : B →ₐ[K] A` makes `A` into a
module over `R = B ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ`, with `B` acting on the left through `f` and `A` on the right by
multiplication; this is `EpsilonEridani.Bimodule f`. Because `B` is central simple and `Aᵐᵒᵖ` is
simple, `R` is a simple ring (`EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.tensorProduct`), and it is finite-dimensional
over `K`, hence Artinian. The two modules `Bimodule f` and `Bimodule g` are carried by one and the
same `K`-vector space `A`, so they have equal dimension, so they are isomorphic `R`-modules
(`EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.nonempty_linearEquiv_of_finrank_eq`). An `R`-linear isomorphism is in
particular linear for the right action of `A`, hence is multiplication on the left by the unit
`u = φ 1`, and its linearity for the left action of `B` is exactly `u * f x = g x * u`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.skolemNoether`: **the Skolem-Noether theorem**.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_unit_conj_of_algEquiv`: every `K`-algebra automorphism of a finite-dimensional
  central simple `K`-algebra is inner.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_unit_conj_subalgebra_val`: a `K`-algebra homomorphism out of a central simple
  subalgebra `B ⊆ A` is conjugate to the inclusion of `B`. This is the form the centralizer theorem
  consumes.

## Implementation notes

Centrality is asked of the **source** `B`, not of the target `A`: what the proof needs is that
`B ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ` is simple, and `EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.tensorProduct` gets that from `B` central simple
and `A` simple. So the statement here is slightly stronger than the usual one, which asks `A` to be
central simple as well; the roadmap's central simple form is the case `Algebra.IsCentral K A`, which
the statement covers because a central simple algebra is in particular simple. Finite-dimensionality
of `B` is *not* assumed: the proof does need it, because the classification of modules that supplies
`φ` needs `B ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ` to be finite-dimensional over `K` and with it Artinian, but it comes for
free from the other hypotheses, since a homomorphism out of the simple ring `B` into the nontrivial
ring `A` is injective and `A` is finite-dimensional.

Centrality of the source really is needed, and not just by this proof: the worked example at the end
of the file exhibits `ℂ` as a simple finite-dimensional `ℝ`-algebra, not central over `ℝ`, whose
complex conjugation is not conjugation by a unit. The classical theorem does hold for a merely
simple `B` provided the ambient `A` is central simple, but that form needs the centralizer theorem
and is a separate, later target; the central simple form pinned here is what the centralizer theorem
itself consumes.

`EpsilonEridani.Bimodule f` is a type synonym for `A` rather than a `Module` instance on `A` itself,
because the whole point is to compare the two different `B ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ`-module structures coming from
`f` and from `g`; indexing the synonym by the homomorphism keeps both available at once. It lives in
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/CentralSimple/Bimodule.lean`, which documents the construction; the centralizer
theorem is its second consumer. The statements exported from this file are the three theorems below,
all phrased in `A` and `B` alone.

`A` are conjugate: there is a unit `u` of `A` with `g x = u * f x * u⁻¹` for all `x : B`.

Finite-dimensionality of `B` is not among the hypotheses: it follows from them, because `f` is
injective, `B` being simple and `A` nontrivial. The proof does use it, to make `B ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ`
Artinian, and with it the classification of modules that produces the conjugating isomorphism. -/

`EpsilonEridani.exists_unit_conj_of_algEquiv` are found by instance search: `Mₙ(K)` is central over `K`,
simple, and finite-dimensional. -/

/-- The negative control for `EpsilonEridani.skolemNoether`: centrality of the **source** cannot be
dropped. Take `K = ℝ` and `A = B = ℂ`, a simple finite-dimensional `ℝ`-algebra which is not central
over `ℝ`. The identity and complex conjugation are then two `ℝ`-algebra endomorphisms of `ℂ` that
are *not* conjugate, because `ℂ` is commutative, so conjugation by a unit is the identity while
conjugation is not. -/
