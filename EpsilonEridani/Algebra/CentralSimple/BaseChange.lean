# Base change preserves central simplicity

Let `A` be a central simple algebra over a field `K` and let `L / K` be a field extension. This file
assembles the statement that the scalar extension `L ⊗[K] A` is central simple *over `L`*, and adds
the degree bookkeeping that goes with it.

Both halves are already available. Simplicity is a statement about `L ⊗[K] A` as a ring, so
`EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.tensorProduct_of_isCentral_right` applies with `L` the simple factor and `A`
the central simple one; centrality over `L` is `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.IsCentral.baseChange`, in
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Central/BaseChange.lean`. Both are instances, so instance search sees `L ⊗[K] A` as
a central simple `L`-algebra with no glue at all.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.deg_baseChange`: base change **preserves the degree**,
  `deg L (L ⊗[K] A) = deg K A`.

Together with the centrality of `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Central/BaseChange.lean` and the two compatibility
equivalences of `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/TensorProduct/BaseChange.lean`, both re-exported here, this is what
will let base change descend to a homomorphism of Brauer groups: the centrality and the simplicity
say the class of `L ⊗[K] A` is defined, and the two equivalences say the assignment respects the
multiplication and the inversion of classes.

## Implementation notes

`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.deg_baseChange` is read off `Module.finrank_baseChange` through the transport
lemma `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.deg_eq_of_finrank_eq`, so it never unfolds `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.deg`. It asks
nothing of `A` beyond being a `K`-algebra: both degrees are the integer square root of the same
dimension, so the equality does not depend on that dimension being a square, and central simplicity
is what makes it one rather than what makes the two agree.

The worked examples at the end check both directions on the two standard test cases: `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ]`
is central simple over `ℂ` of degree `2`, while `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℂ` is *not* central over `ℂ`, because `ℂ` is
not central over `ℝ`. The second is the failure `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.IsCentral.of_baseChange` detects,
and it is the reason the centrality hypothesis on `A` cannot be dropped from the forward direction.

The induced homomorphism of Brauer groups waits on the group structure of `BrauerGroup K`, a

/-- **Base change preserves the degree**: the scalar extension `L ⊗[K] A` has the same dimension
over `L` that `A` has over `K`, and the degree is the integer square root of the dimension.

No hypothesis on `A` is needed. For a finite-dimensional central simple `A` the common dimension is
a square and both sides are the honest degree (`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.deg_sq`); in general the two sides
are equal because they are `Nat.sqrt` of the same number. -/

-- `_root_.` is needed because `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion` is also a namespace, so a bare
-- `open scoped Quaternion` would open that one and leave the `ℍ[·]` notation out of scope.
open scoped _root_.Quaternion

/-- Complexifying the real quaternions gives a central `ℂ`-algebra: instance search finds it. -/
example : Algebra.IsCentral ℂ (ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ]) := inferInstance

/-- It is simple too, so `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ]` is a central simple `ℂ`-algebra with no glue at all. -/
example : IsSimpleRing (ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ]) := inferInstance

/-- Complexification keeps the degree: `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ]` has degree `2`, like `ℍ[ℝ]` itself. (Being
split over the algebraically closed `ℂ`, it is in fact `M₂(ℂ)`.) -/
example : Algebra.deg ℂ (ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ]) = 2 := by
  rw [Algebra.deg_baseChange]
  exact Algebra.deg_eq_of_finrank_eq_sq (by rw [Quaternion.finrank_eq_four]; norm_num)

/-- The negative control for `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.IsCentral.baseChange`: `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℂ` is not central over
`ℂ`, because `ℂ` is not central over `ℝ`. So centrality of the algebra being extended is doing real
work, and `ℂ` is a simple finite-dimensional `ℝ`-algebra that base change excludes.

The proof runs the converse `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.IsCentral.of_baseChange` backwards: assuming
`ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℂ` central over `ℂ` makes `ℂ` central over `ℝ`, and then `Complex.I`, central because `ℂ` is
commutative, would have to be real. -/
example : ¬ Algebra.IsCentral ℂ (ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℂ) := fun _ => by
  have h : Algebra.IsCentral ℝ ℂ := Algebra.IsCentral.of_baseChange (K := ℝ) (L := ℂ) (A := ℂ)
