# The opposite isomorphism `A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ ≃ₐ[K] Mₙ(K)`

Let `A` be a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over a field `K`, of dimension `n` over `K`.
This file proves that the **Azumaya map**

`AlgHom.mulLeftRight K A : A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ →ₐ[K] Module.End K A`,  `a ⊗ₜ b ↦ (x ↦ a * x * b.unop)`,

is an isomorphism, and combines it with a choice of `K`-basis of `A` to write

`A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ ≃ₐ[K] Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) K`.

This is the fact that makes the class of `Aᵐᵒᵖ` the inverse of the class of `A` in the Brauer group:
the tensor product of `A` with its opposite is a full matrix algebra, hence Brauer-trivial.

The matrix size is `n = Module.finrank K A`, **not** the degree: for a central simple algebra of
degree `d` one has `Module.finrank K A = d ^ 2`, so this is `Matrix (Fin (d ^ 2)) (Fin (d ^ 2)) K`.
The dimension and degree counts this rests on are general facts about `A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ` and live with
the rest of the degree API, as `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.finrank_tensorProduct_mulOpposite` and
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.deg_tensorProduct_mulOpposite`.

## The proof

Both halves of bijectivity are cheap once the right facts are in place, and neither is a
computation with the map.

*Injectivity* is simplicity: `Aᵐᵒᵖ` is simple because `A` is, so `A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ` is simple by
`EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.tensorProduct` (this is where centrality of `A` enters), and a ring
homomorphism out of a simple ring into a nontrivial ring is injective (`RingHom.injective`).
No finite-dimensionality is used here, and the half is stated on its own as
`EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.mulLeftRight_injective`.

*Surjectivity* is a dimension count: `A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ` and `Module.End K A` both have dimension `n ^ 2`
over `K`, so an injective `K`-linear map between them is surjective. This is the only place
finite-dimensionality is needed, and it is essential: for an infinite-dimensional central simple
algebra the Azumaya map is injective but need not be surjective.

Centrality enters only through the first half, and it cannot be dropped there. Take `A = ℂ` over
`K = ℝ`, which is simple and finite-dimensional but not central. Then `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℂᵐᵒᵖ` is not simple:
multiplication `a ⊗ₜ b ↦ a * b` is an `ℝ`-algebra map onto `ℂ` whose kernel contains the nonzero
element `Complex.I ⊗ₜ 1 - 1 ⊗ₜ Complex.I`. Injectivity genuinely fails, and so does the conclusion:
because `ℂ` is commutative the Azumaya map has image the scalar multiplications, a `2`-dimensional
subalgebra of the `4`-dimensional `Module.End ℝ ℂ`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.mulLeftRight_injective`: **the Azumaya map of a central simple algebra is
  injective**, with no finiteness hypothesis, and
  `EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.mulLeftRight_bijective`: **for a finite-dimensional one it is bijective**,
  with its packaging `EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.isAzumaya`: such an algebra is an Azumaya algebra over
  its base field.
* `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.tensorOpAlgEquivEnd`: the resulting isomorphism
  `A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ ≃ₐ[K] Module.End K A`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.tensorOpAlgEquivMatrix`: **the opposite isomorphism**
  `A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ ≃ₐ[K] Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) K` for any `n` with `Module.finrank K A = n`.

The last two are stated for `[IsAzumaya K A]`, which is all their construction uses: bijectivity of
the Azumaya map is the field `IsAzumaya.bij`, and the finiteness the matrix half needs is the
`Module.Finite K A` that `IsAzumaya` extends. Over a field this is not a wider class -- an Azumaya
`K`-algebra is exactly a finite-dimensional central simple one -- but it is the hypothesis the
construction actually reads, and the one already carried by an algebra known to be Azumaya for some
other reason (Mathlib's `IsAzumaya.matrix`, `IsAzumaya.of_AlgEquiv`). For a central simple `A` the
way in is `EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.isAzumaya`, installed with `haveI`.

`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.tensorOpAlgEquivEnd` uses nothing else, so it is stated over the commutative
semiring `K` and semiring `A` that `IsAzumaya` itself is defined over. Only the matrix half needs a
field, to read the isomorphism off a basis.

The real quaternions run all of this concretely in
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/CentralSimple/Quaternion.lean`.

## Implementation notes

`EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.isAzumaya` is deliberately **not** an instance. Mathlib's
`Algebra.IsCentral.instIsAzumaya` goes the other way, deducing `Algebra.IsCentral K A` from
`IsAzumaya K A`; registering the converse as an instance would let typeclass search cycle between
the two. Apply it with `haveI` where an `IsAzumaya` hypothesis is wanted, as the worked example at
the end of this file does:

```lean
haveI := EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.isAzumaya K A
EpsilonEridani.Algebra.tensorOpAlgEquivMatrix K A hn
```

`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.tensorOpAlgEquivMatrix` takes the matrix size as a parameter `n` together with a
proof `Module.finrank K A = n`, rather than using `Module.finrank K A` itself. Instantiating `n` at
`Module.finrank K A` and `hn` at `rfl` recovers the unparametrized form, while the parametrized one
is what makes the quaternion example (where the dimension is `4` on the nose) come out without
reindexing. Its second half is `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.endAlgEquivMatrix`, which involves neither an
algebra structure nor central simplicity and so lives with the linear algebra, in
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/ToLin.lean`; nothing downstream should depend on which basis it
chooses.

the tensor product of a central simple algebra with its opposite is a full matrix algebra, which is

the two are related by `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.deg_sq`, and the resulting degree count is
