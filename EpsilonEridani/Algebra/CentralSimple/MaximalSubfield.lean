# Maximal subfields of a central division algebra

Let `K` be a field and `D` a finite-dimensional central division algebra over `K`.
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/CentralSimple/Subfield.lean` proves that a subfield of `D` has degree at most
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.deg K D`, and that a subfield attaining that bound splits `D`; what it leaves
open, in as many words, is whether the bound is attained at all. This file settles that: **`D` has
a subfield of degree exactly `deg K D`**, so the splitting field produced there is never vacuous
and every central division algebra is split by a finite extension of its centre sitting inside it.

The subfield is produced by maximality, in three steps.

*A commutative subalgebra of maximal dimension exists.* Dimensions of subalgebras of `D` are
bounded by `finrank K D`, so among the commutative ones there is a subalgebra `L` of largest
dimension (`EpsilonEridani.exists_isMulCommutative_forall_finrank_le`, in
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Algebra/Subalgebra/MaximalCommutative.lean`). Nothing about `D` is used here
beyond finite-dimensionality.

*It is its own centralizer.* If `x` centralizes `L` then `L` and `x` together generate a
commutative subalgebra `Algebra.adjoin K (insert x L)`, which contains `L`; maximal dimension makes
the containment an equality, so `x ∈ L`. This is
`EpsilonEridani.centralizer_eq_self_of_forall_finrank_le`, in the same file, and it is also what makes `L`
a *maximal* subfield rather than merely a large one.

Being a commutative domain, finite-dimensional over `K`, `L` is then a field
(`IsField.of_isDomain_of_finite`).

*Its dimension is forced.* For any subfield `L` of a finite-dimensional central simple algebra `A`,

  `finrank K L * finrank K C_A(L) = finrank K A`

(`EpsilonEridani.finrank_mul_finrank_centralizer_of_isField`, in
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/CentralSimple/Centralizer.lean`). Applied to `C_D(L) = L` this reads
`(finrank K L)² = finrank K D = (deg K D)²`, so `finrank K L = deg K D`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.exists_subalgebra_isField_finrank_eq_deg`: **a central division algebra has a
  subfield of degree `deg K D`.**
* `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.exists_isSplittingField_finrank_eq_deg`: **a central division algebra is split
  by a subfield of degree `deg K D`.**

## Implementation notes

Commutativity of a subalgebra is Mathlib's `IsMulCommutative` on its coercion to a type, which is
what `Algebra.isMulCommutative_adjoin` produces and what the scoped instances of the
`IsMulCommutative` namespace turn into a `CommRing` structure; the file therefore opens that scope,
which is what lets `IsField.of_isDomain_of_finite` apply to a commutative subalgebra of `D`.

The two ingredients that use nothing of the central simple theory are stated where they belong and
consumed here: the existence of a commutative subalgebra of maximal dimension and its being its own
centralizer in `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Algebra/Subalgebra/MaximalCommutative.lean`, the dimension of the
centralizer of a subfield beside the centralizer theorem it specializes in
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/CentralSimple/Centralizer.lean`.

The existence statements are stated for a **division** algebra. The passage from there to an
arbitrary central simple algebra `A ≃ₐ[K] Mₙ(D)`, and with it the index `ind A`, needs the
uniqueness of the division algebra in a Wedderburn presentation and is not done here.

/-- **A central division algebra has a subfield of degree `deg K D`.**

The subfield is delivered as a `Subalgebra K D` carrying `IsField`;
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.exists_isSplittingField_finrank_eq_deg` is the same subfield packaged as a field
in its own right, together with its embedding in `D`.

Together with `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.finrank_le_deg`, which bounds the degree of *every* subfield by
`deg K D`, this says `L` is a maximal subfield in the literal sense as well. -/

  -- A commutative subalgebra of `D` is a domain, and one finite over `K` is therefore a field.
  have hfield : IsField ↥L := IsField.of_isDomain_of_finite K ↥L

/-- **A central division algebra is split by a subfield of degree `deg K D`.**

This is the maximal-subfield route to a splitting field: unlike the passage to an algebraic
closure (`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.isSplittingField_of_isSepClosed`), it produces a splitting field that is
a *finite* extension of `K`, and one realized inside `D` by the accompanying homomorphism. -/

-- `_root_.` is needed because `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion` is also a namespace, so a bare
-- `open scoped Quaternion` would open that one and leave the `ℍ[·]` notation out of scope.

/-- **The real quaternions have a subfield of degree `2`.** The general theorem produces one
without exhibiting a copy of `ℂ` by hand. Which subfield it is takes the classification of the
finite extensions of `ℝ`, not proved here, to say: every degree-`2` extension of `ℝ` is
`ℝ`-isomorphic to `ℂ`. The example in `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/CentralSimple/Subfield.lean` exhibits a
copy of `ℂ` inside `ℍ[ℝ]` by hand instead. -/

/-- **A subalgebra of `ℍ[ℝ]` of degree `2` is not the base field**, so when `deg K D > 1` the
subfield produced above genuinely enlarges the centre; the existence theorem is not answered by
`K` itself. -/
