# Conjugation on the group algebra of a normal subgroup

Let `N` be a normal subgroup of a group `G`.  Conjugating by `g : G` is an automorphism of `N`
(`MulAut.conjNormal`), so it permutes the basis of the group algebra `k[N]` and therefore induces an
algebra automorphism of `k[N]`.  This file packages that automorphism as a monoid homomorphism
`MonoidAlgebra.conjNormalAlgAut : G →* (k[N] ≃ₐ[k] k[N])`, obtained by composing Mathlib's
`MonoidAlgebra.domCongrAut` with `MulAut.conjNormal`.

## Main definitions

* `MonoidAlgebra.conjNormalAlgAut`: conjugation by `g : G` as an algebra automorphism of `k[N]`.

## Main statements

* `MonoidAlgebra.conjNormalAlgAut_single`: conjugation acts on the group-algebra basis by
  conjugating the group element.

Conjugating by `g` and then by `g⁻¹` is the identity; that cancellation is left to `simp`, which
proves it from `map_inv` and `AlgEquiv.symm_apply_apply`.
