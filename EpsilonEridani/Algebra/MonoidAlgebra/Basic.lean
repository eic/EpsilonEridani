# Basic facts about monoid algebras

General facts about the monoid algebra `R[G]` that use only its basis elements `single g r`, and
none of the further theory built on it.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.single_sub_one_ne_zero`: over a nontrivial ring, the difference `single g 1 - 1`
  between the basis element at `g` and the unit is nonzero when `g ≠ 1`.
* The `IsMulCommutative (MonoidAlgebra R M)` instance: the monoid algebra of a commutative
  magma over a commutative semiring is commutative, as a mixin on the existing ring structure.

## References

Injectivity of `single` in its index is Mathlib's `MonoidAlgebra.single_left_injective`.
