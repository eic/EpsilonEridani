# Torsion in a character group

The group algebra of a group with torsion cannot be both reduced and connected over a field.
For torsion of order equal to the characteristic, the group algebra contains the familiar
nonzero nilpotent `g - 1`. For torsion of order prime to the characteristic, averaging over the
finite cyclic subgroup produces a nontrivial idempotent.

Consequently, if the group algebra of a commutative group is reduced and has connected prime
spectrum, then the group is torsion-free. This is the algebraic input that distinguishes tori
from general groups of multiplicative type.

Both hypotheses are needed. In exponential characteristic `p` the `p`-th power map of a monoid
algebra indexed by a `p`-torsion monoid is the `p`-th power of its counit, so every element differs
from a scalar by a `p`-nilpotent, and over a coefficient ring with connected prime spectrum the
monoid algebra again has connected prime spectrum, however much `p`-torsion the monoid carries.
The coordinate Hopf algebra of `μ_p` in characteristic `p` is the standard instance: connected,
not reduced, and with a character of order `p`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.groupAlgebraSubgroupAverage`: the normalized sum of a finite subgroup.
* `EpsilonEridani.isIdempotentElem_groupAlgebraSubgroupAverage`: the subgroup average is idempotent.
* `EpsilonEridani.isMulTorsionFree_of_isReduced_monoidAlgebra_of_connectedSpace`: reducedness and
  connectedness of a group algebra force its indexing group to be torsion-free.
* `EpsilonEridani.pow_expChar_monoidAlgebra_eq_algebraMap`: in exponential characteristic `p`, the
  `p`-th power map of a `p`-torsion monoid algebra is the `p`-th power of its counit.
* `EpsilonEridani.connectedSpace_primeSpectrum_monoidAlgebra_of_pow_eq_one`: over a coefficient ring with
  connected prime spectrum, a `p`-torsion monoid algebra in exponential characteristic `p` again
  has connected prime spectrum.

/-! ### Connectedness of a `p`-torsion group algebra in characteristic `p`

The two hypotheses of `isMulTorsionFree_of_isReduced_monoidAlgebra_of_connectedSpace` are
independent. Connectedness alone does not suffice: over a field of characteristic `p`, the group
algebra of a group killed by `p` is connected, while `not_isReduced_monoidAlgebra` shows it is not
reduced as soon as the group is nontrivial. The coordinate Hopf algebra of `μ_p` is the standard
instance. -/
