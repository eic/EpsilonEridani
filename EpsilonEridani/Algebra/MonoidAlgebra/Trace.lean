# The trace of multiplication by an element of a finite monoid algebra

For a finite monoid `G` the monoid algebra `k[G]` is free on the monoid elements, so multiplication
by a fixed element `x` is an endomorphism of a finite free module and has a trace. In the basis of
monoid elements the matrix of *right* multiplication by `x` has `g`-th diagonal entry `x_1`,
because `g * h = g` forces `h = 1` as soon as `G` cancels on the left; the trace is therefore
`|G| * x_1`, and it sees nothing of `x` beyond its coefficient at the identity. The same count on
the left needs cancellation on the right and gives the same answer, in the matrix form
`EpsilonEridani.trace_leftMulMatrix_monoidAlgebra` that the character-table files consume. A group cancels
on both sides, so all three statements apply to a finite group algebra.

The special case `x = g` recovers the character of the regular representation, but the general
statement is what identifies the scalar in an essential idempotence `c * c = a • c`, by pairing
with `EpsilonEridani.LinearMap.trace_eq_mul_finrank_range`.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.trace_leftMulMatrix_monoidAlgebra`: the matrix form, the trace of the left regular
  matrix of `x` is `|G| * x_1`.
* `EpsilonEridani.MonoidAlgebra.trace_mulRight`: the trace of right multiplication by `x` on `k[G]` is
  `|G| * x_1`.
* `EpsilonEridani.MonoidAlgebra.trace_mulLeft`: the same for left multiplication.
