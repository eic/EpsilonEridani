# Localizations of monoid algebras away from a monomial

Let `f : M →* N` be an injective homomorphism of commutative monoids and let `x : M` be an element
whose image is a unit of `N`. When every element of `N` becomes an element of the image of `f`
after multiplying by a sufficiently large power of `f x`, the induced map of monoid algebras
`R[M] → R[N]` is the localization away from the monomial of `x`.

This is the algebraic form of an open immersion of affine monoid schemes: in toric geometry, the
coordinate ring of the affine chart of a face `σ ∩ m^⊥` of a cone `σ` is obtained from the
coordinate ring of `σ` by inverting the monomial of `m`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.MonoidAlgebra.isLocalization_away_mapDomainRingHom`: the induced map of monoid
  algebras is a localization away from the monomial of `x`.
