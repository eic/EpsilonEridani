# Units and powers in groups with zero

Two elementary facts about a group with zero `G₀`.

A product `a ^ i * a⁻¹ ^ (n - i)`, in which the two exponents are natural numbers adding up to
`n`, is the integer power `a ^ (2 * i - n)`.  Such a product is what a diagonal matrix
`diag(a, a⁻¹)` contributes to a monomial of degree `n`, so the identity is the exponent
bookkeeping behind a weight computation.

Mathlib splits an integer power as a quotient (`zpow_sub₀`, `zpow_natCast_sub_natCast₀`) and
subtracts natural-number exponents (`pow_sub₀`, `inv_pow_sub₀`); this is the corresponding
statement for the exponents `i` and `n - i` of `a` and `a⁻¹`.

A monoid-with-zero homomorphism out of `G₀` carries units to units, and that is the only way one
of its values can be a unit: such a homomorphism is local, so a preimage of a unit is itself a
unit of `G₀`.  Membership of a unit in the range is therefore the same as being `Units.map` of a
unit, which is what turns a hypothesis about `Set.range (algebraMap F E)` into one about `Fˣ`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.pow_mul_inv_pow_eq_zpow₀`: `a ^ i * a⁻¹ ^ (n - i) = a ^ (2 * i - n)` for `i ≤ n`.
* `EpsilonEridani.mem_range_iff_exists_units_map_eq`: a unit lies in the range of a monoid-with-zero
  homomorphism out of a group with zero exactly when it is `Units.map` of a unit.

unit.** Such a homomorphism is local, so a preimage of a unit is a unit of `G₀`; conversely every
