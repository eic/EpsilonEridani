# Zero divisors in a word-filtered algebra are seen in its associated graded

Let `f : M →ₗ[R] A` be a linear family of generators of an algebra `A` and let
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.wordFiltration f` be the filtration it generates. This file proves the
**filtered-to-graded transfer of the domain property**: if the associated graded algebra
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.wordFiltration.AssociatedGraded f` has no zero divisors and the filtration is
exhaustive, then `A` has no zero divisors, and is a domain as soon as it is nontrivial. The
specialization to the PBW filtration of a universal enveloping algebra is
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/UniversalEnveloping/PBW/Domain.lean`.

The argument is the classical leading-term computation. An exhaustive filtration gives every
nonzero `a : A` a *leading degree*: the least `i` with `a ∈ F i`, which is the same as an `i` with
`a ∈ F i` and `a ∉ F_{i-1}`. Its **symbol** — the class of `a` in the graded piece `F i / F_{i-1}`
— is then nonzero, precisely because `a` is not in the preceding step. Symbols multiply: the
symbol of `a` in degree `i` times the symbol of `b` in degree `j` is the class of `a * b` in degree
`i + j`. If the graded product of the two nonzero symbols is nonzero, then `a * b` misses the step
`F_{i+j-1}`; in particular `a * b ≠ 0`, since `0` lies in every step. Nothing is needed of the
graded algebra beyond the vanishing behaviour of products of *homogeneous* classes, so the
hypothesis is stated in that form first and only then packaged as `NoZeroDivisors` of the whole
associated graded ring.

The converse fails, so this is a genuinely one-way transfer: the Clifford algebra of the
negative definite line over `ℝ` is `ℂ`, a field, while the associated graded of its degree
filtration is the exterior algebra of a line, which squares its generator to zero. What the
transfer buys is the standard route to the domain property for an algebra presented by generators
and relations — replace the relations by their leading terms and count there.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.wordFiltration.mul_notMem_wordFiltrationPrevious`: leading degrees add, when
  homogeneous products of nonzero classes are nonzero.
* `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.wordFiltration.noZeroDivisors_of_gradedMul_ne_zero`: the transfer, from the
  homogeneous hypothesis.
* `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.wordFiltration.gradedMul_ne_zero_of_noZeroDivisors`: that homogeneous
  hypothesis, read off the associated graded ring.
* `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.wordFiltration.noZeroDivisors_of_noZeroDivisors_associatedGraded` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.wordFiltration.isDomain_of_noZeroDivisors_associatedGraded`: the transfer, from
  the associated graded ring.
