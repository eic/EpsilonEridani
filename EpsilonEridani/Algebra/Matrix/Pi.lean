# Finite products of matrix algebras

The dimension and the center of a product `Π i, Matₙᵢ(k)` of matrix algebras over a field, both
read off the sizes `nᵢ` alone, together with the dimensions that an algebra equivalence
`A ≃ₐ[k] ∏ᵢ Matₙᵢ(Dᵢ)` onto such a product — over an arbitrary family of coefficient algebras
`Dᵢ` — transports back to the algebra `A` presented. Such a product is what a structure theorem of
Artin--Wedderburn type presents an algebra as, and these are the invariants such a presentation
transports; nothing here needs the presentation to come from Artin--Wedderburn, nor the
coefficients to be division algebras.

* `EpsilonEridani.finrank_pi_matrix`: over a semiring with the strong rank condition, the dimension of
  the product is `∑ᵢ nᵢ²`;
* `EpsilonEridani.centerPiMatrixAlgEquiv`: when every size is nonzero the center consists of the tuples of
  scalar matrices, so it is the algebra `ι → k` of functions on the index, whose dimension is the
  number of factors (`EpsilonEridani.finrank_center_pi_matrix`);
* `EpsilonEridani.finiteDimensional_of_algEquiv_pi_matrix`: the coefficient algebra of a block of *nonzero*
  size in a presentation of a finite-dimensional algebra is itself finite-dimensional. A block of
  size `0` is the zero ring whatever its coefficients are, so it constrains them not at all: the
  positivity hypothesis is essential rather than an artefact of the proof;
* `EpsilonEridani.finrank_eq_sum_sq_finrank`: **the dimension count** `finrank k A = ∑ᵢ nᵢ² · finrank k Dᵢ`
  for an algebra presented as `∏ᵢ Matₙᵢ(Dᵢ)`. The count itself needs no positivity: a block of size
  `0` contributes `0` to both sides;
* `EpsilonEridani.sq_le_finrank_of_algEquiv_pi_matrix` and `EpsilonEridani.card_le_finrank_of_algEquiv_pi_matrix`:
  the bounds `nᵢ² ≤ finrank k A` on the degree of a single block with nontrivial coefficients — no
  other block plays any part, so the index need not even be finite — and, when every block is
  nonzero over nontrivial coefficients, `Nat.card ι ≤ finrank k A` on the number of blocks.

No positivity is needed: a block of size `0` contributes `0` to both sides, whatever its
coefficients are. Only the presentation is used: `A` is not assumed semisimple, although by
`RingEquiv.isSemisimpleRing` it is one as soon as the coefficients `Dᵢ` are division algebras. -/
