# Reduction of commutative Hopf algebras

Let `H` be a commutative Hopf algebra over a reduced commutative ring. Its nilradical is
automatically stable under the counit and antipode. It is stable under comultiplication provided
the tensor square of the reduced algebra is reduced: the image of a nilpotent element under
comultiplication is nilpotent, hence vanishes in that tensor square. Thus reducedness of this
tensor square is a sufficient hypothesis for packaging the nilradical as a Hopf ideal.

The tensor-square hypothesis ensures that reduction commutes with the product used by the
comultiplication. It holds, in particular, for finite-type algebras over a perfect field once the
standard geometric-reducedness theorem is available. Keeping it explicit here separates the
Hopf-algebra argument from that commutative-algebra input.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.HopfIdeal.reduction`: the nilradical, packaged as a Hopf ideal.
* `EpsilonEridani.HopfIdeal.reduction_toIdeal`: its underlying ideal is the nilradical.
* `EpsilonEridani.HopfIdeal.mem_reduction`: membership is nilpotence.
* `EpsilonEridani.HopfIdeal.reduction_le_of_isReduced_quotient`: its minimality among Hopf ideals with
  reduced quotient.
