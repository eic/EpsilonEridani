# Bigraded Poincaré series

This file defines the Poincaré series of a finite-dimensional bigraded vector space, together
with its total dimension and Alexander-graded Euler characteristic.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.Series`: the Poincaré series of a finite-dimensional bigraded vector space.
* `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.totalDim`: the total dimension, as a ring homomorphism.
* `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.euler`: the Alexander-graded Euler characteristic.

/-- The Poincaré series of a finite-dimensional bigraded vector space: the dimension of the
summand in each bidegree `(Maslov, Alexander)`, all but finitely many of them zero.

Over a field, a bigraded vector space with only finitely many nonzero finite-dimensional summands
is determined up to bigraded isomorphism by this function, and the product is the Poincaré series
of the tensor product. -/
