# Bigraded vector spaces up to `⊗ W`-stabilization

Grid homology comes in a family of flavors whose blocked versions depend on the size of the
grid rather than on the link alone: the fully blocked homology of an `n × n` grid diagram
presenting an `ℓ`-component link `L` is the simply blocked grid homology of `L` tensored with
`W^{⊗(n-ℓ)}`, where `W` is the two-dimensional bigraded vector
space with one generator in bidegree `(0, 0)` and one in bidegree `(-1, -1)`. The link invariant
is therefore not the bigraded vector space itself but its class modulo tensoring with copies of
`W`. This file builds that quotient, together with the canonical representatives that make it
usable.

A finite-dimensional bigraded vector space over a field is determined up to bigraded isomorphism
by its dimension function, so the whole discussion takes place at the level of Poincaré series:
`EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.Series` is `ℕ[ℤ × ℤ]`, a finitely supported function assigning a dimension to
each bidegree `(Maslov, Alexander)`, with convolution as its product. Tensoring with `W` is
multiplication by `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.W`, and unwinding the convolution gives the expected
`(P * W)(m, a) = P(m, a) + P(m + 1, a + 1)`.

The quotient is not vacuous, and that is the substance here. Multiplication by `W` is injective
(`EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.mul_W_left_injective`), so no information beyond the number of stabilizations
is lost; note this genuinely uses finite support, since on unbounded bigraded vector spaces
tensoring with `W` is *not* injective. Consequently each stable class contains exactly one
`W`-indivisible series (`EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.exists_isReduced`,
`EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.IsReduced.eq_of_mul_W_pow_eq`), the reduced representative, and two series are
stably equivalent exactly when their reduced representatives agree
(`EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.isStablyEquiv_iff_reducedRep_eq`). Reduction is therefore a complete invariant
of a stable class.

Finally, the Alexander-graded Euler characteristic `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.euler` records how much the
stabilization actually costs: it is a ring homomorphism to the Laurent polynomials sending `W` to
`1 - T⁻¹`, so stabilizing `k` times multiplies the Euler characteristic by `(1 - T⁻¹)^k`. That is
exactly the factor by which the grid state sum of an `n × n` diagram differs from the Alexander
polynomial of the link it presents, so the Euler characteristic is an invariant of a stable class
only after that factor is divided out.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.Series`: the Poincaré series of a finite-dimensional bigraded vector space.
* `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.W`: the Poincaré series of the stabilization factor `W`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.totalDim`: the total dimension, as a ring homomorphism.
* `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.IsStablyEquiv`, `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.StableSeries`: the stabilization
  equivalence and the quotient it defines.
* `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.IsReduced`, `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.reducedRep`: `W`-indivisibility and the
  canonical representative of a stable class.
* `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.euler`: the Alexander-graded Euler characteristic.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.coeff_mul_W` and `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.coeff_mul_W_pow`: tensoring with `W`
  adds the diagonal shift by `(1, 1)`, and iterating it adds binomial multiples of the shifts.
* `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.mul_W_left_injective`: tensoring with `W` is injective.
* `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.exists_isReduced` and `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.IsReduced.eq_of_mul_W_pow_eq`: every
  series is a stabilization of a unique reduced one.
* `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.isStablyEquiv_iff_reducedRep_eq`: the reduced representative is a complete
  invariant of a stable class.
* `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.reduce_injective` and `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.stableEquivReduced`: the reduced
  representative identifies the quotient with the `W`-indivisible series.
* `EpsilonEridani.Bigraded.euler_mul_W_pow`: stabilizing multiplies the Euler characteristic by
  `1 - T⁻¹`.

## References

This supplies the stabilization convention of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/CombinatorialHeegaardFloer/README.md`, Lane ALG, which asks for the "graded
vector space up to `⊗W`-stabilization" quotient "as API, not ad hoc", and which Lane G.5 needs to
state which of the blocked grid homologies is a link invariant. The bigraded conventions follow
Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for Knots and Links*, Chapters 4 and 5, where
`W` is the bigraded vector space with generators in bidegrees `(0, 0)` and `(-1, -1)`.
