# The centre of the Hamilton quaternions

The Hamilton quaternions `ℍ[R]` over a commutative ring `R` are the free `R`-module on `1, i, j, k`
with `i² = j² = k² = -1`. This file computes their centre, and deduces that `ℍ[R]` is a *central*
`R`-algebra whenever `2` is a regular element of `R`. Over `ℝ` this makes `ℍ[ℝ]` a central simple
`ℝ`-algebra, since a division ring is a simple ring; the file closes by showing that this central
simple algebra is not split, that is, not isomorphic to a matrix algebra over `R`.

The computation runs through `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.commute_iff`, which says that two quaternions
commute exactly when `2` annihilates the three coordinates of the cross product of their imaginary
parts. That criterion holds over an arbitrary commutative ring, with no regularity assumption: in
characteristic two `ℍ[R]` really is commutative, and the criterion records that degeneration rather
than excluding it.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.commute_iff`: two quaternions commute iff `2` annihilates the cross product
  of their imaginary parts, and `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.commute_iff'`, its classical form for `2`
  regular: two quaternions commute iff the cross product of their imaginary parts vanishes, that
  is, iff the three `2 × 2` minors of the pair of imaginary parts all vanish. Over a field that is
  the statement that the imaginary parts are parallel; over a general commutative ring vanishing
  minors are weaker than one imaginary part being a scalar multiple of the other.
* `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.mem_center_iff`: a quaternion is central iff `2` annihilates each of its
  three imaginary coordinates.
* `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.center_eq_bot`: if `2` is left regular in `R`, the centre of `ℍ[R]` is the
  image of `R`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.instIsCentral`: `ℍ[R]` is a central `R`-algebra when `R` has no zero divisors
  and `2 ≠ 0` in `R`. This is the roadmap's `quaternion_isCentral` at `R = ℝ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.isEmpty_algEquiv_matrix`: over a linearly ordered commutative ring, `ℍ[R]` is
  not isomorphic to a matrix algebra of size at least two, so over a field its Brauer class is
  nontrivial.

## Implementation notes

The Hamilton computation here is for `Quaternion R = ℍ[R]`, with `i² = j² = k² = -1`. The centre
genuinely depends on the structure constants, and the general algebra need not be central even over
`ℝ`. For instance in
`ℍ[ℝ, 0, 0, 0]` the products of `k` with each imaginary unit all vanish (`i * k = k * i = 0`,
`j * k = k * j = 0` and `k * k = 0`), so `k` is a central element outside the image of `ℝ`; the
other products of imaginary units are not all zero there, since `i * j = k` and `j * i = -k`.

The regularity hypothesis of `center_eq_bot` is carried as `IsLeftRegular (2 : R)`, which is exactly
what the proof consumes. `instIsCentral` restates it with the typeclass assumptions
`[NoZeroDivisors R] [NeZero (2 : R)]` so that instance search can discharge it; the roadmap's target
`R = ℝ` is an instance of that form.

## References

This file implements the Hamilton-quaternion worked example of Layer 6 in
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/SemisimpleAlgebras/README.md`, whose `Suggested.lean` pins it
as `quaternion_isCentral`. The centrality of `ℍ` and the nonsplitting statement are the two halves
of the classical computation of the Brauer group of `ℝ`; see for instance P. Gille and
T. Szamuely, *Central Simple Algebras and Galois Cohomology*, CUP (2006), §1.1 and §2.1.

No regularity assumption on `2` is made, so the statement also covers characteristic two, where
`ℍ[R]` is commutative and all three conditions hold vacuously. -/

Commuting with `i` and with `j` already forces all three conditions, and conversely those conditions

quaternion. -/
