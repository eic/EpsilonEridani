# Centrality descends from a matrix algebra to its coefficients

Mathlib proves that a matrix algebra over a central algebra is central
(`Algebra.IsCentral.matrix`). This file supplies the converse over a nonempty finite index type:
the centre of `Matrix ι ι D` is the image of the centre of `D` under the scalar embedding
`Matrix.scalarAlgHom`, which is injective as soon as `ι` is nonempty, so the centre of `D` is `⊥`
whenever the centre of `Matrix ι ι D` is.

* `EpsilonEridani.isCentral_of_isCentral_matrix`: if `Matrix ι ι D` is central over `K`, then so is `D`;
* `EpsilonEridani.isCentral_matrix_iff` packages this with Mathlib's converse.

## Implementation notes

`EpsilonEridani.isCentral_of_isCentral_matrix` is deliberately *not* an instance: its hypothesis mentions
`Matrix ι ι D` while its conclusion mentions only `D`, so instance search could not run it
backwards, and the index type `ι` is unconstrained by the goal.

/-- If a matrix algebra `Matrix ι ι D` over a nonempty finite index type is central over `K`, then
its coefficient algebra `D` is central over `K`.

The centre of `Matrix ι ι D` is the image of the centre of `D` under the scalar embedding
`Matrix.scalarAlgHom`, which is injective because `ι` is nonempty; so the centre of `D` is `⊥` as
soon as the centre of the matrix algebra is. This is the converse of `Algebra.IsCentral.matrix`. -/
