# The coordinate ring of `μ_p` is non-reduced in characteristic `p`

For a commutative group `G`, the diagonalizable group `D(G)` over `R` is `Spec R[G]`, with
coordinate Hopf algebra the group algebra `R[G]`. By `EpsilonEridani.not_isReduced_monoidAlgebra`,
`R[G]` fails to be reduced whenever `R` has prime characteristic `p` and `G` has a nontrivial
element killed by `p`.

The headline application is the **non-smooth example `μ_p` in characteristic `p`** from the
reductive-groups roadmap: `μ_p = D(ℤ/p)` has coordinate Hopf algebra
`R[Multiplicative (ZMod p)]`, whose `A`-points are the `p`-th roots of unity in `A`
(`EpsilonEridani.RootsOfUnityGroup.pointsMulEquiv`), yet which is non-reduced over a base of
characteristic `p`. Geometric reducedness of the coordinate ring is exactly smoothness for a
group scheme of finite type over a field, so this exhibits `μ_p` as a non-smooth (non-reduced)
affine group scheme, the canonical example the roadmap flags for admitting non-smooth groups.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.RootsOfUnityGroup.coordinateRing_not_isReduced`: the coordinate Hopf algebra of
  `μ_p = D(ℤ/p)` is not reduced over a nontrivial base of characteristic `p`.
* `EpsilonEridani.RootsOfUnityGroup.isNilpotent_single_generator_sub_one`: the explicit nonzero
  nilpotent `single (ofAdd 1) 1 - 1`.

This is a worked-example check for the reductive-groups roadmap
(`ReductiveGroups/README.md` in EpsilonEridaniRoadmap): the standing hypotheses note that an affine
group scheme of finite type "admits `μ_p`, `αₚ`, and other non-smooth / non-reduced groups", and
Layer 4 names "the non-smooth example `μ_p` in characteristic `p`" in the diagonalizable-groups
lane.
