# The tangent Lie algebra of the additive group

The vector group represented by `SymmetricAlgebra R M` has `B`-valued tangent module
`M →ₗ[R] B`. Concretely, a counit-valued derivation is determined by its values on the
generators `SymmetricAlgebra.ι R M x`, and every linear assignment of generator values extends
uniquely to such a derivation. `AdditiveGroup.tangentLinearEquiv` packages this as an `R`-linear
equivalence. Specializing to `M = R` gives
`AdditiveGroup.gaTangentLinearEquiv`, the identification of the tangent module of `𝔾ₐ` with
`B`.

Over commutative rings, the convolution bracket of two tangent derivations is zero. It is enough
to calculate on a generator: the generator is primitive, so both convolution products vanish
there. Thus the tangent Lie algebra of every additive vector group is abelian.

The inverse tangent construction uses `SymmetricAlgebra.mkDerivation`: a linear map
`f : M →ₗ[R] B` extends uniquely from the canonical generators. No choice of basis or finiteness
hypothesis on `M` is needed.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.AdditiveGroup.tangentLinearEquiv`: tangent derivations of a vector group are linear
  maps from its coordinate module.
* `EpsilonEridani.AdditiveGroup.gaTangentLinearEquiv`: the tangent module of `𝔾ₐ` is the coefficient
  algebra `B`.
* `EpsilonEridani.AdditiveGroup.tangent_bracket_eq_zero`: the tangent Lie bracket is zero.

This advances Layer 2 (`Lie(G)`) and the additive-group worked example of the
ReductiveGroups roadmap.

/-- A tangent derivation annihilates every power other than the first of a coordinate

The generator of a vector group is primitive, so its counit vanishes; the Leibniz rule then
leaves the factor `ι(x) ^ (k - 1)`, which acts on the counit coefficient algebra through that
vanishing counit. Only the linear term of a coordinate function survives differentiation at
the identity, which is what makes a differential read off a linear coefficient. -/
