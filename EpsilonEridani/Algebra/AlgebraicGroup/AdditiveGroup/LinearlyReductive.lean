# The additive group is not linearly reductive

Over any field the additive group `𝔾ₐ` is unipotent in the strong sense that every nonzero
comodule over its coordinate algebra `k[x]` contains a nonzero fixed vector
(`EpsilonEridani.AdditiveGroup.exists_ne_zero_coact_eq_tmul_one`, Kolchin's theorem for `𝔾ₐ`, which needs
neither algebraic closedness nor finite-dimensionality). That supply of fixed vectors is exactly
what `EpsilonEridani.HopfAlgebra.comul_eq_tmul_one_of_isLinearlyReductive_of_forall_exists_fixed` asks
for, so a linearly reductive `𝔾ₐ` would have `Δ h = h ⊗ 1`, hence `h = ε(h) · 1`, for every `h`.
The coordinate algebra is a polynomial algebra and its coordinate `x` has counit `0`, so `𝔾ₐ` is
not linearly reductive over any field.

This is the worked example that gives the triviality theorem content: unipotent groups other than
the trivial one exist, so complete reducibility genuinely fails for them. It is also the promised
counterexample on the linear-reductivity side of Layer 6 of the ReductiveGroups roadmap, matching
the diagonalizable groups on the positive side.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.AdditiveGroup.not_isLinearlyReductive`: the coordinate algebra of `𝔾ₐ` over a field is
  not linearly reductive.
* `EpsilonEridani.AdditiveGroup.not_linearlyReductiveCommHopfAlgProperty_coordinateHopfAlgebra`: the same
  statement for the object property.
