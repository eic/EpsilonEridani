# Base change of the bundled coordinate Hopf algebra of `𝔾ₐ`

`EpsilonEridani.AdditiveGroup.gaScalarTensorBialgEquiv` identifies `K ⊗[k] O(𝔾ₐ)` with the coordinate
bialgebra of `𝔾ₐ` over `K`. This file bundles that equivalence as an isomorphism in
`CommHopfAlgCat K`, so that the base change of `𝔾ₐ` over `k` *is* `𝔾ₐ` over `K` as a commutative
Hopf algebra, and not merely as a bialgebra.

The antipode needs no separate argument: a bialgebra map between Hopf algebras automatically
commutes with the antipodes, which is what `CommHopfAlgCat.isoMk` uses.

The bundled form is what a consumer of a *presentation* needs. It is an abbreviation so that the
existing simp lemmas for `gaScalarTensorBialgEquiv` apply directly to its forward and inverse
maps. A closed subgroup scheme of a group scheme over `k` is a Hopf-ideal quotient of its coordinate
Hopf algebra; base-changing that presentation produces a quotient of `K ⊗[k] O(G)`, and reading the
result as a closed subgroup scheme over `K` means transporting along an isomorphism in
`CommHopfAlgCat K`. This is the
`𝔾ₐ` companion of `EpsilonEridani.GeneralLinear.coordinateHopfAlgebraBaseChangeIso`, and, as there, the
extension ring's carrier universe must contain the base ring's; the unbundled bialgebra
equivalence has no such restriction.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.AdditiveGroup.coordinateHopfAlgebraBaseChangeIso`: the bundled isomorphism.

## References

The underlying equivalence is `EpsilonEridani.AdditiveGroup.gaScalarTensorBialgEquiv`, itself the
rank-one case of `EpsilonEridani.SymmetricAlgebra.scalarTensorBialgEquiv`. This advances the base-change
half of Layer 9 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`. See W. C. Waterhouse,
*Introduction to Affine Group Schemes*, §1, and J. S. Milne, *Algebraic Groups* (2017), §2.
