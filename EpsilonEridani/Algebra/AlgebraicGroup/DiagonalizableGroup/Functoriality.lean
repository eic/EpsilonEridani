# Functoriality of the diagonalizable group in the abelian group

`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.DiagonalizableGroup.Basic` computes the functor of points of the
diagonalizable group `D(G) = Spec R[G]`: for every commutative `R`-algebra `A`, the
convolution group of `R`-algebra maps `R[G] →ₐ[R] A` is the character group `G →* Aˣ`. This
file records the remaining variance, making `D` into a **contravariant functor** on commutative
groups: a group homomorphism `φ : G →* G'` induces a homomorphism of group functors
`D(φ) : D(G') → D(G)`, and under the character identification this is just **precomposition**
`χ ↦ χ ∘ φ` of characters.

Concretely `φ` induces, by `MonoidAlgebra.mapDomainBialgHom`, the bialgebra map
`R[G] →ₐc[R] R[G']`, which `EpsilonEridani.AlgHom.mapDomain` turns into a monoid homomorphism
`WithConv (R[G'] →ₐ[R] A) →* WithConv (R[G] →ₐ[R] A)` of convolution groups. The headline
calculation `pointsMulEquiv_pointsMap` says this monoid homomorphism is intertwined by
`pointsMulEquiv` with precomposition by `φ` on character groups, so the contravariant functor
`G ↦ D(G)` agrees on points with the contravariant functor `G ↦ (G →* Aˣ)`. This is the
on-points half of the roadmap's anti-equivalence `M ↦ D(M)`.

This advances the reductive-groups roadmap (Layer 4, "diagonalizable groups and groups of
multiplicative type: the anti-equivalence `M ↦ D(M)`"), building on the diagonalizable-group
worked example and the coordinate-Hopf-algebra functoriality `AlgHom.mapDomain`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.DiagonalizableGroup.pointsMap`: the homomorphism of convolution groups of points
  induced by a group homomorphism `φ : G →* G'`, contravariantly.
* `EpsilonEridani.DiagonalizableGroup.pointsMap_id`, `EpsilonEridani.DiagonalizableGroup.pointsMap_comp`:
  the contravariant functoriality of `pointsMap`.
* `EpsilonEridani.DiagonalizableGroup.mapValue_pointsMap`: `pointsMap` is natural in the value
  algebra, commuting with `AlgHom.mapValue`.
* `EpsilonEridani.DiagonalizableGroup.charOfPoint_comp`: reading off the character of a precomposed
  point is precomposition of the character by `φ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.DiagonalizableGroup.pointsMulEquiv_pointsMap`: the points homomorphism is
  intertwined by `pointsMulEquiv` with precomposition of characters by `φ`.

## References

The group-algebra bialgebra functoriality `MonoidAlgebra.mapDomainBialgHom` is Mathlib's
(`Mathlib.RingTheory.Bialgebra.MonoidAlgebra`). The convolution-group functoriality in the
coordinate Hopf algebra is Tau Ceti's `EpsilonEridani.AlgHom.mapDomain`
(`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.Hopf.Map`). This realizes the diagonalizable-group
functoriality of the Tau Ceti reductive-groups roadmap (Layer 4).
