# Power endomorphisms of `𝔾ₘ` and the ring map `ℤ → End(𝔾ₘ)`

`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.Cocharacter` introduces, for the multiplicative group
`𝔾ₘ = D(Multiplicative ℤ)`, the `n`th power endomorphism `DiagonalizableGroup.powEnd n`, defined
through the diagonalizable-group functoriality as the character of `𝔾ₘ` at the generator power
`Multiplicative.ofAdd n`. It records that these power endomorphisms compose by multiplying
exponents (`powEnd_comp`) with `powEnd 1 = id` (`powEnd_one`) — the multiplicative half of the
ring `End(𝔾ₘ) ≅ ℤ` "on the level of power maps".

This file completes that picture. The key bridge is that the abstractly-defined endomorphism
`powEnd z` acts on the convolution group of points as the genuine `z`th power map:
`powEnd z f = f ^ z` (`DiagonalizableGroup.powEnd_apply`). From this the remaining ring structure
follows: `powEnd 0` is the trivial homomorphism (`powEnd_zero`), the exponent-additive law
`powEnd (a + b) = powEnd a * powEnd b` holds for the pointwise product of endomorphisms
(`powEnd_add`), and `powEnd (-a)` inverts pointwise (`powEnd_neg`). Passing to additive notation
on the abelian group of `𝔾ₘ`-points, the family realizes the canonical integer action
(`toAdditive_powEnd_eq_intCast`), i.e. the power endomorphisms are the power-map realization of
Mathlib's canonical ring homomorphism `Int.castRingHom` into `End(𝔾ₘ(A))`. On
the group of points of a *fixed* algebra `A` this map need not be injective (for instance when
`Aˣ` has finite exponent), so it is honestly only a ring homomorphism, not an isomorphism.

The power-map description also reads off the character–cocharacter pairing directly: composing
a character `m` after a cocharacter `ψ` of `D(M)` raises a `𝔾ₘ`-point to the `⟨m, ψ⟩` power
(`DiagonalizableGroup.charPoints_cocharPoints_apply`).

This improves the existing power-endomorphism and character–cocharacter pairing API supporting
the reductive-groups roadmap (`ReductiveGroups/README.md` in EpsilonEridaniRoadmap, Layer 4: "Tori ...
the character lattice `X*(T)` and cocharacter lattice `X_*(T)` with their perfect pairing").

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DiagonalizableGroup.powEnd_apply`: `powEnd z f = f ^ z`, the power endomorphism as the
  genuine power map on the convolution group of points.
* `EpsilonEridani.DiagonalizableGroup.powEnd_zero`, `EpsilonEridani.DiagonalizableGroup.powEnd_add`,
  `EpsilonEridani.DiagonalizableGroup.powEnd_neg`: the additive-in-the-exponent structure of the power
  endomorphisms, complementing the existing multiplicative `powEnd_comp` / `powEnd_one`.
* `EpsilonEridani.DiagonalizableGroup.toAdditive_powEnd_eq_intCast`: the additive form of `powEnd z`
  is the value of Mathlib's canonical integer ring homomorphism.
* `EpsilonEridani.DiagonalizableGroup.charPoints_cocharPoints_apply`: the character–cocharacter pairing
  is the exponent of the power map obtained by composing a character after a cocharacter.
