# Naturality of the tangent and adjoint actions in the coefficient algebra

For a bialgebra `A` over `R`, the tangent space is naturally a functor of the
coefficient algebra:

`B ↦ Derivation R A (Bialgebra.CounitAlgebra R A B)`.

An `R`-algebra homomorphism `φ : B →ₐ[R] C` postcomposes a counit-valued
derivation. The underlying maps of counit algebras are defined in `Tangent.Basic`;
this file packages postcomposition as `Derivation.mapValue`, proves its
functoriality, and, when `A` is a Hopf algebra, shows that it intertwines the adjoint
actions at `B` and `C`.
Together, these statements make the valuewise representations in
`Tangent.Adjoint` into a natural action on the Lie functor.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Bialgebra.CounitAlgebra.mapAlgHom`: the coefficient algebra map.
* `EpsilonEridani.Bialgebra.CounitAlgebra.map`: the same map, linear over the bialgebra
  through the counit actions.
* `Derivation.mapValue`: postcomposition of counit-valued derivations.
* `Derivation.mapValue_adDerivation`: the adjoint action commutes with
  change of coefficient algebra.

The Lie-bracket compatibility, which requires additive inverses, is in
`Tangent.Lie.Naturality`.
