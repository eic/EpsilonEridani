# The Lie algebra of the tangent space

Directory aggregator: importing this module provides the Lie algebra structure
on counit-valued derivations (`Lie.Basic`), the differential as a Lie algebra
morphism (`Lie.Map`), and the compatibility of the adjoint action with the bracket
(`Lie.Adjoint.Basic` and `Lie.Adjoint.Cotangent`), the cotangent-dual model (`Lie.Cotangent`),
change of coefficient algebra (`Lie.Naturality`), base change of the coordinate
algebra with invariance of Lie dimension (`Lie.BaseChange`), and the identification
of the infinitesimal adjoint action with the Lie bracket (`Lie.Adjoint.Infinitesimal`).
