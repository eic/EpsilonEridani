# Surjectivity of the Lie differential of a formally smooth morphism

A formally smooth morphism of affine monoid schemes induces a surjective Lie algebra
morphism on tangent spaces at the identity, with values in any commutative coefficient
algebra. For affine groups, this gives the surjectivity needed for the Lie-dimension
formula for a scheme-theoretic kernel.
