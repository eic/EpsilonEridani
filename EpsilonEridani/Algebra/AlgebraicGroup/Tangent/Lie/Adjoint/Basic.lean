# The adjoint action respects the Lie bracket

`Derivation.adDerivation` conjugates a tangent vector by a point of the Hopf algebra.
`Tangent.Adjoint` shows that this is an action by linear automorphisms; this file adds the
one statement that needs the Lie structure of `Tangent.Lie.Basic`, namely that each `Ad g` is
an automorphism of the Lie bracket rather than merely of the module.

It is kept out of `Tangent.Adjoint` so that the non-Lie tangent aggregator does not re-export
the Lie-algebra structure.

## Main results

* `Derivation.adDerivation_lie`: `Ad g ⁅d₁, d₂⁆ = ⁅Ad g d₁, Ad g d₂⁆`.
