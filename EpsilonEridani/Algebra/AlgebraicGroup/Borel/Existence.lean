# Existence of Borel subgroups

A Borel subgroup of an affine algebraic group over an algebraically closed field is a maximal
smooth, geometrically connected, geometrically solvable closed subgroup. This file proves existence
by maximizing Lie dimension. More precisely, every Borel candidate is contained in a maximal one.
Applying this on the geometric fibre of a group over an arbitrary field constructs a Borel subgroup
there.

The identity subgroup makes the family of candidates nonempty. For the relative statement, a
candidate containing a prescribed one is again a nonempty family. Lie dimensions of closed
subgroups are bounded by the ambient Lie dimension, and equality of Lie dimensions detects
equality for an inclusion of smooth connected closed subgroups. This is exactly the general
maximal-dimension argument in `HopfIdeal.exists_minimal_of_smooth_of_connected`.

The resulting Borel lives over the algebraic closure. It need not descend to the original field:
the existence of a Borel defined over a non-algebraically-closed field is an additional condition
on the group. No conjugacy statement is proved here.

/-- **Every smooth, geometrically connected, geometrically solvable closed subgroup is contained

In Hopf-ideal order the inequality `J ≤ I` says that the closed subgroup cut out by `J` contains
the one cut out by `I`. Thus the returned minimal Borel candidate is a maximal smooth,
geometrically connected, geometrically solvable subgroup containing the prescribed candidate. -/

/-- **Every finite-type affine group over a field has a maximal smooth geometrically connected

Over an algebraically closed field this is a Borel subgroup. Over a general field it is only
maximal among candidates defined over that field; `exists_geometricBorel` below applies the result
after extension to an algebraic closure. -/

/-- **The geometric fibre of every finite-type affine group has a Borel subgroup.**

The conclusion is stated directly on the base-changed coordinate Hopf algebra. Since the base
field there is algebraically closed, `IsBorelOverAlgClosed` is precisely minimality among smooth,
geometrically connected, geometrically solvable closed subgroups. -/
