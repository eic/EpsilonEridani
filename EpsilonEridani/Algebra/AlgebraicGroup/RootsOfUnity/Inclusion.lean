# The inclusion `μ_n ↪ 𝔾ₘ` on points

The group scheme of `n`th roots of unity `μ_n = D(ℤ/n)` is a closed subgroup of the
multiplicative group `𝔾ₘ = D(ℤ)`. For positive `n` this is the usual finite `μ_n`; the
declarations below are polymorphic in `n : ℕ` and also cover the degenerate case `n = 0`, where
`ℤ/0 = ℤ` and `μ_0 = 𝔾ₘ`. On the diagonalizable side the inclusion is
**contravariant** to the quotient homomorphism `ℤ ↠ ℤ/n`: writing that quotient
multiplicatively as `φ : Multiplicative ℤ →* Multiplicative (ZMod n)`, the diagonalizable
functor sends it to a homomorphism of group functors `D(φ) : D(ℤ/n) → D(ℤ)`, i.e.
`μ_n → 𝔾ₘ`, given on points by precomposition with the surjection `R[Multiplicative ℤ] ↠
R[Multiplicative (ZMod n)]` of coordinate Hopf algebras.

This file records that this points homomorphism is, under the two worked-example
identifications, exactly the inclusion of `n`th roots of unity into the unit group: reading
the image `μ_n(A) → 𝔾ₘ(A)` on the group-algebra generator `Multiplicative.ofAdd 1` of `𝔾ₘ`
returns the underlying unit of the root of unity. The same statement holds against the
canonical Laurent-polynomial `𝔾ₘ` of `EpsilonEridani.MultiplicativeGroup`, and the inclusion is
injective (a monomorphism of functors) and natural in the value algebra.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.RootsOfUnityGroup.toMultiplicativeZMod`: the quotient homomorphism `ℤ ↠ ℤ/n` written
  multiplicatively, `Multiplicative ℤ →* Multiplicative (ZMod n)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.RootsOfUnityGroup.inclusion`: the inclusion `μ_n ↪ 𝔾ₘ` on points, the contravariant
  image of `toMultiplicativeZMod n` under the diagonalizable functor.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.RootsOfUnityGroup.charOfPoint_inclusion`: reading the character of an included point
  is the `μ_n` character precomposed with the quotient `ℤ ↠ ℤ/n`.
* `EpsilonEridani.RootsOfUnityGroup.charOfPoint_inclusion_ofAdd_one`: reading the included point on the
  `𝔾ₘ` generator `Multiplicative.ofAdd 1` returns the underlying unit of the root of unity.
* `EpsilonEridani.RootsOfUnityGroup.multiplicativeGroup_pointEquiv_inclusion`: the same identification
  against the canonical Laurent-polynomial `𝔾ₘ` of `EpsilonEridani.MultiplicativeGroup`.
* `EpsilonEridani.RootsOfUnityGroup.inclusion_injective`: the inclusion is injective on points, so
  `μ_n → 𝔾ₘ` is a monomorphism of group functors.
* `EpsilonEridani.RootsOfUnityGroup.mapValue_inclusion`: the inclusion is natural in the value algebra.

This is a worked-example check for the reductive-groups roadmap
(`ReductiveGroups/README.md` in EpsilonEridaniRoadmap, Layer 4: "`μ_n = D(ℤ/n)`", "`𝔾_m = D(ℤ)`",
and the diagonalizable anti-equivalence `M ↦ D(M)`), assembling the `μ_n` and `𝔾ₘ` worked
examples through the diagonalizable-group functoriality `DiagonalizableGroup.pointsMap`.

## References

The contravariant functoriality of the diagonalizable group is Tau Ceti's
`EpsilonEridani.DiagonalizableGroup.pointsMap`; the `μ_n` and `𝔾ₘ` points calculations are
`EpsilonEridani.RootsOfUnityGroup.pointsMulEquiv` and `EpsilonEridani.MultiplicativeGroup.pointEquiv`. The
multiplicative quotient `ℤ ↠ ℤ/n` uses Mathlib's `AddMonoidHom.toMultiplicative` and
`Int.castAddHom`.
