# Characters of a unipotent affine group

Let `H` be the reduced finite-type coordinate Hopf algebra of an affine group over a field `k`,
and let `K` be an algebraically closed extension of `k`. If every `K`-valued point of the group is
unipotent, then every group-like element of `H` is one. In geometric language, every algebraic
character of the group is trivial.

The argument combines two independent inputs. A unipotent point evaluates every group-like
element at one, by the rank-one representation attached to that element. Algebraically closed
points separate elements of a reduced finite-type algebra, so an element evaluated as one by all
points is itself one. The conclusion does not require connectedness: the pointwise unipotence
hypothesis is already strong enough.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GroupLike.eq_one_of_forall_algHom_apply_eq_one`: a group-like element evaluated as one
  at every algebraically closed point is one.
* `EpsilonEridani.groupLike_eq_one_of_forall_isUnipotentPoint`: every algebraic character is trivial when
  all algebraically closed points are unipotent.
* `EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_groupLike_of_forall_isUnipotentPoint`: the character group is
  subsingleton under the same hypotheses.

This completes the "no nontrivial characters" consequence in Layer 5, "Unipotent groups", of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`.
