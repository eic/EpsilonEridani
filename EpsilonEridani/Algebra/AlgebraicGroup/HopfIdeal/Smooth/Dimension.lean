# Comparing smooth connected closed subgroups by Lie dimension

Let `H` be the coordinate Hopf algebra of a finite-type affine group over a field. A closed
subgroup is encoded contravariantly by a Hopf ideal, so `I ≤ J` says that the subgroup cut out by
`I` contains the one cut out by `J`. Lie dimension is antitone in the defining ideal, and this
file proves that it detects equality among smooth connected closed subgroups: an inclusion which
does not drop the Lie dimension is an equality.

The proof is the conormal-sequence argument. The quotient-to-quotient coordinate map is
surjective, and equality of tangent-space dimensions makes it bijective on tangent Lie algebras,
hence its conormal space vanishes; smoothness and connectedness then upgrade the infinitesimal
statement to equality of Hopf ideals.

Two consequences follow formally. A member of maximal Lie dimension in a family of smooth
connected closed subgroups is a maximal member of that family, and every nonempty such family has
a maximal member. No closure hypothesis on the family is needed: unlike the product argument used
for the unipotent and solvable radicals, this gives maximality rather than a greatest element.

/-- An inclusion of smooth connected closed subgroups which does not drop the Lie dimension is an
equality.

The order on Hopf ideals reverses inclusion of the represented closed subgroups, so `I ≤ J` says
that the subgroup cut out by `I` contains the one cut out by `J`, and the dimension hypothesis is
the reverse of the automatic inequality. -/

/-- A member of maximal Lie dimension in a family of smooth connected closed subgroups is a
maximal member of that family.

Only the members contained in the given one need to be dimension-dominated by it, which is what
makes the statement usable for families cut out by an auxiliary containment condition. -/

/-- Every nonempty family of smooth connected closed subgroups has a maximal member.

Maximality of the represented closed subgroup is minimality of its defining Hopf ideal. The Lie
dimensions attained by the family form a nonempty set of natural numbers bounded by the Lie
dimension of the ambient group, so a maximal-dimensional member exists and is maximal. -/
