# Generalized points of Hopf-ideal quotient inclusions

This file identifies composition with the categorical closed-subgroup inclusion represented by a
Hopf-ideal quotient with the usual precomposition map on algebra-valued points.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.CommHopfAlgCat.grpObjPointsMulEquiv_comp_quotientGrpObjInclusion`: the represented
  quotient inclusion acts on generalized points by the quotient-points homomorphism.

## References

This is the generalized-point form of the Layer 3 Hopf-ideal/closed-subgroup dictionary in the
ReductiveGroups roadmap. It combines the represented group-object Yoneda equivalence with the
point-level quotient API.
