# The reduced quotient of an affine group

This file packages the quotient by the generic nilradical Hopf ideal from
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.HopfAlgebra.HopfIdeal.Reduction` as a commutative Hopf-algebra object and records
that its underlying coordinate ring is reduced.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.HopfIdeal.isReduced_quotient_reduction`: the resulting quotient is reduced.
