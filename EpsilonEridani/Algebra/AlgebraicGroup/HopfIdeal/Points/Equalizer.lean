# Points of the equalizer of two homomorphisms of affine group schemes

The quotient by `EpsilonEridani.CommHopfAlgCat.equalizerHopfIdeal` cuts out a subgroup of each point
group. This file identifies that subgroup: an `A`-point of `K` lies in it exactly when the two
morphisms induce the same map on it, which is the defining condition of the equalizer subfunctor.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.CommHopfAlgCat.mem_quotientPointsSubgroup_equalizerHopfIdeal_iff`: on points, the
  subgroup cut out by the equalizer Hopf ideal is where the two induced maps agree.

## References

The equalizer of two homomorphisms of group schemes is a closed subgroup scheme, described on
points by exactly this condition; see [Milne, *Algebraic Groups*][milne2017], §1.h, and Waterhouse,
*Introduction to Affine Group Schemes*, §15.3. It serves
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`, "Hopf ideals ↔ closed subgroup schemes".
