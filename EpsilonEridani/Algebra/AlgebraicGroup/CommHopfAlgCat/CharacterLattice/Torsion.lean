# The characters of a geometrically reduced, geometrically connected affine group are torsion free

A geometric character of an affine group `Spec H` is a group-like element of the coordinate Hopf
algebra of its base change to an algebraic closure. This file proves that when `H` is
geometrically reduced and geometrically connected, no geometric character has finite order, and
records the corollary for a smooth geometrically connected affine group.

Over the algebraic closure the argument is a reduction to the diagonalizable case. Group-like
elements of a Hopf algebra over a field are linearly independent, so evaluation embeds the group
algebra on them into `H`. A subring of a reduced ring is reduced, and connectedness of a prime
spectrum descends along an injective ring homomorphism, so both hypotheses pass to that group
algebra, where
`EpsilonEridani.isMulTorsionFree_of_isReduced_monoidAlgebra_of_connectedSpace` already rules out torsion.

Neither hypothesis can be dropped. Connectedness alone fails in characteristic `p`, where the
coordinate Hopf algebra of `μ_p` is connected, non-reduced, and carries a character of order `p`.
Reducedness alone fails for the constant group `ℤ/n` over a field containing a primitive `n`-th
root of unity: its coordinate algebra is reduced but disconnected, and it has characters of
order `n`.

Contravariantly, a homomorphism from `Spec H` to the diagonalizable group `D(M)` is a morphism of
coordinate bialgebras `k[M] ⟶ H`. Torsion-freeness therefore says that a smooth geometrically
connected affine group admits no nontrivial homomorphism to a diagonalizable group on a torsion
group, so in particular no nontrivial `μ_n`-quotient.
