# Points of faithfully flat affine group morphisms

Let `f : H ⟶ K` be a morphism of commutative Hopf algebras over a commutative ring `R`.
Contravariantly, it represents an affine group morphism from `Spec K` to `Spec H`. If the
underlying algebra map is faithfully flat and of finite type, this morphism is surjective on
points valued in every algebraically closed field over `R`.

The algebraic point-lifting theorem is
`AlgHom.surjective_comp_right_of_faithfullyFlat`. The result here records it in the group-valued
functor-of-points API, where precomposition is the component of
`CommHopfAlgCat.mapPointsFunctor f`.

## Main declaration

* `EpsilonEridani.CommHopfAlgCat.mapPointsFunctor_app_surjective_of_faithfullyFlat`: a faithfully flat
  finite-type coordinate morphism induces a surjection on algebraically closed points.

## References

This is the group-valued point-lifting interface used in Layer 5, "The unipotent radical", of the
ReductiveGroups roadmap. Applied to the faithfully flat morphism from an affine group onto its
scheme-theoretic image, it lets properties of source points descend to all image points.

/-- A faithfully flat finite-type morphism of commutative Hopf algebras is surjective on points
valued in an algebraically closed field.

The conclusion is stated for the component of the group-valued points functor, rather than for
bare algebra maps, so it can be used directly with group-theoretic point properties. -/
