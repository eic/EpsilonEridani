# Geometric solvability of affine groups

For a commutative Hopf algebra `H` over a field `k`, this file records the geometric-points
solvability condition: the convolution group of `AlgebraicClosure k`-valued points of `H` is a
solvable abstract group. Smoothness and finite type are deliberately not built into this property;
consumers must state them separately when interpreting it as the classical notion of a solvable
algebraic group.

The property is invariant under coordinate-Hopf-algebra isomorphisms. It is preserved by closed
subgroups, represented contravariantly by surjective coordinate morphisms, and a product has the
property exactly when both factors do. These are the first subgroup-calculus operations needed for
Lie--Kolchin theory and the construction of the solvable radical.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.geometricallySolvablePointsCommHopfAlgProperty`: solvability of the geometric point
  group.
* `EpsilonEridani.geometricallySolvablePointsCommHopfAlgProperty_of_isCocomm`: commutative affine
  groups have solvable geometric points.
* `EpsilonEridani.geometricallySolvablePointsCommHopfAlgProperty_of_surjective`: closure under closed
  subgroups.
* `EpsilonEridani.geometricallySolvablePointsCommHopfAlgProperty_tensorProduct_iff`: solvability of a
  product is equivalent to solvability of both factors.

This begins the "Lie--Kolchin; solvable groups" milestone in Layer 5 of the ReductiveGroups
roadmap. The scheme-theoretic derived subgroup and its comparison with this geometric-points
criterion remain to be constructed.
