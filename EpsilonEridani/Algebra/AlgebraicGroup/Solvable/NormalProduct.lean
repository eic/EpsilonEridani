# Solvability of normal products

Let `I` and `J` cut out smooth solvable closed subgroups of an affine group, with
`I` normal. Multiplication is a homomorphism from their conjugation semidirect product into the
ambient group, and `CommHopfAlgCat.productOfNormal` is its scheme-theoretic image.

The semidirect-product source is smooth and has solvable geometric points. Its coordinate map
from the multiplication image is injective, so solvability descends by the derived-word identity
criterion for schematically dense morphisms. No faithful-flatness hypothesis on the
source-to-image morphism is needed.

## Main declaration

* `EpsilonEridani.geometricallySolvablePointsCommHopfAlgProperty.productOfNormal`: the multiplication
  image of two smooth solvable subgroups has solvable geometric points.

This supplies the geometric-solvability part of binary-product closure for connected normal
smooth solvable closed subgroups in Layer 6, "Reductive and semisimple groups", of the
ReductiveGroups roadmap.

/-- The scheme-theoretic multiplication image of two smooth solvable closed subgroups has
solvable geometric points when the first subgroup is normal.

The conjugation semidirect-product source is smooth and solvable. The canonical coordinate map
from the image into that source is injective, so the derived-word identity for solvability
descends to the image. -/
