# Extensions of geometrically solvable affine groups

Let `f : H ⟶ K` be a morphism of commutative Hopf algebras over a field `k`. Contravariantly,
it represents a homomorphism from the affine group represented by `K` to the one represented by
`H`. This file proves that the source group of geometric points is solvable when the target and
the scheme-theoretic kernel are solvable.

On coordinate rings, the kernel has algebra

```text
K / K·f(H⁺),
```

implemented as `CommHopfAlgCat.quotient K (CommHopfAlgCat.kernelHopfIdeal f)`. Its geometric
points map injectively into those of `K`, with image exactly the kernel of the map induced by
`f`. Mathlib's abstract extension theorem for solvable groups then applies directly. Conversely,
a closed subgroup of a geometrically solvable affine group has solvable geometric points, so the
kernel condition is also necessary once the source is solvable.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.geometricallySolvablePointsCommHopfAlgProperty_of_kernel`: geometric solvability is
  closed under extensions.
* `EpsilonEridani.geometricallySolvablePointsCommHopfAlgProperty_iff_kernel`: when the target is
  geometrically solvable, the source is geometrically solvable exactly when its kernel is.

This supplies extension closure for the "Lie--Kolchin; solvable groups" milestone in Layer 5 of
the ReductiveGroups roadmap. Together with closed-subgroup and product closure, it is part of the
subgroup calculus needed for the solvable radical in Layer 6.

/-- Geometric-point solvability is closed under extensions.

For the group homomorphism represented by `f : H ⟶ K`, assume that the target `Spec H` and
the scheme-theoretic kernel `Spec (K / K·f(H⁺))` have solvable groups of geometric points.
Then the geometric point group of the source `Spec K` is solvable. -/

/-- If the target of a homomorphism is geometrically solvable, then its source is geometrically
solvable exactly when its scheme-theoretic kernel is.

The forward implication is closed-subgroup stability, applied to the quotient coordinate map.
The reverse implication is extension closure. -/
