# Geometric solvability under field extension

Let `H` be a finite-type commutative Hopf algebra over a field `k`, and let `K / k` be any field
extension. Geometric solvability of the affine group represented by `H` is equivalent to geometric
solvability after extending scalars to `K`.

Preservation under scalar extension is proved in
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.Solvable.Reduced`: finite-type point separation turns solvability
into a universal derived-word identity, which remains valid over `K`. This file proves reflection.
Choose a `k`-embedding of `AlgebraicClosure k` into `AlgebraicClosure K`. Postcomposition embeds
the original geometric point group into the points valued in `AlgebraicClosure K`, and the standard
base-change equivalence identifies the latter with the geometric point group of `K ⊗[k] H`.
Solvability passes to subgroups, giving the result.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.geometricallySolvablePointsCommHopfAlgProperty.of_baseChange`: geometric solvability is
  reflected by arbitrary field extension.
* `EpsilonEridani.geometricallySolvablePointsCommHopfAlgProperty.baseChange_iff`: geometric solvability is
  invariant under arbitrary field extension for finite-type affine groups.

## References

* J. S. Milne, *Algebraic Groups* (2017), §§6.45--6.46.
* A. Borel, *Linear Algebraic Groups*, §11.21.

This supplies the two-way scalar-extension interface needed to compare solvable radicals in
Layer 6, "Reductive and semisimple groups", of the ReductiveGroups roadmap.
