# Connected components of finite-type affine groups

The prime spectrum of the coordinate ring of a finite-type affine group over a Noetherian
commutative ring has finitely many connected components, and each component is clopen. The Hopf
structure is not needed for this finiteness statement: finite type over a Noetherian ring makes
the coordinate ring Noetherian, and a Noetherian topological space has finitely many connected
components.

## Main declaration

* `EpsilonEridani.FiniteTypeCommHopfAlgCat.instFiniteConnectedComponents`: the connected components of
  the spectrum of a finite-type commutative Hopf algebra form a finite type.

## References

* J. S. Milne, *Algebraic Groups* (2017), Section 2.a.
* The Stacks Project, Tag 0052, *Noetherian topological spaces*.

This is the finiteness prerequisite for Layer 3 of the ReductiveGroups roadmap. The later
component-group construction will put a finite group-scheme structure on these components; this
file establishes the underlying finiteness and clopen decomposition.
