# Morphisms from connected affine groups to finite constant groups

Let `H` be the coordinate Hopf algebra of a connected affine group over a field
`k`, and let `G` be a finite group. Every group-scheme morphism from `Spec H` to the constant
group scheme attached to `G` is trivial. Contravariantly, every bialgebra morphism

```text
  k^G ⟶ H
```

is the composite of the counit of `k^G` and the unit of `H`.

The proof uses the characteristic functions of the elements of `G`. Their images are
idempotents in `H`, hence are zero or one because `Spec H` is connected. Compatibility with the
counit determines which alternative occurs: the characteristic function of the identity maps to
one, and all the others map to zero. The same computation shows that the induced map on points
has constant value the identity.

This is the connectedness input in the Lie--Kolchin induction. The derived subgroup first
produces finitely many weight spaces permuted by the ambient group; the result here makes the
resulting morphism to that finite permutation group trivial. In that application geometric
connectedness supplies connectedness of the coordinate ring after extension to an algebraic
closure.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.ConstantGroup.bialgHom_eq_unit_comp_counit_of_connected`: a morphism from
  a connected affine group to a finite constant group is trivial in Hopf coordinates.
* `EpsilonEridani.ConstantGroup.point_comp_eq_one_of_connected`: the induced map on
  algebra-valued points is constantly the identity.

This advances the "Lie--Kolchin; solvable groups" milestone in Layer 5 of the ReductiveGroups
roadmap.

/-- **Every morphism from a connected affine group to a finite constant group is
trivial.**

In coordinate Hopf algebras, a morphism to the constant group attached to `G` is a bialgebra
homomorphism from its function algebra to `H`. It is necessarily the counit followed by the
unit. -/
