# Geometric reducedness of products of affine groups

The coordinate algebra of a direct product of affine groups is the tensor product of their
coordinate algebras. For affine groups of finite type over a field, geometric reducedness is
equivalent to smoothness, and smoothness is preserved by products. It follows that the tensor
product of two geometrically reduced coordinate Hopf algebras of finite type is geometrically
reduced.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.geometricallyReducedCommHopfAlgProperty.tensorProduct`: finite-type geometrically
  reduced affine groups are closed under direct products.
