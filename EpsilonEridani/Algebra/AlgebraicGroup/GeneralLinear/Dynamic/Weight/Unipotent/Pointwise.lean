# Unipotence of represented weight-cocharacter subgroups

Let `w : Fin N → ℤ` and let `λ_w` be the corresponding diagonal cocharacter of `GL_N`.
The dynamic subgroup `U(λ_w)(A)` consists of the matrices which are block triangular for the
weight filtration and induce the identity on its associated graded. The coordinate Hopf algebra
`GeneralLinear.weightUnipotentCoordinateHopfAlgebra k w` represents this subgroup.

This file proves that every point of that coordinate Hopf algebra over a same-universe perfect
extension field is unipotent in the representation-theoretic sense. The defining Hopf ideal cuts
out the dynamic unipotent subgroup, so the general quotient-point theorem applies.

Smoothness and geometric connectedness of the represented subgroup require an explicit
description of its coordinate ring and are not asserted here.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.GeneralLinear.Dynamic.isUnipotentPoint_weightUnipotentCoordinateHopfAlgebra`: every
  perfect-extension-valued point of a represented weight-unipotent subgroup is unipotent.
* `geometricallyUnipotentPointsCommHopfAlgProperty_weightUnipotentCoordinateHopfAlgebra`: the
  represented subgroup has geometrically unipotent points.

This advances the dynamic parabolic and Levi route in Layer 7, "Structure theory", of the
ReductiveGroups roadmap by proving the unipotence property of the represented unipotent factor.
