# Nilpotence of upper-unitriangular group points

The convolution points of the coordinate Hopf algebra of `U_n` are naturally equivalent to the
ordinary upper-unitriangular matrix group. The matrix group is nilpotent over every commutative
ring, so this equivalence makes every value of the represented group functor nilpotent, and hence
solvable.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.UpperUnitriangular.isNilpotent_points`: every group of algebra-valued points of `U_n`
  is nilpotent.
* `EpsilonEridani.UpperUnitriangular.isSolvable_points`: every such point group is solvable.

## References

* T. A. Springer, *Linear Algebraic Groups*, §2.4.
* J. C. Jantzen, *Representations of Algebraic Groups*, I.2.

This is the upper-unitriangular case of the solvability target in Layer 5 of the ReductiveGroups
roadmap. Once the upper-unitriangular embedding characterization is complete, subgroup closure
transfers this result to every smooth connected unipotent affine group.
