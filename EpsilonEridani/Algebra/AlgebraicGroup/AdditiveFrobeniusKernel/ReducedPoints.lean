# Points of `αₚ` over reduced algebras

The Frobenius kernel `αₚ` has nontrivial points only on algebras with nilpotents.  More
precisely, its points on a commutative algebra `A` are the elements whose `p`-th power
vanishes.  If `A` is reduced, such an element is zero, so the `p`-nilpotent subgroup is
trivial and the convolution group `αₚ(A)` has one element.

This is an important qualification to the non-reduced worked example: although the group
scheme `αₚ` itself is nontrivial, it is invisible on every reduced test algebra.  In
particular its field-valued points are trivial.  Non-reduced test algebras, such as dual
numbers, are required to detect it.

The proofs use the description of the functor of points in
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.AdditiveFrobeniusKernel.Basic` and Mathlib's
`eq_zero_of_pow_eq_zero` for reduced rings.

This develops the worked example `αₚ` in the Tau Ceti reductive-groups roadmap
(`ReductiveGroups/README.md` in EpsilonEridaniRoadmap), whose standing hypotheses require the
theory to retain non-smooth and non-reduced group schemes such as `αₚ`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.AlphaP.pNilpotent_eq_bot_of_isReduced`: the subgroup of `p`-nilpotent
  elements of a reduced algebra is trivial.
* `EpsilonEridani.AlphaP.points_eq_one_of_isReduced`: every `αₚ`-point over a reduced algebra
  is the identity point.
* `EpsilonEridani.AlphaP.instUniquePointsOfIsReduced`: the convolution group of points has a
  unique element over a reduced algebra.
* `EpsilonEridani.AlphaP.reducedPointsMulEquivPUnit`: the resulting canonical equivalence with
  the trivial group.
