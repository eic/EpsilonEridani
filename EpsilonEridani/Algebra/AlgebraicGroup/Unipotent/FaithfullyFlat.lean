# Unipotence under faithfully flat morphisms

Let `f : H ⟶ K` be a finite-type faithfully flat morphism of commutative Hopf algebras over a
field. Contravariantly, every algebraically closed point of `Spec H` lifts to a point of
`Spec K`, so geometric unipotence descends from `K` to `H`.

Unipotence is preserved when a point is precomposed with a Hopf-algebra morphism. Point lifting
along `f` therefore transfers geometric unipotence from its source affine group to its target.

## Main declaration

* `EpsilonEridani.geometricallyUnipotentPointsCommHopfAlgProperty.of_faithfullyFlat`: geometric
  unipotence descends along a finite-type faithfully flat coordinate morphism.

## References

* The Stacks Project, Tags 00HQ and 00FV, for algebraically closed points of faithfully flat
  finite-type algebras.

This is an algebraically-closed-point bridge for Layer 5, "The unipotent radical", of the
ReductiveGroups roadmap.
