# Closed subgroups of smooth unipotent affine groups

A closed subgroup of an affine group is represented contravariantly by a surjective morphism of
coordinate Hopf algebras. This file proves that geometric-point unipotence descends along such a
morphism. Consequently, a smooth closed subgroup of a smooth unipotent affine group is again
smooth unipotent.

The pointwise argument uses naturality and uniqueness of Jordan decomposition. If `f : H ⟶ K`
is surjective and a `K`-point `g` becomes unipotent after precomposition with `f`, naturality says
that the semisimple part of `g` also becomes the identity after precomposition. Surjectivity makes
precomposition injective on points, so the semisimple part of `g` was already the identity.

Smoothness of the subgroup is retained as an explicit hypothesis. It cannot be deduced from the
closed immersion: in positive characteristic, the nonsmooth group scheme `αₚ` is a closed subgroup
of the smooth unipotent group `𝔾ₐ`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.HopfAlgebra.isUnipotentPoint_mapDomain_iff_of_surjective`: unipotence is reflected by
  precomposition with a surjective coordinate morphism.
* `EpsilonEridani.geometricallyUnipotentPointsCommHopfAlgProperty_of_surjective`: geometric unipotence
  descends to a quotient coordinate Hopf algebra.
* `EpsilonEridani.smoothUnipotentCommHopfAlgProperty_of_surjective`: a smooth quotient of a
  geometrically unipotent finite-type coordinate Hopf algebra is smooth unipotent.
* `EpsilonEridani.smoothUnipotentCommHopfAlgProperty_quotient`: the preceding result for the quotient by
  a Hopf ideal, hence for a smooth closed subgroup scheme.

This is a closure result needed in Layer 5, "Unipotent groups", of the ReductiveGroups roadmap.
It supplies a basic input for comparing connected normal unipotent closed subgroups in the
construction of the unipotent radical.

Contravariantly, this says that a point of a closed subgroup is unipotent exactly when its image
in the ambient affine group is unipotent. -/
