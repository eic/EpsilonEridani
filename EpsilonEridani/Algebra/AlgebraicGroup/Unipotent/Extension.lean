# Extensions of smooth unipotent affine groups

Let `f : H ⟶ K` be a morphism of commutative Hopf algebras over a field `k`. In the
contravariant affine-group dictionary it represents a homomorphism `Spec K ⟶ Spec H`. This
file proves the pointwise extension principle: a point of `Spec K` is unipotent when its image in
`Spec H` is unipotent and every point in the kernel of the homomorphism is unipotent.

The proof uses Jordan decomposition rather than a chosen representation. Naturality sends the
semisimple part of the original point to the semisimple part of its unipotent image, hence to the
identity. The semisimple part therefore belongs to the kernel closed subgroup. If every kernel
point is unipotent, this semisimple point is both semisimple and unipotent, so it is the identity.

On coordinate rings, the kernel closed subgroup has algebra

```text
K / K·f(H⁺),
```

implemented as `CommHopfAlgCat.quotient K (CommHopfAlgCat.kernelHopfIdeal f)`. The resulting
object-property theorem says that geometric-point unipotence of `Spec K` is equivalent to that of
the kernel whenever `Spec H` is geometrically unipotent. The final statements combine this with
the explicit smoothness hypothesis used by `smoothUnipotentCommHopfAlgProperty`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.HopfAlgebra.IsUnipotentPoint.of_mapDomain_of_kernel`: the pointwise extension
  principle.
* `EpsilonEridani.geometricallyUnipotentPointsCommHopfAlgProperty_of_kernel`: geometric-point
  unipotence is closed under extensions.
* `EpsilonEridani.geometricallyUnipotentPointsCommHopfAlgProperty_iff_kernel`: when the target is
  geometrically unipotent, the source is geometrically unipotent exactly when its kernel is.
* `EpsilonEridani.smoothUnipotentCommHopfAlgProperty_iff_smooth_and_kernel`: the corresponding
  characterization for a smooth finite-type source.

This supplies the extension-closure step in Layer 5, "Unipotent groups", of the ReductiveGroups
roadmap. Together with closed-subgroup and product closure, it is part of the subgroup calculus
needed to construct and compare connected normal unipotent closed subgroups in the unipotent
radical.

Here the kernel hypothesis is expressed pointwise: it applies to precisely those `K`-points whose
precomposition along `f` is the identity `H`-point. The object-level results below identify this
condition with points of the quotient by `CommHopfAlgCat.kernelHopfIdeal`. -/

Smoothness of the source remains explicit. This theorem proves the unipotence part of extension
closure; it does not assert smoothness of the middle group from exactness hypotheses that are not
