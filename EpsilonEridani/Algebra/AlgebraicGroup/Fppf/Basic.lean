# Affine-group points on the affine fppf site

For a commutative ring `R`, the category `(CommAlgCat R)ᵒᵖ` is the category of affine schemes
over `Spec R`. The imported generic affine-site module equips it with the fppf topology induced by
Mathlib's fppf topology on schemes over `Spec R`. Thus a presheaf on this site has the expected
variance

```text
CommAlgCat R ⥤ Type.
```

For a commutative Hopf algebra `H`, the imported Yoneda module registers the underlying type-valued
presheaf of convolution points `A ↦ WithConv (H →ₐ[R] A)` as representable. Its representability
and subcanonicity imply that affine-group points form an fppf sheaf.

This is the affine-site foundation for fppf sheafification of pointwise quotients. It does not
assert that such a quotient sheaf is representable; representability requires separate hypotheses.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.HopfAlgebra.pointsPresheaf_isSheaf`: affine-group points satisfy fppf descent.
* `EpsilonEridani.HopfAlgebra.pointsFppfSheaf`: affine-group points bundled as an fppf sheaf.

## References

* J. S. Milne, *Algebraic Groups* (2017), Sections 2 and 5.
* W. C. Waterhouse, *Introduction to Affine Group Schemes*, Sections 1 and 14.

This advances the cross-cutting sheaves-and-descent prerequisite and Layer 3, "Normality and
quotients", of the ReductiveGroups roadmap. The next step is to sheafify the existing pointwise
quotient presheaf and prove its quotient universal property in the fppf topos.
