# Central closed subgroups of semisimple affine groups

Let `H` be the coordinate Hopf algebra of a semisimple affine group over a field `k`. This file
proves that every smooth geometrically connected central closed subgroup of the geometric fibre
is trivial.

A central Hopf ideal is normal, and its quotient coordinate Hopf algebra is cocommutative.
Consequently the represented subgroup has a commutative, hence solvable, group of geometric
points. The defining universal property of semisimplicity then identifies its defining ideal with
the augmentation ideal.

The theorem deliberately retains smoothness. In positive characteristic a semisimple group can
have a non-smooth connected central subgroup scheme, such as an infinitesimal subgroup of its
centre, so removing that hypothesis would be false. The result is the central-subgroup input for
the finite-centre and adjoint-form steps: once a smooth connected central subgroup has been
constructed, no separate solvability argument is needed to show that it is trivial.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.semisimpleCommHopfAlgProperty.eq_augmentation_of_isCentral`: every smooth
  geometrically connected central closed subgroup of a semisimple group's geometric fibre is
  trivial.

This advances Layer 6, "Reductive and semisimple groups", of the ReductiveGroups roadmap. It is
the central-subgroup triviality step used in proving that the centre of a semisimple group is
finite and in constructing its adjoint form.

/-- **A smooth geometrically connected central closed subgroup of a semisimple affine group's
geometric fibre is trivial.**

The Hopf ideal `I` cuts out the subgroup contravariantly. Thus triviality is the equality of `I`
with the augmentation ideal. Centrality supplies both normality and cocommutativity of the
quotient; the latter makes its geometric point group commutative and therefore solvable. -/
