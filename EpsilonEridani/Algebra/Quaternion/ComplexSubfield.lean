# The two embeddings of `ℂ` in the quaternions are conjugate

Complex conjugation on the copy of `ℂ` inside the real quaternions is conjugation by `j`:

`ofComplex (conj z) = j * ofComplex z * j⁻¹`.

This is the second half of the "Skolem-Noether in the small" worked example of the semisimple
algebras roadmap; the first half, that every `ℝ`-algebra automorphism of `ℍ[ℝ]` is inner, is an
example in `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/CentralSimple/SkolemNoether.lean`, read straight off
`EpsilonEridani.exists_unit_conj_of_algEquiv`.

The two halves are not the same theorem. `EpsilonEridani.skolemNoether` conjugates two `K`-algebra maps
`B →ₐ[K] A` when **both** `A` and `B` are central simple over `K`, and `ℂ` is not central over `ℝ`:
its centre is all of `ℂ`, not the image of `ℝ`. Centrality of the source cannot simply be dropped
either -- the negative control in that same file exhibits complex conjugation as an `ℝ`-algebra
automorphism of `ℂ` that is **not** inner in `ℂ`. So the statement above is an instance of the
noncentral Skolem-Noether theorem, which that roadmap defers, and it is proved here by hand.

The proof uses none of the central simple machinery. An `ℝ`-algebra map `ℂ →ₐ[ℝ] A` is the same
thing as a square root of `-1` in `A` (Mathlib's `Complex.lift`), so what has to be proved is that
any two square roots of `-1` in `ℍ[ℝ]` are conjugate. Given `x * x = u * u = -1`, the element
`w = 1 - u * x` satisfies `w * x = u * w`, both sides being `x + u`; and `w` vanishes exactly when
`u * x = 1`. Since `x⁻¹ = -x`, that excluded case is `u = -x`, and for `x = i` it is settled by
`j`, which anticommutes with `i`. So every square root of `-1` is conjugate to `i`, hence any two
are conjugate to each other. Complex conjugation is exactly the excluded case, which is why `j` is
the witness the roadmap names.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.jUnit`: the quaternion `j`, as a unit of the division ring `ℍ[ℝ]`.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.conj_jUnit_ofComplex_I`: conjugation by `j` negates `i`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.exists_unit_conj_of_mul_self_eq_neg_one`: any two square roots of `-1` in
  `ℍ[ℝ]` are conjugate by a unit.
* `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.exists_unit_conj_complexAlgHom`: **noncentral Skolem-Noether for
  `ℂ ⊆ ℍ[ℝ]`** -- any two `ℝ`-algebra maps `ℂ →ₐ[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ]` are conjugate by a unit of `ℍ[ℝ]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.ofComplex_conjAe`: **complex conjugation on `ℂ ⊆ ℍ[ℝ]` is conjugation by
  `j`**, the roadmap's statement, with the explicit witness.

## Implementation notes

Squares are written `u * u = -1` rather than `u ^ 2 = -1`, matching the subtype
`{I' // I' * I' = -1}` that Mathlib's `Complex.lift` is stated over, so that no `sq`/`pow`
translation is needed where the universal property is used. That universal property is consumed
rather than restated: the square relation is `(Complex.lift.symm f).prop`, and the coordinate
formula for an `ℝ`-algebra map out of `ℂ` is `Complex.lift.apply_symm_apply` followed by
`Complex.liftAux_apply`.

Two steps of the argument are stated as `private` lemmas because they are wanted only here, and in
a generality -- any division ring for the conjugacy of the square roots of `-1`, any `ℝ`-algebra
for the detection of a conjugacy on `Complex.I` -- that no statement of this file uses.

`EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.jUnit` carries its inverse as data rather than being built with `Units.mk0`
from a nonvanishing proof: `↑jUnit⁻¹` is then a quaternion literal definitionally, which turns the
one coordinate computation of the file into a rewrite rather than a division. The body is not
exposed, so the two coercion lemmas below are proved `(rfl)` rather than `rfl`.

The two coordinate identities are stated with the type ascriptions written out, `(⟨0, 0, 1, 0⟩ :
ℍ[ℝ]) * …`, and are consumed by `exact`/`rw` rather than being inlined into the proofs that need
them. `Quaternion R` is a plain `def` for `ℍ[R,-1,-1]`, so an ascribed anonymous constructor
elaborates at the *unfolded* type and `QuaternionAlgebra.mk_mul_mk` applies to it, whereas the same
literal reached through a declaration of type `ℍ[ℝ]` does not match that `simp` lemma at all and
the product stays stuck. Neither `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.coe_jUnit` nor
`EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.coe_inv_jUnit` is a `simp` lemma for the same reason: rewriting with them puts
a literal where nothing can act on it unless the goal is already in the ascribed form.
