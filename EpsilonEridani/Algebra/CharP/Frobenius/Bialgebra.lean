# The Frobenius endomorphism of a commutative bialgebra over a finite field

Let `S` be a commutative bialgebra over a finite field `K`. Its algebra map is injective, so the
`#K`-power map is a ring endomorphism of `S` and of its tensor square. On the tensor square that
endomorphism is the tensor square of the one on `S`, so it respects comultiplication, and the
counit lands in `K`, where the `#K`-power map is the identity. The `#K`-power map is therefore a
morphism of bialgebras.

Contravariantly this is the Frobenius endomorphism of the affine monoid scheme represented by `S`.
When `S` is a Hopf algebra, this is an affine group-scheme endomorphism. On points over a
`K`-algebra, it raises every coordinate to its `#K`-th power.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.frobeniusBialgHom`: the `#K`-power map as a bialgebra endomorphism.

## References
