# The augmentation point of a commutative bialgebra

The counit of a commutative bialgebra over a field defines a point of its prime spectrum. For a
Hopf algebra, this is the identity point of the represented affine group.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Bialgebra.augmentationPoint`: the point of the affine spectrum defined by the counit.
