# The permutation representation of a group action on an enumerated set

A group `G` acting on a set `α` with `n` elements permutes them, and choosing an enumeration
`e : α ≃ Fin n` turns that into a homomorphism `G →* Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`. This file is that
transport and the price of the choice.

The action on `α` is the intrinsic object and needs no choices. A symmetric group does not
appear until `e` is chosen, and the point is that the choice costs exactly one conjugation and
no more:

* the representation `permutationRepresentation e` depends on `e`;
* but `permutationRepresentation e'` is conjugate to it inside `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`, by the
  re-indexing permutation `e.symm.trans e'` (`permutationRepresentation_eq_conj`), and the same
  holds of the images (`map_permutationRepresentation_range_conj`).

So the action is canonical, while the resulting subgroup of a particular symmetric group is
canonical only up to conjugacy. This is the same phenomenon as Mathlib's
`Polynomial.Gal.galActionHom`, which acts on `p.rootSet E` rather than on `Fin p.natDegree` for
the same reason.

`permutationRepresentation` needs no hypothesis. When the action is faithful it is injective,
and `permutationEmbedding` bundles that as the injection `G ↪ S_n` into the ambient symmetric
group; the isomorphism onto the image is `MonoidHom.ofInjective
(permutationRepresentation_injective e)`, which needs no wrapper here.

The motivating case is a Galois group permuting the embeddings of a field: `G = M ≃ₐ[F] M`
acting on `L →ₐ[F] M` by postcomposition (`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/GroupAction/AlgHom.lean`), where
`EpsilonEridani/FieldTheory/Normal/Embeddings.lean` supplies faithfulness from the generation
hypothesis as `faithfulSMul_of_normalClosure_eq_top`.

## Main results

* `Equiv.permutationRepresentation`: the representation `G →* Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` attached to an
  enumeration `e` of `α`.
* `Equiv.permutationRepresentation_apply`: it acts by `i ↦ e (g • e.symm i)`.
* `Equiv.permutationRepresentation_injective`: it is injective when the action is faithful.
* `Equiv.permutationEmbedding`: the injection `G ↪ Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`, with
  `Equiv.permutationEmbedding_apply` identifying its values.
* `Equiv.permutationRepresentation_eq_conj` and
  `Equiv.map_permutationRepresentation_range_conj`: replacing the enumeration conjugates the
  representation, and its image.

/-- **The represented subgroups of `S_n` are conjugate**, by the same re-indexing permutation.
This is the subgroup-level form of `permutationRepresentation_eq_conj`, and it is what makes
