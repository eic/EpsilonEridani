# Algebra maps out of a product that factor through a coordinate

An algebra map `φ : A × C →ₐ[F] B` does not restrict to the first factor on the nose, because
`a ↦ (a, 0)` is not unital and so is not an algebra map.  It does restrict once `φ (1, 0) = 1`:
that hypothesis supplies exactly the missing unitality, and `a ↦ φ (a, 0)` is then an algebra map
`A →ₐ[F] B`.

This is why there is no `AlgHom.inl` upstream to compose with, and what
`AlgHom.prodFirst` provides instead.

## Main declarations

* `AlgHom.prodFirst`: the first-coordinate algebra map attached to `φ` with `φ (1, 0) = 1`.
* `AlgHom.map_zero_one_eq_zero`: such a `φ` kills the second coordinate unit.
* `AlgHom.map_eq_map_fst`: such a `φ` ignores its second argument.
* `AlgHom.prodFirst_comp_fst`: the coordinate map is a factorisation -- precomposing with the first
  projection returns `φ`.
* `AlgHom.prodFirst_surjective`: it inherits surjectivity from `φ`.

/-- The coordinate map `a ↦ φ (a, 0)` attached to an algebra map out of a product, packaged as an
algebra map once the image of `(1, 0)` is known to be the unit. It is multiplicative and linear for
every `φ`; unitality is exactly the hypothesis.

Note that `a ↦ (a, 0)` is not itself an algebra map -- it does not preserve `1` -- so this cannot
be obtained by composing `φ` with an inclusion. -/
