# Composition and `OrderMonoidIso.withZero`

Mathlib's `OrderMonoidIso.withZero` identifies order isomorphisms of two ordered groups with order
isomorphisms of those groups with a zero adjoined. This file records that its inverse is
compatible with composition, the analogue of `Equiv.optionCongr_trans`.

## Main results

* `OrderMonoidIso.withZero_symm_trans`: the inverse of `OrderMonoidIso.withZero` sends a composite
  to the composite of the images.
