# Finite-dimensional modules over a self-injective algebra form a Frobenius category

Let `A` be a finite-dimensional algebra over a field `k` which is self-injective on both sides:
its regular left module and its regular right module are injective. This file proves that the
canonical exact structure on the abelian category `FGModuleCat A` of finitely generated (that is,
finite-dimensional) `A`-modules is a Frobenius exact structure. Its projective-injective objects
are therefore exactly the projective objects, and its `ProjectiveStableCategory` is the stable
module category of finite-dimensional `A`-modules.

The three ingredients are:

* enough projectives, which holds over every ring (`FGModuleCat.enoughProjectives`);
* enough injectives: by right self-injectivity every finitely generated module embeds into a
  finite free module (`Module.Finite.exists_injective_linearMap_pi`), and by left
  self-injectivity finite free modules are injective;
* projective objects are injective (`FGModuleCat.injective_of_projective_of_moduleInjective_self`,
  from left self-injectivity), and an injective object is a retract of the finite free module it
  embeds into, hence projective.

Modules are left modules here. Right `A`-modules are the left `Aᵐᵒᵖ`-modules, so the statements
for them are the instances of these at the algebra `Aᵐᵒᵖ`, which is again finite-dimensional and
self-injective on both sides.

The Noetherian hypothesis `IsNoetherianRing A` is what equips `FGModuleCat A` with its abelian
structure. It is automatic for a finite-dimensional algebra (`isNoetherian_of_tower`), but it is
not an instance, since `k` cannot be inferred from `A`.

## Main results

* `FGModuleCat.enoughInjectives_of_moduleInjective_self`: over a finite-dimensional algebra
  which is self-injective on both sides, `FGModuleCat A` has enough injectives.
* `FGModuleCat.projective_of_injective_of_moduleInjective_op`: over a finite-dimensional right
  self-injective algebra, every injective object of `FGModuleCat A` is projective.
* `FGModuleCat.projective_iff_injective_of_moduleInjective_self`: over a finite-dimensional
  algebra which is self-injective on both sides, the projective and the injective objects of
  `FGModuleCat A` coincide.
* `FGModuleCat.abelian_isFrobenius`: the module-category Frobenius theorem; the canonical exact
  structure on `FGModuleCat A` is Frobenius.
