# Scalar-multiple polynomial evaluation in an opposite monoid

`Polynomial.smeval` evaluates a polynomial at an element of an additive commutative monoid with
natural number powers and an action of the coefficient semiring. All three of those structures
are inherited by the opposite monoid, and `MulOpposite.unop` respects each of them, so evaluation
commutes with `MulOpposite.unop`.

This is what transports a statement proved through an antihomomorphism -- a homomorphism to the
opposite ring -- back to the ring itself, in the situation where only powers of a single element
occur and multiplication is therefore never actually reversed. The antipode of a universal
enveloping algebra applied to a generalized binomial coefficient is such a situation, since
`Ring.choose` is a rational multiple of the value of `descPochhammer` at one element.

## Main results

* `Polynomial.unop_smeval`: `MulOpposite.unop` commutes with `Polynomial.smeval`.
