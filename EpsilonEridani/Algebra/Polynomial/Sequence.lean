# Linear independence of polynomial sequences

This file generalizes Mathlib's `Polynomial.Sequence.linearIndependent` from domains to additive
cancellation semirings where the sequence elements have right-regular leading coefficients, and
constructs a basis over rings when those coefficients are units.

## Main statements

* `Polynomial.Sequence.linearIndependent_of_isRightRegular_leadingCoeff`: a polynomial sequence
  whose elements have right-regular leading coefficients is linearly independent over any additive
  cancellation semiring.
* `Polynomial.Sequence.basisOfIsUnitLeadingCoeff`: the corresponding basis of `R[X]`.
