# The Brauer group of a field is a commutative group

Two finite-dimensional central simple `K`-algebras are **Brauer equivalent** when they become
isomorphic after passing to matrix algebras over them (Mathlib's `IsBrauerEquivalent`), and
`BrauerGroup K` is the quotient of `CSA K` by that relation. Mathlib defines that quotient and
records making it a group as a TODO; `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/BrauerGroup/Basic.lean` supplies the
constructors, the two moves that leave a Brauer class unchanged, and the behaviour of `⊗[K]` under
them, and `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/BrauerGroup/Trivial.lean` supplies the class that will be the identity.
This file assembles those pieces into the group.

The multiplication is induced by the tensor product: it is well defined on classes because
`EpsilonEridani.isBrauerEquivalent_tensorProduct_congr` says `⊗[K]` respects Brauer equivalence, and
associative, commutative and unital because
`EpsilonEridani.isBrauerEquivalent_tensorProduct_assoc`, `EpsilonEridani.isBrauerEquivalent_tensorProduct_comm`
and `EpsilonEridani.isBrauerEquivalent_tensorProduct_base` say so already at the level of algebras -- in
each case up to an actual isomorphism, which is a Brauer equivalence. The one law that is not
inherited from an isomorphism of algebras is the existence of inverses: the inverse of the class of
`A` is the class of the opposite algebra `Aᵐᵒᵖ`, and the reason `A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ` is trivial is the
Azumaya isomorphism `A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ ≃ₐ[K] M_{finrank K A}(K)` behind
`EpsilonEridani.isBrauerTrivial_tensorOp`. The new ingredient this file has to supply for that is that
`Aᵐᵒᵖ` is a move on classes at all, `EpsilonEridani.isBrauerEquivalent_op_congr`.

## The universe

The group structure is stated for `BrauerGroup.{u, u} K`, the classes of central simple algebras
living in the same universe as `K`. This is not incidental: the identity of the group is the class
of `K` itself, so the identity is available exactly when the algebras are allowed to live in the
universe of `K`. The universe-polymorphic statements about `BrauerGroup.{u, v} K` that do not
mention the identity -- for instance the two `Subsingleton` results of
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/BrauerGroup/Trivial.lean` -- are unaffected, and `EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.mk` itself is
stated in the universe-polymorphic form.

## Main definitions and results

* `EpsilonEridani.CSA.op`: the opposite of a central simple algebra, again a central simple algebra.
* `EpsilonEridani.isBrauerEquivalent_op_congr`: passing to the opposite algebra respects Brauer
  equivalence, so it descends to the classes.
* `EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.mk`: the Brauer class of a central simple algebra, with
  `EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.inductionOn` its elimination principle.
* `EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.instCommGroup`: **the Brauer group of a field is a commutative group**, with
  multiplication induced by `⊗[K]`, identity the class of `K`, and the class of `Aᵐᵒᵖ` inverse to
  the class of `A`.
* `EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.mk_eq_one_iff`: a class is the identity exactly when its algebras are
  Brauer trivial; with `EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.mk_eq_one_of_isSplittingField` and
  `EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.mk_end` as the two standard sources of identity classes.
* `EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.orderOf_mk_dvd_two`: an algebra Brauer equivalent to its own opposite has a
  class of order dividing `2`, with `EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.orderOf_mk_eq_two` the sharp form for a
  class that is not the identity. The real quaternions are the worked example in
  `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/BrauerGroup/Quaternion.lean`.

## What is not proved here

The converse of `EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.mk_eq_one_of_isSplittingField` -- that an algebra whose class
is the identity is split by `K` -- needs the uniqueness of the Wedderburn data, which sits above
this file in the import order; it is `EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.mk_eq_one_iff_isSplittingField`, in
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/BrauerGroup/Splitting.lean`. It is also what supplies, in an example such as
`ℍ[ℝ]`, the nonidentity hypothesis that `EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.orderOf_mk_eq_two` needs to sharpen
the divisibility `orderOf (mk (CSA.of ℝ ℍ[ℝ])) ∣ 2` to the equality `= 2`. The functoriality of
`BrauerGroup` under base change is not taken here either, but it is on record one file up:
`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.baseChange` in `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/BrauerGroup/BaseChange.lean`, whose kernel is
described there as the classes that become Brauer trivial over the extension
(`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.mk_mem_ker_baseChange_iff`). The converse above, one field up, is assembled in
`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.mk_mem_ker_baseChange_iff_isSplittingField`, which identifies that kernel with
the classes *split* by the extension.

/-! ### The opposite algebra as a move on Brauer classes -/

/-- The opposite of a finite-dimensional central simple `K`-algebra, again a finite-dimensional
central simple `K`-algebra: centrality and simplicity are both stable under `ᵐᵒᵖ` (instances in
Mathlib's `Algebra/Central/Basic.lean` and `RingTheory/SimpleRing/Basic.lean`), and so is the
dimension.

This is the constructor for the inverse of the group law on `BrauerGroup K`
(`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.mk_op`); the reason it *is* an inverse is
`EpsilonEridani.isBrauerTrivial_tensorOp`. -/
abbrev CSA.op (A : CSA.{u, v} K) : CSA.{u, v} K := CSA.of K (A : Type v)ᵐᵒᵖ

/-- **Passing to the opposite algebra respects Brauer equivalence**, so it descends to a map of
Brauer classes.

The witness is the one of the hypothesis, in the same two sizes: transposition identifies
`Mₙ(Aᵐᵒᵖ)` with `Mₙ(A)ᵐᵒᵖ` (Mathlib's `AlgEquiv.mopMatrix`), and an isomorphism
`Mₙ(A) ≃ₐ[K] Mₘ(B)` opposes to `Mₙ(A)ᵐᵒᵖ ≃ₐ[K] Mₘ(B)ᵐᵒᵖ`. -/

/-! ### Brauer classes -/

/-- The **Brauer class** of a finite-dimensional central simple `K`-algebra.

Mathlib's `BrauerGroup K` is the quotient of `CSA K` by `Brauer.CSA_Setoid K`, which is a `def` and
not an instance, so the quotient notation `⟦A⟧` is unavailable; this is the name for the projection
that the lemmas below are stated in terms of. -/

/-! ### The group structure -/

/-- **The Brauer group of a field is a commutative group.**

Multiplication is induced by the tensor product over `K`, which respects Brauer equivalence
(`EpsilonEridani.isBrauerEquivalent_tensorProduct_congr`); the identity is the class of `K` itself; and the
inverse of the class of `A` is the class of `Aᵐᵒᵖ`, which respects Brauer equivalence by
`EpsilonEridani.isBrauerEquivalent_op_congr` and is an inverse by `EpsilonEridani.isBrauerTrivial_tensorOp`.
Associativity, commutativity and the unit law hold already for the algebras, up to isomorphism.

The universe is pinned at `BrauerGroup.{u, u} K` because the identity is the class of `K`, which
lives in `Type u`; see the module docstring. -/

/-- **A class is the identity exactly when its algebras are Brauer trivial.**

identity class is the class of the split algebras, and every recognition of an identity class below
goes through it. -/

class. See the module docstring. -/

/-- **The endomorphism algebra of a nonzero finite-dimensional vector space has identity Brauer

/-- **An algebra isomorphic to its own opposite has a self-inverse Brauer class.**

This is the Brauer-group reading of an isomorphism `A ≃ₐ[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ`: since the class of `Aᵐᵒᵖ` is the
inverse class, such an isomorphism says the class of `A` is its own inverse, equivalently that
`A ⊗[K] A` is Brauer trivial. -/

/-- **An algebra Brauer equivalent to its own opposite has a class of order dividing `2`.**

The order is exactly `2` unless the class is the identity, that is, unless `A` is Brauer trivial
(`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.orderOf_mk_eq_two`); ruling that out is a separate matter, discussed in the
