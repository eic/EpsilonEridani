# Base change is a homomorphism of Brauer groups

Let `L / K` be an extension of fields. Scalar extension sends a finite-dimensional central simple
`K`-algebra `A` to the finite-dimensional central simple `L`-algebra `L ⊗[K] A`
(`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/CentralSimple/BaseChange.lean`), and this file shows that the assignment descends
to a group homomorphism

`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.baseChange K L : BrauerGroup K →* BrauerGroup L`.

Three things have to be checked, and each is an isomorphism of algebras that is already on record.
Well-definedness on classes is `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.matrixCoeffBaseChangeAlgEquiv`, base change
commuting with forming a matrix algebra: it turns a witness `Mₙ(A) ≃ₐ[K] Mₘ(B)` of a Brauer
equivalence into a witness `Mₙ(L ⊗[K] A) ≃ₐ[L] Mₘ(L ⊗[K] B)` in the same two sizes.
Multiplicativity is `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.TensorProduct.baseChangeTensorAlgEquiv`, distributivity of
scalar extension over `⊗`. That the identity goes to the identity is
`Algebra.TensorProduct.rid`, `L ⊗[K] K ≃ₐ[L] L`.

Two compatibilities come with it, and both are equalities of homomorphisms rather than merely
isomorphisms: base change along `K = K` is the identity homomorphism
(`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.baseChange_self`), and base change composes along a tower `K → L → M`
(`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.baseChange_comp`), the latter by
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.TensorProduct.baseChangeTowerAlgEquiv`. They are the identity and composition laws
for scalar extension along the `Algebra` instances in scope; no bundled functor on a category of
fields, and no homomorphism induced by an arbitrary map of fields, is constructed here.

## The kernel

A class dies under `baseChange K L` exactly when its algebras become Brauer trivial over `L`
(`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.mk_mem_ker_baseChange_iff`). The Wedderburn-uniqueness consequence
`EpsilonEridani.isBrauerTrivial_iff_isSplittingField` upgrades this to the promised description: a class
lies in the kernel exactly when `L` **splits** any algebra representing it, meaning that
`L ⊗[K] A` is a full matrix algebra over `L`. This is
`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.mk_mem_ker_baseChange_iff_isSplittingField`.

What is available unconditionally is the extreme case: over an algebraically closed `L` the whole
of `BrauerGroup L` is trivial, so `baseChange K L` is the trivial homomorphism
(`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.baseChange_eq_one_of_isAlgClosed`) and every class of `BrauerGroup K` is
killed by some extension.

section ScalarExtension

variable {K : Type u} [Field K] (L : Type w) [Field L] [Algebra K L]

/-- **The scalar extension of a central simple algebra**, bundled as a term of `CSA L`.

That `L ⊗[K] A` really is a finite-dimensional central simple `L`-algebra is
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/CentralSimple/BaseChange.lean`: centrality is
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.IsCentral.baseChange` and simplicity is
`EpsilonEridani.IsSimpleRing.tensorProduct_of_isCentral_right` with `L` as the simple factor, both
instances, so there is no glue here.

The three universes are independent: the base field, the algebra and the extension field are
unrelated, and the scalar extension lands in `Type (max w v)` because that is where `L ⊗[K] A`
lives. It is `EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.baseChange` that has to pin them together, because the identity
of `BrauerGroup K` is the class of `K` itself. -/
abbrev CSA.baseChange (A : CSA.{u, v} K) : CSA.{w, max w v} L := CSA.of L (L ⊗[K] A)

/-- **Base change respects Brauer equivalence**, so it descends to a map of Brauer classes.

The witness is the one of the hypothesis, in the same two sizes: base change commutes with forming
a matrix algebra (`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.matrixCoeffBaseChangeAlgEquiv`), so extending
`Mₙ(A) ≃ₐ[K] Mₘ(B)` to `L` and moving the matrices outside gives
`Mₙ(L ⊗[K] A) ≃ₐ[L] Mₘ(L ⊗[K] B)`. -/

/-! ### The homomorphism -/

/-- **Base change of Brauer classes**: the group homomorphism
`BrauerGroup K →* BrauerGroup L` induced by `A ↦ L ⊗[K] A`.

It is well defined by `EpsilonEridani.isBrauerEquivalent_baseChange_congr`, multiplicative by
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.TensorProduct.baseChangeTensorAlgEquiv`, and unital by
`Algebra.TensorProduct.rid`.

The `Quotient.liftOn` is an implementation detail, kept unexposed: the interface is
`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.baseChange_mk`, and every statement below is phrased and proved through
that. -/
def baseChange : BrauerGroup.{u, u} K →* BrauerGroup.{u, u} L where
  toFun x := Quotient.liftOn x (fun A ↦ mk (CSA.baseChange L A))
    fun _ _ h ↦ Quotient.sound (isBrauerEquivalent_baseChange_congr L h)
  map_one' := mk_eq_mk_of_algEquiv (Algebra.TensorProduct.rid K L L)
  map_mul' x y := Quotient.inductionOn₂ x y fun A B ↦
    mk_eq_mk_of_algEquiv (Algebra.TensorProduct.baseChangeTensorAlgEquiv K L A B)

/-- **The class of the scalar extension is the base change of the class**: the defining property of
`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.baseChange`, and the only place the `Quotient.liftOn` above is unfolded.
Everything below is stated and proved through this lemma, so downstream code is coupled to it
rather than to the quotient implementation. -/
@[simp]
theorem baseChange_mk (A : CSA.{u, u} K) : baseChange K L (mk A) = mk (CSA.baseChange L A) :=
  -- The parentheses around `rfl` are load-bearing: the bare `theorem ... := rfl` form is elaborated
  -- by the dedicated `rfl` elaborator, which refuses to unfold a definition of the current module
  -- that is not exposed. Wrapping it defers to ordinary term elaboration, which sees the body, so
  -- `baseChange` needs no `@[expose]`.
  (rfl)

/-! ### Functoriality -/

/-- **Base change along the identity is the identity**: `K ⊗[K] A ≃ₐ[K] A`. -/
@[simp]
theorem baseChange_self : baseChange K K = MonoidHom.id (BrauerGroup.{u, u} K) := by

  induction x using BrauerGroup.inductionOn with
  | h A => exact mk_eq_mk_of_algEquiv (Algebra.TensorProduct.lid K A)

variable (M : Type u) [Field M] [Algebra K M] [Algebra L M] [IsScalarTower K L M]

/-- **Base change composes along a tower** `K → L → M`, by
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.TensorProduct.baseChangeTowerAlgEquiv`: extending to `L` and then to `M` is
extending to `M` in one step. With `EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.baseChange_self` this is the composition
law a functor from fields to abelian groups would need; the functor itself, with its action on an
arbitrary map of fields, is not constructed here. -/
@[simp]
theorem baseChange_comp : (baseChange L M).comp (baseChange K L) = baseChange K M := by
  ext x
  induction x using BrauerGroup.inductionOn with
  | h A => exact mk_eq_mk_of_algEquiv (Algebra.TensorProduct.baseChangeTowerAlgEquiv K L A M)

/-! ### The kernel -/

/-- **A class lies in the kernel of base change to `L` exactly when its algebras become Brauer
trivial over `L`.** -/
theorem mk_mem_ker_baseChange_iff (A : CSA.{u, u} K) :
    mk A ∈ (baseChange K L).ker ↔ IsBrauerTrivial (CSA.baseChange L A) :=
  MonoidHom.mem_ker.trans mk_eq_one_iff

variable {A : Type u} [Ring A] [Algebra K A] [Algebra.IsCentral K A] [IsSimpleRing A]
  [FiniteDimensional K A]

/-- **The kernel of Brauer-group base change consists exactly of the classes split by the
extension field.**

The forward implication is the substantive one: membership says that the scalar extension
`L ⊗[K] A` is Brauer trivial, and Wedderburn uniqueness identifies Brauer triviality with being a
matrix algebra over `L`. -/
theorem mk_mem_ker_baseChange_iff_isSplittingField :
    mk (CSA.of K A) ∈ (baseChange K L).ker ↔ Algebra.IsSplittingField K A L := by
  rw [mk_mem_ker_baseChange_iff, isBrauerTrivial_iff_isSplittingField,
    Algebra.isSplittingField_baseChange_self_iff]

/-- **Every Brauer class dies over an algebraically closed extension**, so base change to one is
the trivial homomorphism: an algebraically closed field has trivial Brauer group
(`EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_brauerGroup_of_isAlgClosed`), and there is nowhere else for a class to
go. -/
theorem baseChange_eq_one_of_isAlgClosed [IsAlgClosed L] : baseChange K L = 1 := by
  have := subsingleton_brauerGroup_of_isAlgClosed.{u, u} (K := L)
