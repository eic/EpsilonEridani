# The Brauer class of the real quaternions has order two

This file applies the general Brauer-group API to the real quaternions. Quaternion conjugation
identifies `ℍ[ℝ]` with its opposite algebra, so its Brauer class is self-inverse; and `ℍ[ℝ]` is a
central division algebra of dimension `4`, so that class is not the identity
(`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.mk_eq_one_iff_finrank_eq_one`). Together these say the class has order exactly
`2`, and in particular `BrauerGroup ℝ` is not trivial. Complexification kills the class, in the two
ways `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/BrauerGroup/BaseChange.lean` offers, so the kernel of base change to `ℂ` is
strictly larger than the trivial subgroup.

That `[ℍ[ℝ]]` **generates** `BrauerGroup ℝ`, that is, that `BrauerGroup ℝ ≃ ℤ/2`, needs the
classification of the finite-dimensional real division algebras with centre `ℝ` -- only `ℝ` and
`ℍ[ℝ]` occur -- and is proved in `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/BrauerGroup/Real.lean`
(`EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.brauerGroupMulEquiv`) on top of the order computation here.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.mk_ne_one`: the Brauer class of `ℍ[ℝ]` is not the identity.
* `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.orderOf_mk_eq_two`: **that class has order exactly `2`**, so `BrauerGroup ℝ`
  contains a copy of `ℤ/2`; `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.nontrivial_brauerGroup` is the qualitative form.

/-- **The Brauer class of the real quaternions is not the identity.** `ℍ[ℝ]` is a central division
algebra over `ℝ` of dimension `4`, and a central division algebra has the identity class only when
it is one-dimensional, that is, only when it is the base field. -/
theorem mk_ne_one : BrauerGroup.mk (CSA.of ℝ ℍ[ℝ]) ≠ 1 := fun h ↦ by
  have h4 := (BrauerGroup.mk_eq_one_iff_finrank_eq_one ℝ ℍ[ℝ]).1 h
  rw [_root_.Quaternion.finrank_eq_four] at h4

/-- **The Brauer class of the real quaternions has order exactly `2`.**

Quaternion conjugation is an `ℝ`-algebra isomorphism `ℍ[ℝ] ≃ₐ[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ]ᵐᵒᵖ` (Mathlib's
`Quaternion.starAe`), so the class is its own inverse and its order divides `2`; concretely that
self-inverseness is the isomorphism `ℍ[ℝ] ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ] ≃ₐ[ℝ] M₄(ℝ)` of
`EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.tensorSelfAlgEquivMatrix`. It is not order `1` because the class is not the
identity (`EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.mk_ne_one`). -/
theorem orderOf_mk_eq_two : orderOf (BrauerGroup.mk (CSA.of ℝ ℍ[ℝ])) = 2 :=

/-- **The Brauer group of the reals is not trivial**, witnessed by the class of `ℍ[ℝ]`. Contrast
`EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_brauerGroup_of_isAlgClosed` and
`EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_brauerGroup_of_finite`: over `ℝ` there is a central division algebra other
than the base field, so the Brauer group has something in it.

The universes are pinned because `BrauerGroup.{u, v}` carries its group structure, hence its
identity element, only for `v = u`. -/

section Examples

/-- Hamilton's quaternions have nontrivial Brauer class over `ℝ`. -/
example : BrauerGroup.quaternionClass (-1 : ℝˣ) (-1) ≠ 1 := by
  simpa [BrauerGroup.quaternionClass_def] using Quaternion.mk_ne_one

/-- **The Brauer class of the real quaternions is its own inverse.** Quaternion conjugation is an
`ℝ`-algebra isomorphism `ℍ[ℝ] ≃ₐ[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ]ᵐᵒᵖ` (Mathlib's `Quaternion.starAe`), so this is
`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.inv_mk_eq_mk_of_algEquiv_op`; concretely it is the isomorphism
`ℍ[ℝ] ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ] ≃ₐ[ℝ] M₄(ℝ)` of `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.tensorSelfAlgEquivMatrix`. -/
example : (BrauerGroup.mk (CSA.of ℝ ℍ[ℝ]))⁻¹ = BrauerGroup.mk (CSA.of ℝ ℍ[ℝ]) :=
  BrauerGroup.inv_mk_eq_mk_of_algEquiv_op _root_.Quaternion.starAe

/-- **Complexification kills the Brauer class of the real quaternions**, because `ℂ` is
algebraically closed and so has trivial Brauer group.

By `EpsilonEridani.Quaternion.mk_ne_one` this is a *nontrivial* class being killed, so the kernel of
`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.baseChange ℝ ℂ` is strictly larger than the trivial subgroup: `ℍ[ℝ]` is not
already split over `ℝ`. -/
example : BrauerGroup.baseChange ℝ ℂ (BrauerGroup.mk (CSA.of ℝ ℍ[ℝ])) = 1 := by
  rw [BrauerGroup.baseChange_eq_one_of_isAlgClosed, MonoidHom.one_apply]

/-- The same class, killed through the splitting field rather than through the triviality of
`BrauerGroup ℂ`: `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.isSplittingField_of_isSepClosed` says `ℂ` splits every
finite-dimensional central simple `ℝ`-algebra, and a split algebra lies in the kernel. -/
example : BrauerGroup.mk (CSA.of ℝ ℍ[ℝ]) ∈ (BrauerGroup.baseChange ℝ ℂ).ker :=
  (BrauerGroup.mk_mem_ker_baseChange_iff_isSplittingField ℝ ℂ).2
    (Algebra.isSplittingField_of_isSepClosed ℝ ℍ[ℝ] ℂ)

/-- `ℝ` does not split `ℍ[ℝ]`: the class of `ℍ[ℝ]` is not the identity, and by
`EpsilonEridani.BrauerGroup.mk_eq_one_iff_isSplittingField` those two statements are the same one. -/
example : ¬ Algebra.IsSplittingField ℝ ℍ[ℝ] ℝ := fun h ↦
  Quaternion.mk_ne_one ((BrauerGroup.mk_eq_one_iff_isSplittingField ℝ ℍ[ℝ]).2 h)
