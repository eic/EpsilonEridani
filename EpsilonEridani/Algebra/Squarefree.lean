# Squarefree elements, squares, and squarefree parts

This file records a few general facts about squarefree elements, squares, and rational squares
that Mathlib does not provide directly, used across the multiquadratic development.

* `Squarefree.not_isSquare`: a squarefree non-unit of a monoid is not a square (the converse of
  Mathlib's `IsUnit.squarefree`). It is phrased with `Squarefree` dot-notation, so a caller
  holding `ha : Squarefree a` and `hu : ¬ IsUnit a` can write `ha.not_isSquare hu`.
* `Squarefree.neg`: negation preserves squarefreeness in any ring with distributive negation.
* `not_isSquare_intCast_of_squarefree_of_ne_one`: a squarefree integer other than `1` is not a
  rational square.
* `isSquare_mul_sq_iff`: in a commutative group with zero, multiplying by a nonzero square does
  not change squareness — the statement that squareness depends only on the square class.
* `Int.exists_squarefree_mul_sq` and `Rat.exists_squarefree_int_mul_sq`: the **squarefree part**.
  Every nonzero integer, and every nonzero rational, is a squarefree *integer* times a nonzero
  square. Mathlib's `exists_sq_mul_squarefree` proves the underlying factorization in a unique
  factorization monoid; the integer statement here records a nonzero square factor and puts the
  factors in the orientation used by the rational square-class argument.
* `Nat.four_dvd_or_exists_odd_prime_and_dvd_of_squarefree`: squarefreeness of *every* prime
  divisor of an `n > 2`, read in any ring, yields the single branch that Mathlib's
  `Nat.four_dvd_or_exists_odd_prime_and_dvd_of_two_lt` splits into. This is the bridge from a
  uniform hypothesis, which a caller can usually establish without knowing `n`, to the sharp
  branch-dependent one that a proof consumes.

/-- **The squarefree part of an integer.** Every nonzero integer is a squarefree integer times the
square of a nonzero integer. This specializes Mathlib's unique-factorization-monoid theorem
`exists_sq_mul_squarefree` to `ℤ`, makes the square factor's nonzeroness explicit, and reverses
the factor order to the form used below. -/

/-- **The squarefree part of a rational number.** Every nonzero rational is a squarefree *integer*
times the square of a nonzero rational: its square class is represented by a squarefree integer.
This is what lets a square-class argument over `ℚ` work with squarefree integer radicands. -/

/-- **From uniform squarefreeness to the sharp branch.** If every prime dividing `n > 2` is
squarefree in `R`, then either `4 ∣ n` and `2` is squarefree there, or some *odd* prime divides
`n` and is squarefree there.

Mathlib's `Nat.four_dvd_or_exists_odd_prime_and_dvd_of_two_lt` supplies the dichotomy on `n`; what
this adds is carrying the squarefreeness through it. The point of stating it is that the two
hypotheses differ in usability: the uniform one can be established with no knowledge of `n` — over
`ℤ` it is free, since every rational prime is squarefree — while the branch-dependent one is what a
proof consumes. Anything proved from the sharp form is therefore available from the uniform form
through this lemma.

The ambient ring may be noncommutative. `Squarefree` is a `Monoid` notion and the integer casts
need `AddGroupWithOne`; `Ring` is the bundled class supplying both with a single `1`, which is
the unit `IsUnit` refers to inside `Squarefree`. -/
