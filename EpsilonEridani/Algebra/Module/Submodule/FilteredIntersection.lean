# An Artinian submodule meets a filtered intersection at a finite stage

Let `F` be a downward-directed family of submodules of a module `M` — a filtration `F 0 ≥ F 1 ≥ ⋯`
is the typical case — and let `W` be a submodule of `M` that is Artinian, for instance a
finite-dimensional subspace of an infinite-dimensional vector space. The traces `W ⊓ F i` are again
downward directed, and they live in the Artinian lattice of submodules of `W`, so they cannot
descend forever: one of them already equals the trace `W ⊓ ⨅ j, F j` of the whole intersection. In
particular, if the family intersects in `⊥`, then `W ⊓ F i = ⊥` for some single `i`.

Nothing is assumed about `M` itself; that is the point. Mathlib's stabilization results for
descending chains — `IsArtinian.monotone_stabilizes` and `Module.End.eventually_iInf_range_pow_eq`
— all require the ambient module to be Artinian, which fails in the intended applications, where
`M` is an infinite-dimensional algebra and only the subspace being separated is finite-dimensional.

The lattice-theoretic core is `Directed.exists_eq_iInf` in
`EpsilonEridani/Order/Directed.lean`; everything here is its transport along `Submodule.comap W.subtype`,
which turns the traces on `W` into honest submodules of `W` and so makes `IsArtinian R W`
applicable.

## Main results

* `Submodule.exists_inf_eq_inf_iInf_of_directed`: the trace of a downward-directed family of
  submodules on an Artinian submodule `W` attains the trace of the infimum, with no hypothesis on
  the ambient module.
* `Submodule.exists_disjoint_of_directed`: consequently `W` is disjoint from a single member of the
  family as soon as it is disjoint from their infimum.
* `Submodule.exists_forall_inf_eq_inf_iInf_of_antitone` and
  `Submodule.exists_forall_inf_eq_bot_of_antitone`: for an antitone filtration indexed by a
  directed order the trace is *eventually* constant, not merely constant at one index.
* `LinearMap.exists_mkQ_comp_injective_of_directed`: the form the applications use — an embedding
  of an Artinian module into `M` stays injective after passing to the quotient by a single member
  of a family whose infimum is `⊥`.
* `Ideal.exists_forall_inf_restrictScalars_pow_eq_bot`: the specialization to the powers of a
  (one- or two-sided) ideal of an algebra, viewed as submodules over the base ring.

/-- **The trace of a downward-directed family of submodules on an Artinian submodule attains the
trace of the infimum.**

The ambient module `M` is arbitrary; only `W` is Artinian. This is the statement wanted when `M` is
an infinite-dimensional algebra and `W` is a finite-dimensional subspace of it, where applying
`Directed.exists_eq_iInf` to the lattice `Submodule R M` itself is not possible. -/

/-- **The trace of an antitone filtration on an Artinian submodule is eventually the trace of the
intersection.**

Unlike `Submodule.exists_inf_eq_inf_iInf_of_directed`, which produces one index, monotonicity makes
the conclusion hold from that index onwards. -/

/-- **An antitone filtration with zero intersection eventually misses an Artinian submodule.**

This is the separation step in the form its consumers use: `W` is a finite-dimensional subspace,
`F` is a filtration of the ambient module by submodules with `⨅ k, F k = ⊥`, and the conclusion
exhibits a stage at which `W` is separated. -/

/-- **An embedding of an Artinian module survives the quotient by a single member of a family whose

Applied to the canonical embedding of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra into its universal
enveloping algebra, this is the statement that the algebra is separated by one finite stage of a
filtration, which is how a faithful representation on a quotient is obtained. -/

/-- **The powers of an ideal whose intersection is zero are eventually disjoint from an Artinian
submodule of the algebra.**

No commutativity of `A` and no two-sidedness of `I` is needed: the powers of a left ideal are
antitone, and the statement concerns their underlying `R`-submodules. This is the shape taken by
the separation of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra from the powers of the central ideal of its
universal enveloping algebra. -/
