# Essential submodules

A submodule `N` of `M` is **essential** (also called *large*) when it is indispensable for
separating points of `M`: whenever `N ⊓ K = ⊥` for a submodule `K`, already `K = ⊥`. Essential
submodules are the notion dual to the superfluous submodules of
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Module/Submodule/Superfluous.lean`, and a monomorphism `M ↪ Q` is an injective
envelope exactly when `Q` is injective and the image is essential in `Q`.

Mathlib has neither this predicate nor injective envelopes. This file supplies the predicate with
its lattice API and identifies it, on the modules where the comparison is available, with
containing every simple submodule.

The duality with superfluity is not formal — there is no order isomorphism between the submodule
lattices of a module and of a dual object — so the statements are proved, not transported. Two of
them are genuinely less symmetric than their superfluous counterparts: the image of an essential
submodule is essential only along an embedding whose own image is essential
(`EpsilonEridani.IsEssential.map`, the analogue of `EpsilonEridani.IsSuperfluous.comap`), while the preimage is
essential along **any** linear map (`EpsilonEridani.IsEssential.comap`, the analogue of
`EpsilonEridani.IsSuperfluous.map`).

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsEssential`: `N ⊓ K = ⊥` forces `K = ⊥`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isEssential_iff`: the definition, restated so that essentiality can be proved and used
  downstream.
* `EpsilonEridani.isEssential_top`, `EpsilonEridani.IsEssential.mono`, `EpsilonEridani.isEssential_inf_iff`: the
  essential submodules of `M` are closed upwards and under binary infima, and contain `⊤`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isEssential_bot_iff`: `⊥` is essential exactly for the zero module.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsEssential.comap`: the preimage of an essential submodule under any linear map is
  essential.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsEssential.map`: the image of an essential submodule under an embedding whose range is
  itself essential is essential; `EpsilonEridani.isEssential_map_equiv_iff` records that along an
  equivalence this is an equivalence. This is what makes injective envelopes compose.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsEssential.injective_of_injective_comp` and
  `EpsilonEridani.isEssential_range_iff_forall_injective`: an embedding has essential range exactly when
  it is an *essential monomorphism*, that is, when every map out of its target whose composite with
  it is injective is itself injective. This is the minimality that makes an injective envelope an
  injective envelope.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsEssential.atom_le` and `EpsilonEridani.isEssential_iff_forall_atom_le`: an essential
  submodule contains every atom of the submodule lattice — every simple submodule — and over an
  atomic submodule lattice that property characterizes essentiality.
