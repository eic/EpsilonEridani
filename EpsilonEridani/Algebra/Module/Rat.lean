# Restricting scalars from rational to nonnegative-rational modules

Every module over `ℚ` is a module over `ℚ≥0` by restriction of scalars along
`algebraMap ℚ≥0 ℚ`. This is deliberately not a global instance: Mathlib already builds
`Module ℚ≥0 R` from `DivisionSemiring R`, so a second global path would put two structures on
types such as `ℚ` itself; they agree by `subsingleton_nnrat_module`, but not definitionally.

Consumers activate it where they need it with
`attribute [local instance] EpsilonEridani.moduleNNRat`. The typical use is to obtain Mathlib's
`BinomialRing` instance — which is stated for a `Module ℚ≥0` — on a possibly noncommutative
`ℚ`-algebra such as a universal enveloping algebra, so that `Ring.choose` elaborates there.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.moduleNNRat`: the `ℚ≥0`-module structure on a `ℚ`-module.
