# Products in a second-order linear recurrence

Fix a ring `R`, not necessarily commutative, two elements `D S : R`, and a sequence
`d : ℕ → R` obeying the
second-order recurrence

`d (r + 2) = D * d (r + 1) - S * d r`.

Two identities hold for such a sequence: the first for every one of them, the second once `d` is
normalised by `d 0 = 1` and `d 1 = D` and `D` commutes with `S`. Neither asks `d` to be a
polynomial, neither asks `R` to be commutative, and neither asks it for an order, a
characteristic, or an invertible `2`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.linearRec₂_mul_eq_succ_add_mul_pred`: for `0 < m`, multiplying a term by `D` moves it
  one step up and leaves `S` times the term one step down,
  `D * d m = d (m + 1) + S * d (m - 1)`. It needs no hypothesis on `D` and `S`, and of `R` only
  an additive group structure and a multiplication, with no ring axioms.
  This is the recurrence itself, re-indexed so that the multiplication rather than the top term
  is the subject; in that form it is what an induction on a product can apply term by term.
* `EpsilonEridani.linearRec₂_mul_eq_sum_pow_mul`: once `d` is normalised by `d 0 = 1` and `d 1 = D`,
  and `D` commutes with `S`, a product of two terms is a *sum* of single terms,
  `d r * d s = ∑ i ∈ Finset.range (r + 1), S ^ i * d (r + s - 2 * i)` for `r ≤ s`.

The second identity is the point. It is the Clebsch–Gordan shape: the product of two terms
collapses to a linear combination of single terms, with no product of `d`-values surviving on
the right. A recursion that multiplies two terms together can therefore be pushed through it and
re-read as a statement about single terms, which is what makes an induction over the two indices
terminate.

## Relation to Mathlib

Mathlib has three developments in this neighbourhood. None of them carries these identities, and
each fails to for a different reason.

* `Mathlib/Algebra/LinearRecurrence.lean` is about the *solution space* of a linear recurrence —
  `LinearRecurrence.IsSolution`, `mkSol`, `solSpace`, its `Module.Basis`, and the characteristic
  polynomial. It describes which sequences solve a recurrence; it proves no identity between the
  terms of one. The hypothesis used here is exactly `E.IsSolution d` for
  `E : LinearRecurrence R := ⟨2, ![-S, D]⟩`, but stating it that way would oblige every caller to
  build `E` and unfold a `Fin 2` sum to recover the recurrence it already has, so it is taken
  here in the unbundled form the callers actually hold.
* `Mathlib/RingTheory/Polynomial/Chebyshev.lean` fixes the coefficients. `Chebyshev.T` obeys
  `T (n + 2) = 2 * X * T (n + 1) - T n`, i.e. `D = 2 * X` and `S = 1`; its product identities
  (`T_mul_T`, `C_mul_C`) are two-term, and are identities of those specific families. An
  arbitrary `(D, S)` is not a specialisation of them.
* `Mathlib/RingTheory/Polynomial/Dickson.lean` comes closest, since `dickson k a` obeys
  `dickson k a (n + 2) = X * dickson k a (n + 1) - C a * dickson k a n`, a genuine two-parameter
  recurrence. But `D` there is pinned to the indeterminate `X`, so reaching an arbitrary `D : R`
  means passing to `R[X]` and specialising; and Mathlib proves no product formula for it in any
  case — `dickson_one_one_mul` composes at a product of *indices*, which is a different identity.

So the results below are proved directly for an arbitrary sequence, which is also the form in
which they are consumed.

## References

The consumer is the prime-power Hecke recurrence of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ModularForms`,
`T_(p^(r+2)) = T_p * T_(p^(r+1)) - p^(k-1) * ⟨p⟩ * T_(p^r)`: taking `d r = T_(p^r)`, `D = T_p` and
`S = p^(k-1) * ⟨p⟩` turns `linearRec₂_mul_eq_sum_pow_mul` into the product formula for
`T_(p^r) * T_(p^s)`. That instantiation belongs to the Hecke tree, and nothing in this file
mentions a Hecke operator.

## Provenance

Ported from AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0), the roadmap's nominated source
for `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ModularForms`, at commit `2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08`,
`projects/LeanModularForms/LeanModularForms/HeckeRIngs/GL2/Unified/Gamma0RingDn.lean`, section
`FormalChebyshev` (lines 63-109), where the two results are the `private` lemmas `formal_D_mul_d`
and `formal_ppow_mul`.

They are ported public here rather than kept private: they are the reusable content of that
block, and a private copy would have to be re-ported by every consumer. The hypotheses are
AINTLIB's, except that the first result drops the ring axioms it does not use; `D`, `S` and `d`
become `variable`s, the names follow Mathlib's
statement-describing convention instead of the source's `formal_*` working names, and the first
proof spells out the step that the source discharges with `grind`.
