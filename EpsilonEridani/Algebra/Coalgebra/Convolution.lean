# Comultiplication as a convolution product

Let `C` be an `R`-algebra carrying a comultiplication. This file records that, in the convolution
monoid of linear maps `C →ₗ[R] C ⊗[R] C`, comultiplication is the convolution product of the two
canonical inclusions `c ↦ c ⊗ₜ 1` and `c ↦ 1 ⊗ₜ c` of `C` into its tensor square.

The file also provides the exterior convolution product `LinearMap.mulTensor`: linear maps
out of modules `M` and `N`, valued in an algebra, applied legwise on `M ⊗[R] N` and
multiplied in the codomain. Its normalization rules (zero, addition, scalars) and its
multiplicativity for the convolution product make it the engine for composition-level
convolution calculations: convolution products interleave legwise, and composing with a
multiplication lands in the image of `mulTensor` for maps with a suitable multiplicativity
law. This file proves that for an **algebra map**
(`AlgHom.toConv_toLinearMap_comp_mul'`); the Leibniz-rule counterpart for counit-valued
derivations is in `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/AlgebraicGroup/Tangent/Basic.lean`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Coalgebra.comul_eq_convMul_includeLeft_includeRight`: comultiplication as the
  convolution product of the two tensor inclusions.
* `EpsilonEridani.Bialgebra.comulPoint_eq_include_mul`: the corresponding identity for the
  algebra-hom points of a commutative bialgebra.
* `EpsilonEridani.Bialgebra.toConv_comp_comulAlgHom`: the functorial form of the previous identity,
  after post-composing with an arbitrary algebra map out of the tensor square.
* `EpsilonEridani.LinearMap.mulTensor`: the exterior convolution product, with its
  normalization rules and `EpsilonEridani.LinearMap.mulTensor_convMul`.
* `EpsilonEridani.AlgHom.toConv_toLinearMap_comp_mul'`: an algebra map composed with
  multiplication is its own exterior square.

/-- **Post-composition splits the comultiplication point into its two inclusions.** For any
algebra map `φ` out of the tensor square, the point `φ ∘ Δ` is the convolution product of `φ`
restricted along the two inclusions.

The convolution monoid here is the one on points of `H` with values in the *commutative* algebra
`A`, so `H` itself need only be a semiring: the tensor square `H ⊗[R] H` is used solely as the
source of `φ`, never as a convolution target. That is why this is proved from the linear-map
identity `EpsilonEridani.Coalgebra.comul_eq_convMul_includeLeft_includeRight` rather than from
`EpsilonEridani.Bialgebra.comulPoint_eq_include_mul`, which needs `H ⊗[R] H` to be commutative. -/
