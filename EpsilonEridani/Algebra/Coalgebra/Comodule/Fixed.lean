# The fixed subcomodule

Let `C` be a coalgebra with a distinguished element `1`, and let `M` be a right `C`-comodule. The
vectors `v` with `coact v = v ⊗ 1` form a submodule, and it is a subcomodule because its own
coaction already lands in it. For the comodule attached to a representation of an affine group
this is the submodule of vectors the group fixes.

The consequences of complete reducibility for this subcomodule are proved in
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.Coalgebra.Comodule.LinearlyReductive`, which is where the notion of a
completely reducible comodule lives; they are the mechanism behind the Layer 6 comparison in the
ReductiveGroups roadmap between reductive and linearly reductive groups.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Comodule.fixedSubcomodule`: the subcomodule of vectors with coaction `v ↦ v ⊗ 1`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Comodule.mem_fixedSubcomodule` and `EpsilonEridani.Comodule.fixedSubcomodule_eq_top_iff`: its
  membership and triviality characterizations.
