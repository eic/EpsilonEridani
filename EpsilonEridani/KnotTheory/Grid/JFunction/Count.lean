# The grid `J`-function as a neighbor count

The ordered southwest count `GridPoint.I s t` and the symmetrized `J`-function are defined in
`JFunction.lean` as cardinalities of a filtered product of point sets. This file records their
fiberwise reading: `I s t` is the sum over the left points of the number of right points strictly
northeast of them, and dually over the right points. Specializing the left (or right) argument to
a singleton turns each `J`-pairing against a single grid point into a plain count of the strictly
comparable points of the other set.

The fiberwise statements are proved first for the relation-parametric `GridPoint.ICount`, so the
strict `I`-pairing here and the weak half of the marking pairing in `JFunction/Center.lean` share
the same counting API. That companion module records the resulting `JCenter` singleton formulas.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.ICount_eq_sum_card_filter`,
  `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.ICount_eq_sum_card_filter_right`: an arbitrary ordered relation count as a
  sum of fiber counts.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.JNumMixed_eq_sum_singleton_left`: an arbitrary mixed numerator as a sum of
  its singleton-left contributions.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.I_eq_sum_card_filter`, `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.I_eq_sum_card_filter_right`: the
  ordered southwest count as a sum of fiber counts over the left (resp. right) point set.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.I_singleton_left`, `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.I_singleton_right`: the ordered
  southwest count against a single grid point, as the number of strictly northeast (resp.
  southwest) points of the other set.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.JNum_singleton_left`,
  `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.JNum_singleton_left_eq_card`: the symmetrized numerator against a single
  point, as the two directed counts and as the single count of strictly comparable points.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.J_singleton_left`, `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.two_mul_J_singleton_left`: the
  `J`-pairing against a single point is half the number of strictly comparable points, so twice
  it is that integer count.
