# The grid `J`-function

This file adds the finite point-pair count used in the Maslov and Alexander gradings of grid
homology. For finite sets of grid points, `GridPoint.ICount r s t` counts the ordered pairs
`(p, q) ∈ s × t` with `r p q`; `GridPoint.I s t` is its value at the strict southwest relation,
and `GridPoint.J s t` is the symmetrized half-count. Keeping the count parametric in the
relation lets the pairing against markings at the centres of their squares
(`JFunction/Center.lean`), which weakens the comparison, share this API.

The API is deliberately point-set level: later grading definitions apply it to grid-state and
marking point sets, which the Maslov and Alexander gradings are then assembled from.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.IsSouthWest`: the strict southwest relation on grid squares.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.ICount`: the ordered count of pairs of grid points related by a given
  decidable relation.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.I`: the ordered southwest pair count, `ICount` at the strict southwest
  relation.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.JNumMixed`, `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.JMixed`: the mixed numerator with a variable
  forward relation and strict southwest reverse relation, and its rational half.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.JNum`: the numerator of the symmetrized `J`-function.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.J`: the rational-valued symmetrized `J`-function.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridState.J`: the specialized form for a pair of grid states.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.I_image_swap`, `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.J_image_swap`,
  `EpsilonEridani.GridState.J_transpose`: the southwest counts and the `J`-function are invariant
  under reflecting the point sets across the diagonal.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.I_image_rev`, `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.JNum_image_rev`,
  `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.J_image_rev`, `EpsilonEridani.GridState.J_rotate`: reversing both coordinates of
  the point sets exchanges the two arguments of the ordered count `I`, while the symmetrized
  `JNum` and `J` are invariant.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridPoint.I_graph_eq_card`, `EpsilonEridani.GridState.J_pointSet_eq_card`: graph point-set
  `J`-pairings as column-index counts.
