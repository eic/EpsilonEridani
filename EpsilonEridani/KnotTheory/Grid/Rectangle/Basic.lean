# Rectangles in grid diagrams

This file adds the first rectangle API for the grid-combinatorial lane of the Heegaard Floer
roadmap. The grid lives on a torus, so the basic one-dimensional ingredient is the circular
interval in `Fin n`. A grid rectangle carries two finite coordinate sets built from such intervals:
its `interior`, the product of two open intervals, records the grid points strictly inside and
is what a grid state must avoid for the rectangle to be empty; its `squares`, the product of
two half-open intervals, records the region the rectangle covers and is what must avoid the
`O` and `X` markings.

The final section packages an oriented rectangle from one grid state to another: two columns
where the states exchange rows, and agreement everywhere else. This is the shape counted by
the grid differential; the `IsEmptyFor` and `AvoidsMarkings` predicates record the two
finite-set disjointness conditions used for empty rectangles and marking-avoiding rectangles.

`AvoidsMarkings` tests `squares`, so a marking counts as covered exactly when its square lies
under the rectangle: marking indices are the southwest corners of square-centred markings, the
convention the Maslov and Alexander gradings use. `GridRectangle.squares_eq_coveredSquares` in
`Rectangle/Squares.lean` identifies `squares` with the grading side's name for that region.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangle`: a toroidal rectangle, represented by its four cyclic sides.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangle.symm`: the opposite toroidal rectangle with side columns reversed.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangle.transpose`: the diagonal reflection of a toroidal rectangle, exchanging
  the column and row sides.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangle.interior`: the finite set of grid points strictly inside the rectangle.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangle.squares`: the finite set of squares the rectangle covers, each named by
  its lower-left grid point.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween`: an oriented rectangle from one grid state to another.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween.symm`: the opposite oriented rectangle from `y` to `x`.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween.swapSides`: the complementary oriented rectangle from `x` to `y`
  with its two side columns exchanged.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween.transpose`: the diagonal reflection of an oriented rectangle, from
  `x.transpose` to `y.transpose`.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween.transposeEquiv`: the diagonal reflection packaged as an involutive
  equivalence with oriented rectangles from `x.transpose` to `y.transpose`.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween.all`: all oriented rectangles from `x` to `y`.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween.emptyRectangles`: the empty rectangles from `x` to `y`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangle.isEmptyFor_iff_forall_notMem_cIoo`: emptiness of a toroidal rectangle
  for a grid state, quantified over the columns strictly inside it, and
  `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween.isEmpty_iff_forall_notMem_cIoo`, its form for an oriented
  rectangle and its source state.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween.isEmpty_of_right_eq_finRotate`: a rectangle one column wide is
  empty.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangle.avoidsMarkings_iff_forall`: marking avoidance tested column by column.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween.toGridRectangle_eq`: the toroidal rectangle underlying an
  oriented rectangle, in terms of its two side columns.

## References

This supplies a prerequisite for the Tau Ceti Heegaard Floer roadmap,
`CombinatorialHeegaardFloer/README.md` in EpsilonEridaniRoadmap. Lane G.1, "Grid diagrams and grid
states", asks for rectangles and empty rectangles `Rect°(x, y)`, and Lane G.3, "The complexes
and `∂² = 0`", uses the opposite-rectangle bookkeeping in the rectangle-pairing arguments. The
encoding follows the toroidal grid-diagram convention from Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid
Homology for Knots and Links*, Chapter 3; the marking-avoidance condition defining the fully
blocked complex is in Chapter 4, Section 4.4.
