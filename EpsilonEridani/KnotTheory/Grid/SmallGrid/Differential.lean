# The grid differentials on grids of size at most two

This file records the small-grid computations for the grid differentials.

For the fully blocked differential the whole differential vanishes. An oriented rectangle needs
two distinct side columns, so grids of size at most one have no rectangles at all. On a `2 × 2`
grid, an oriented rectangle covers a single square, and the four markings of the diagram occupy
all four squares — two `O` markings and two `X` markings on the two diagonals — so every oriented
rectangle contains a marking and no rectangle is fully blocked. In either case every fully
blocked count vanishes, hence so does the whole differential.

The cases `n = 0` and `n = 1` already follow from the column-swap support bound. The new content
here is the size-two computation, which is the first sanity check for the marking-avoidance
condition defining the fully blocked grid complex: on the `2 × 2` unknot grid every square is
marked, so the fully blocked theory sees no rectangles at all.

The unblocked differential `∂⁻` need not vanish, but it does square to zero, and on these grids
the annular case of `Differential/Square/Annulus.lean` settles that on its own. At most two grid
states are available, which leaves no room for the disjoint and overlapping juxtaposition cases:
if the source and the target of a two-step term are distinct they exhaust the grid states, so
every intermediate state is one of them and its term carries a diagonal matrix coefficient, while
if the source and the target coincide the term is annular.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangles_eq_empty_of_le_two`: no rectangle is fully
  blocked in grid size at most two.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangleCount_eq_zero_of_le_two`: every fully blocked
  rectangle coefficient vanishes in grid size at most two.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferential_eq_zero_of_le_two`: the fully blocked
  differential is the zero linear map in grid size at most two.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferential_eq_zero_of_two`: the explicit `2 × 2` form.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.unblockedDifferential_comp_self_eq_zero_of_le_two`: in grid size at most
  two the unblocked differential squares to zero.

distinct side columns and two distinct side rows, so it covers exactly the one square at its
initial corner; that square holds a point of the source state, and in a column of only two
squares the two distinct markings of that column leave no unmarked square for it. -/

section Unblocked

variable (R : Type*) [CommSemiring R]

/-- On a grid of size at most two the unblocked differential squares to zero.

At most two grid states are available. If the source and the target of a two-step term are
distinct they exhaust those states, so every intermediate state coincides with the source or with
the target and its term is killed by the vanishing of the diagonal matrix coefficient. If instead
the source and the target coincide, the term returns to its source and the annular argument
applies. Unlike the general square-zero theorem
`GridDiagram.unblockedDifferential_comp_self_eq_zero`, which pairs juxtaposed rectangles and so
needs characteristic two, this small-grid instance holds over every commutative coefficient
semiring. -/
