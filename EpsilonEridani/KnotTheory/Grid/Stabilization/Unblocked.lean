# The unblocked complex of a stabilized grid

Let `G` be a grid diagram of size `n`, let `s` be a column, and let
`G' = G.stabilizeX s.castSucc (G.X s).castSucc s` be the stabilization that splits the
`X`-marking of column `s` by inserting a new column immediately before `s` and a new row
immediately below that marking. In `G'` the new `2 × 2` block is centred at the grid point
`c = (s.succ, (G.X s).succ)`: its two `X`-markings lie in the squares northwest and southeast
of `c`, the new `O`-marking in the square southwest of `c`, and the square northeast of `c` is
empty.

The grid states of `G'` split into those that contain `c`, denoted `I`, and the others, denoted
`N`. This file proves two coefficient-level facts about the unblocked differential `∂⁻` of
`G'`. They are the ingredients of the presentation of `GC⁻(G')` as the mapping cone of the
component `I → N` of `∂⁻` in `EpsilonEridani.KnotTheory.Grid.Stabilization.Cone`, with the `I` block
identified with `GC⁻(G)` over one more variable; this is the form in which Ozsváth, Stipsicz and
Szabó compare the stabilized complex with `GC⁻(G)`.

* **The `N`-to-`I` coefficient block vanishes.** A rectangle from a state outside `I` to a state
  in `I` has `c` as a corner, so it covers one of the two `X`-marked squares of the block. Hence
  `∂⁻` has no matrix coefficient from `N` to `I` (`unblockedCoefficient_stabilizeX_eq_zero`).
* **The `I` coefficient block agrees with `GC⁻(G)` over one more variable.** Every state of `I`
  is obtained from a unique state of `G` by inserting `c` (`GridState.insertPoint`), and inserting
  `c` identifies the rectangles counted by `∂⁻` between states in `I` with those counted by
  `∂⁻` on `GC⁻(G)`. The two
  `X`-markings of the block cover exactly the squares that the `X`-marking of column `s` covers
  in `G`, and a rectangle avoiding them never covers `c` or the new `O`-marking. So the matrix
  coefficients agree after renaming the variables of `G` into those of `G'`; the variable of
  the new `O`-marking never occurs (`unblockedCoefficient_stabilizeX_insertPoint`).

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.unblockedCoefficient_stabilizeX_insertPoint`: the matrix coefficients of
  `∂⁻` between states containing `c` are the renamed coefficients of `∂⁻` for `G`.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.unblockedCoefficient_stabilizeX_eq_zero`: `∂⁻` has no matrix coefficient
  from a state not containing `c` to a state containing it.

## References

These coefficient identities are part of the stabilization-invariance argument in
Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for Knots and Links*, Section 5.2, where the complex of
the stabilized diagram is identified with a mapping cone built from the complex of `G`.
