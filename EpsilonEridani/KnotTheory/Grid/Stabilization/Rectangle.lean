# Rectangles under grid-point insertion

This file transports an oriented rectangle between grid states along the insertion of a common
point into its source and target. It characterizes the sides and covered squares of the transported
rectangle, proves that transport is a bijection onto the rectangles between states containing the
inserted point, and compares emptiness before and after transport.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween.insertPoint`: an oriented rectangle between two grid states,
  transported to the states obtained by inserting one point.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween.exists_insertPoint_eq`: every rectangle between two states with
  a common inserted point is transported from the smaller grid.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween.mem_coveredSquares_insertPoint`: transport preserves
  membership of embedded squares in the covered region.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween.mem_coveredSquares_insertPoint_succ_succ`: covered-square
  membership for insertion immediately after specified coordinates is detected by collapsing
  those coordinates with `Fin.predAbove`.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween.isEmpty_insertPoint_iff`: a transported rectangle is empty
  exactly when the original one is and the inserted point is not in its interior.
