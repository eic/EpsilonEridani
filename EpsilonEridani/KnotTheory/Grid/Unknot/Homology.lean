# The fully blocked homology of the three-by-three unknot grid

In the standard unknot grid diagram the `O` markings sit on the diagonal and the `X` markings
one row above it, so the markings a rectangle covers can be read off from its columns alone. A
rectangle whose column arc is the half-open arc `[l, r)` covers the `O` markings of the rows in
`[l, r)` and the `X` markings of the rows in `[l + 1, r]`, so it avoids the markings exactly when
its row arc misses the arc `[l, r]`, which is one row longer than its column arc
(`GridRectangleBetween.avoidsMarkings_unknot_iff` states this column by column).

In grid number three this leaves no freedom at all. Both arcs must be single, the row arc must
be the one row the column arc does not forbid, and the source state is pinned down to the
*subdiagonal* state `GridState.subdiagonal 3`, whose point in each column lies one row below the
diagonal. Conversely every rectangle leaving that state through a pair of cyclically consecutive
columns is fully blocked
(`GridRectangleBetween.avoidsMarkings_unknot_one_iff`). So the fully blocked differential of the
`3 × 3` unknot grid kills all five other grid states and sends the subdiagonal state to the sum
of its three cyclically consecutive column transpositions.

This is the first grid diagram on which the fully blocked differential is nonzero: on grids of
size at most two every square is marked and no rectangle survives. The resulting homology has
`ZMod 2`-dimension `4`, against dimension `2` on the `2 × 2` unknot grid
(`GridDiagram.finrank_fullyBlockedHomology_of_two`). Those are the ranks `2 ^ (N - 1)` of the
`(N - 1)`-fold tensor power of `W = 𝔽 ⊕ 𝔽`, the stabilization factor predicted for an `N`-grid
unknot, so the dependence of the fully blocked theory on the grid number is real. The bigrading
of the homology is not computed here.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.mem_fullyBlockedRectangles_unknot_one_iff`: in grid number three a
  rectangle is fully blocked exactly when it leaves the subdiagonal state through two cyclically
  consecutive columns.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangleCount_unknot_one_eq_one_iff`: the matrix entries of
  the fully blocked differential of the `3 × 3` unknot grid.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferentialOnGenerator_unknot_one_subdiagonal`: the value of
  the differential on its unique nonzero generator.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferential_unknot_one_ne_zero`: that differential is
  nonzero.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.finrank_fullyBlockedHomology_unknot_one`: the fully blocked homology of
  the `3 × 3` unknot grid has dimension four.

## References

The diagram and the fully blocked theory follow Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for
Knots and Links*, Chapters 3 and 4; the rank `2 ^ (N - 1)` expected of the fully blocked
homology of an `N`-grid unknot is the stabilization statement of Chapter 4.6 there.
