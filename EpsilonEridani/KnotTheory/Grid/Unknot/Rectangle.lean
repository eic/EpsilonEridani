# Rectangles in the standard unknot grid

This file characterizes when a rectangle in a standard unknot grid avoids all markings. Since the
`O` markings lie on the diagonal and the `X` markings one row above it, the condition can be read
off column by column.

In grid number three the characterization leaves no freedom at all: both the column arc and the
row arc must be single, the row arc must be the one row the column arc does not forbid, and the
avoidance conditions force the source state to equal the *subdiagonal* state
`GridState.subdiagonal 3`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangle.avoidsMarkings_unknot_iff`: marking avoidance in the standard unknot
  grid of any size.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleBetween.avoidsMarkings_unknot_one_iff`: in grid number three a rectangle
  avoids the markings exactly when it leaves the subdiagonal state through two cyclically
  consecutive columns.

and Links*, Chapters 3 and 4.
