# The grid determinant formula

The alternating Alexander *state sum* of a grid diagram is

`∑_{x ∈ S(G)} (-1)^{M_O(x)} T^{2 A(x)}`,

one term for each of the `n!` grid states. For odd-component diagrams, this corresponds to the
graded Euler characteristic of the grid chain module after identifying `T` with a square root of
the usual Alexander variable; that identification is
`EpsilonEridani.OddComponentGridDiagram.gradedEulerChar_eq_stateSum` in
`Grid/EulerCharacteristic.lean`. This file evaluates the state sum in closed form: it is a sign
times a monomial times the determinant of an explicit `n × n` matrix of monomials read off the
diagram. Two facts combine to produce the determinant.

*The sign is the sign of a permutation.* A grid state is a permutation of the columns, and
`GridDiagram.negOnePow_maslovOℤ` says that `(-1)^{M_O(x)}` is that permutation's sign, up to a
factor depending only on the diagram. So the alternating sum over states is an alternating sum
over the symmetric group.

*The Alexander grading is a sum of local weights.* Twice the Alexander grading is
`2 A(x) = M_O(x) - M_X(x) - (n - 1)`, in which the two `J`-self-pairings of `x` cancel and only
the numerators of the two pairings of `x` against the markings survive. Each is a count of column
pairs, so fibring it over the column of its grid-state entry writes it as a sum over the
columns of `x` of a quantity `GridState.JNumCenterAt` depending only on the grid point occupied
there. Twice the Alexander grading is therefore `∑_c w(c, x c) + K` for the weight
`GridDiagram.alexanderTwoWeight` and a constant `GridDiagram.alexanderTwoShift`.

Together these turn the state sum into `∑_σ sgn(σ) ∏_c T^{w(c, σ c)}`, which is by definition the
determinant of `GridDiagram.weightMatrix`, the weight matrix whose `(c, r)` entry is the monomial
`T^{w(c, r)}`. That is `GridDiagram.stateSum_eq_smul_T_mul_det_weightMatrix`, the grid
determinant formula.

The grading variable `T` is a square root of the Alexander variable: the exponents are values of
`GridDiagram.alexanderTwoℤ`, which is twice the Alexander grading, because the Alexander grading
itself is only a half-integer unless the diagram presents an odd number of components. Working
with the doubled grading keeps every statement here free of that hypothesis; specialising to a
knot grid, where `2 A(x)` is even, costs nothing.

A first consequence, and a check that the formula is not vacuous: setting `T = 1` makes every
entry of the weight matrix equal to `1`, so its determinant vanishes as soon as the grid has two
columns. Hence `∑_x (-1)^{M_O(x)} = 0`, that is, on any grid of size at least two exactly half of
the states have even `O`-Maslov grading (`GridDiagram.sum_negOnePow_maslovOℤ_eq_zero`).

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.alexanderTwoWeight`, `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.alexanderTwoShift`: the local
  weight of a grid point and the constant in the decomposition of twice the Alexander grading.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.weightMatrix`: the weight matrix, with monomial entries `T^{w(c, r)}`.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.stateSum`: the alternating state sum with exponents given by twice the
  Alexander grading.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.alexanderTwoℤ_eq_sum_alexanderTwoWeight_add_shift`: twice the Alexander
  grading is a sum of local weights plus a constant.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.stateSum_eq_smul_T_mul_det_weightMatrix`: the grid determinant formula.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.sum_negOnePow_maslovOℤ_eq_zero`: the alternating sign sum over grid states
  vanishes on every grid of size at least two.

This advances `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/CombinatorialHeegaardFloer/README.md`, Lane G.4, "Euler
characteristic = Alexander polynomial, via the grid determinant formula". The determinant formula
is Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for Knots and Links*, Chapter 3.3; identifying the
determinant with the Alexander polynomial of the link the diagram presents is the remaining half
of that milestone.
