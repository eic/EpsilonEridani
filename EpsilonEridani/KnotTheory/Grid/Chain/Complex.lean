# Grid differentials as homological complexes

This file packages the three grid chain modules and their square-zero differentials as
homological complexes in Mathlib's sense. Each uses the one-object circular shape
`ComplexShape.refl Unit`: its sole object is the total chain module and its sole differential is
the corresponding grid differential. This is the ungraded complex underlying the separate
bigraded decompositions of the fully blocked and unblocked chain modules.

The one-object form retains exactly the algebra needed for cycles, boundaries, chain maps, and
homology while applying to every grid diagram. In particular it does not require the odd-component
hypothesis used to make the Alexander grading integral. Later graded constructions can refine these
complexes by restricting the differential to their homogeneous pieces. Here
`simplyBlockedComplex` denotes the algebraic specialization obtained by setting one selected
`O`-variable to zero. This has the standard simply blocked interpretation for knot grids; for a
multi-component link, that interpretation instead requires one blocked `O`-marking on each
component.

The fully blocked complex is over `ZMod 2`. The unblocked complex and the one-variable
specialization are defined over an arbitrary commutative coefficient ring of characteristic
two.
Their coefficient rings are, respectively, the polynomial ring on all columns and the polynomial
ring on the columns other than the selected blocked column.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedComplex`: the fully blocked grid complex.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.unblockedComplex`: the unblocked grid complex `GC⁻`.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.simplyBlockedComplex`: the one-variable specialization obtained by setting
  one selected `O`-variable to zero.
