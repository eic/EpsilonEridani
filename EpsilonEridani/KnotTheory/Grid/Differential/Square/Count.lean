# Counting two-rectangle decompositions

The coefficient of the square of the fully blocked grid differential is a sum over intermediate
states of products of rectangle counts. This file identifies that expression with the parity of a
single finite set: the set of pairs of composable fully blocked empty rectangles with prescribed
source and target.

This is the algebraic handoff needed by the juxtaposition proof of `∂² = 0`. Its geometric part can
now act directly on `GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDecompositions G x z`: a fixed-point-free involution
of this finite set proves that its cardinality is even, and hence that the corresponding
coefficient of the differential square vanishes.

The same shared decomposition construction also reindexes the matrix entries of the unblocked
differential square as weighted sums over pairs of empty, `X`-avoiding rectangles. This is the
counting form used by the disjoint and one-common-side cases.

*Which region carries a marking.* Every fully blocked statement below is relative to the ambient
`GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangles`, and none of them unfolds the marking condition: they relate
two objects assembled from that one finite set. The marking region is fixed upstream by
`GridRectangle.AvoidsMarkings`, which asks that no square a rectangle covers carry an `O` or an
`X` marking.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDecompositions`: composable pairs of fully blocked empty
  rectangles with fixed endpoints.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDecompositionCount`: the cardinality of this set modulo two.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.unblockedDecompositions`: composable pairs of rectangles counted by the
  unblocked differential.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.unblockedDecompositionWeight`: the product of their two monomial weights.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.mem_fullyBlockedDecompositions`: membership means that both rectangles in
  the decomposition are fully blocked.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.card_fullyBlockedDecompositions`: the cardinality is the sum, over
  intermediate states, of the product of the two rectangle-set cardinalities.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDecompositionCount_eq_sum`: the parity count is the coefficient
  sum appearing in the square of the differential.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDecompositionCount_eq_zero_iff_even`: its vanishing is exactly
  evenness of the finite decomposition set.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferential_comp_self_eq_zero_iff_decompositionCount`: the
  differential squares to zero exactly when every decomposition count vanishes.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.sum_unblockedCoefficient_mul_unblockedCoefficient`: an unblocked two-step
  matrix entry is the weighted sum over the corresponding decompositions.
