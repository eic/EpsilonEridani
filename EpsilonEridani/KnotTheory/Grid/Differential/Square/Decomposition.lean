# Two-step rectangle decompositions

A two-step term in the square of the grid differential consists of a rectangle from `x` to an
intermediate grid state and a second rectangle from that state to `z`. This file packages such a
factorization as `GridRectangleDecomposition`, the shared object on which the disjoint,
overlapping and annular cases of the square-zero argument all operate.

Such a factorization is determined by the ordered side columns of its two rectangles: the
intermediate state is the source with the first pair of columns swapped, and an oriented rectangle
between two given states is determined by its side columns.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleDecomposition`: two composable oriented grid rectangles.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleDecomposition.decompositionsOf`: composable pairs drawn from any family
  of finite rectangle sets.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleDecomposition.ext`: a decomposition is determined by the ordered side
  columns of its two rectangles.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleDecomposition.sides_injective`: the same statement as
  injectivity of the ordered quadruple of side columns.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleDecomposition.target_apply_of_notMem_sideColumns`: away from the four
  side columns the target of a decomposition agrees with its source.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleDecomposition.transpose` and `transposeEquiv`: diagonal reflection of
  both constituent rectangles gives an involutive equivalence between decompositions of the
  original and transposed endpoint states.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridRectangleDecomposition.target_mem_twoStepColumnSwapNeighbors`: the target of a
  decomposition is reached from its source by two nontrivial column transpositions.
