# Maslov and Alexander gradings for grid states

This file records the rational-valued grading formulas for the grid-combinatorial lane of the
Heegaard Floer roadmap. The point-set `J`-function of a pair of grid states and the pairing of a
grid state against a set of marked squares were developed separately; here we use them to define
the `O`- and `X`-Maslov gradings and the Alexander grading of a grid state.

The `O`-Maslov grading is
`M_O(x) = J(x, x) - 2 J_O(x) + J(𝕆, 𝕆) + 1`, and the `X`-Maslov grading is defined analogously.
The middle term compares grid points against markings, so it uses the asymmetric marking pairing
`GridDiagram.JO` or `GridDiagram.JX` from `JFunction/Center.lean`, which accounts for the markings
sitting at the centres of their squares. The two outer terms compare like with like and use the
ordinary `J`-pairing.

The definitions are intentionally formula-level. The later integer-valuedness and
rectangle-change theorems can refer to these names without unfolding the point-pair count.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.maslovO`, `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.maslovX`: the two Maslov grading
  formulas attached to the `O` and `X` markings.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.alexander`: the Alexander grading formula.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.maslovO_transpose`, `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.maslovX_transpose`,
  `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.alexander_transpose`: the Maslov and Alexander gradings are invariant
  under the diagonal reflection of a grid state and diagram.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.maslovO_swapMarkings`, `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.maslovX_swapMarkings`: the
  two Maslov gradings are exchanged by the marking swap.
* `EpsilonEridani.GridDiagram.alexander_swapMarkings`: the Alexander grading is negated up to the
  normalization shift under the marking swap.

placement convention, and Chapter 4.3 for the bigrading. In particular,
`A(x) = (M_O(x) - M_X(x)) / 2 - (n - 1) / 2`.

This is the formula `A(x) = (M_O(x) - M_X(x)) / 2 - (n - 1) / 2`. The shift is cast
through `ℤ`, so the formula remains literal at `n = 0`; integer-valuedness is a later grading
theorem. -/
