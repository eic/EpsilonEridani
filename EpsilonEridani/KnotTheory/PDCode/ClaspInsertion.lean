# Algebraic clasp insertion in PD-codes

The code-level tangle replacement underlying the second Reidemeister move creates two crossings
at which the same strand is over. On a PD-code with `n` crossings,
`EpsilonEridani.PDCode.insertClasp D p q b hqp hqe` performs this algebraic clasp insertion on two
distinct arcs: the arc `P` ending at the half-edge `p` and the arc `Q` ending at the half-edge
`q`. Both arcs are cut open and routed through the two new crossings. These are the last two,
`(Fin.last n).castSucc` (the first crossing, reached from `p` and `q`) and `Fin.last (n + 1)`
(the second crossing, reached from the other ends of the two arcs).

With the slots of a crossing in counterclockwise order, the strand along `P` occupies slots `0`
and `2` of the first crossing and slots `1` and `3` of the second, and the strand along `Q`
occupies slots `1` and `3` of the first crossing and slots `0` and `2` of the second. The arcs are:
`p` to slot `0` and `q` to slot `1` of the first crossing; slot `3` of the second crossing to the
other end of `P` and slot `2` to the other end of `Q`; and the two short arcs of the clasp, from
slot `2` of the first crossing to slot `1` of the second (along `P`) and from slot `3` of the
first crossing to slot `0` of the second (along `Q`). The Boolean `b` is the over-pair indicator
of the first crossing, and the second crossing gets `!b`, so that the same strand is over at both:
with `b = false` it is the strand along `P`.

Of the four ways to smooth the two new crossings, one smooths them back into the two original
arcs. The other three all reconnect the cut ends instead, `p` to `q` and the other end of `P` to
the other end of `Q`, and one of these three also cuts off the circle through the two short arcs
of the clasp. The first state and the circle-cutting one carry weight `1` in the Kauffman
bracket, and the other two weights `a ^ 2` and `a⁻¹ ^ 2`; since `a ^ 2 + a⁻¹ ^ 2 + δ = 0` for the
loop value `δ = -(a ^ 2 + a⁻¹ ^ 2)`, the reconnected terms cancel, so the clasp insertion leaves
the **Kauffman bracket invariant**. The insertion also keeps the number of components.

This construction does **not** by itself define a Reidemeister-II relation. `EpsilonEridani.PDCode`
contains no planar realization or face-incidence data, so its arguments cannot assert that the
two arcs lie on the boundary of a common local disk. Given such geometric locality data, the
construction is the usual second Reidemeister move when the arcs face each other with `p` and `q`
on the same side; passing `D.edgePair.val q` instead of `q` joins them the other way round. Without
that data it is only an algebraic operation on the code. It applies only to codes with a crossing;
an insertion involving a crossing-free circle is not treated here.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.PDCode.insertClasp`: algebraically insert a two-crossing clasp into two arcs.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.PDCode.crossingComponentCount_insertClasp`: the insertion keeps the number of
  components.
* `EpsilonEridani.PDCode.kauffmanBracket_insertClasp`: the insertion leaves the Kauffman bracket
  unchanged.
* `EpsilonEridani.PDCode.mirror_insertClasp`: mirroring the new code inserts the clasp with the other
  strand over into the mirror code.

/-! ### The arcs of a clasp, on the old half-edges and the slots of two new crossings

A clasp's arcs are built as an involution of `(α ⊕ Fin 4) ⊕ Fin 4`: `α` holds the old half-edges,
the middle `Fin 4` the slots of the first new crossing, and the last `Fin 4` those of the second.
With `e` the old arcs, the arcs from `p` to `e p` and from `q` to `e q` are cut and routed through
the slots. These helpers serve only the proofs in this file. -/

second, slots `2` and `3` of the first crossing to slots `1` and `0` of the second, and every
other half-edge to its old partner. -/
