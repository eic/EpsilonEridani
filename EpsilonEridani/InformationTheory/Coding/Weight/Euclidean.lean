# Euclidean weights of words over `ℤ/n`

The Euclidean weight of a residue `a` modulo `n` is the square of the distance from `a` to `0`
on the cycle `ℤ/n`, namely `min (a, n - a)²` for the representative `0 ≤ a < n`; in Mathlib's
terms it is the square of the absolute value of `ZMod.valMinAbs a`. The Euclidean weight of a
word is the sum of the Euclidean weights of its coordinates, that is, the squared Euclidean norm
of the word's least absolute integer lift.

Euclidean weights are the weights used for codes over `ℤ/2k` whose Construction A lattices are
even: the Type II condition over `ℤ/2^r` asks that all Euclidean weights be divisible by
`2^(r+1)`. Over `ℤ/2` the Euclidean weight is the Hamming weight.
