# Weight divisibility for ternary codes

The self-dot-product of a ternary word is its Hamming weight modulo three. Consequently,
every word in a Euclidean self-orthogonal ternary code has weight divisible by three.
This supplies the weight constraint for self-dual codes such as the extended ternary Golay code.
