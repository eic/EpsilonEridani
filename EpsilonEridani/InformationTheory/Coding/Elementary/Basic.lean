# Repetition and single-parity-check codes

The repetition code consists of constant words, and the single-parity-check code consists of
words whose coordinate sum is zero. They are Euclidean duals. A positive-length repetition
code has as many words as its alphabet; at length zero it has only one word.
Over a finite field with `q` elements, the parity-check code has `q^(n - 1)` words at length `n`,
including length zero, where the natural-number subtraction gives exponent zero.

Their weight enumerators are computed in
`EpsilonEridani.InformationTheory.Coding.Elementary.WeightEnumerator`.
