# Type II codes over `ℤ/2^r`

Following Dougherty, Gulliver, and Harada, a Type II code over `ℤ/2^r` is an additive code which
is self-dual for the `ℤ/2^r` dot product and all of whose Euclidean weights are divisible by
`2^(r+1)`. For `r ≥ 1`, these are exactly the codes whose Construction A lattices are even and
unimodular.

The notion is specific to moduli which are powers of two, so the predicate is stated only for
codes over `ℤ/2^r`; it is not a predicate on codes over an arbitrary `ℤ/m`. The intended range is
`r ≥ 1`: at `r = 0` every code over the trivial ring `ℤ/1` satisfies it. The evenness
characterization therefore requires `r ≠ 0`. At `r = 1` it is the binary Type II condition, since
binary Euclidean weights are Hamming weights.
