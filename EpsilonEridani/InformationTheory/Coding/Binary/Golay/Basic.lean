# The extended binary Golay code

The extended binary Golay code is the row space of the systematic matrix `[I₁₂ | B]`,
where `B` is the bordered reverse-circulant matrix over `ZMod 2`. The first twelve
coordinates recover the message. The generator is also a parity-check matrix.

This doubly-even self-dual binary code has parameters `[24, 12, 8]`. Its self-duality and
divisibility of weights by four make it an input to Construction A, which associates an even
unimodular lattice to such a code. The weight distribution and homogeneous weight enumerator
describe the numbers of codewords of each weight, and every one of the twenty-four coordinates
is met by a codeword of weight eight, an *octad*.

The matrix convention is that of Huffman and Pless, *Fundamentals of Error-Correcting
Codes*, §1.9.1 and Chapter 9.
