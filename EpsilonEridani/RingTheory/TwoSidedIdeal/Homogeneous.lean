# Two-sided ideals spanned by homogeneous elements

A relation ideal of a noncommutative graded ring is presented as `TwoSidedIdeal.span` of a set of
relators, and it is homogeneous as soon as those relators are. This file proves that, together
with the two absorption lemmas the proof runs on: if every homogeneous component of `x` lies in an
ideal, then so does every homogeneous component of `a * x` and of `x * a`.

Homogeneity itself is stated through Mathlib's `Ideal.IsHomogeneous`, applied to the underlying
one-sided ideal `TwoSidedIdeal.asIdeal`, which is where the quotient by a two-sided ideal is
formed.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.TwoSidedIdeal.homogeneous_span`: **a two-sided ideal spanned by homogeneous elements
  is homogeneous.**
* `EpsilonEridani.Ideal.proj_mul_mem_left` and `EpsilonEridani.TwoSidedIdeal.proj_mul_mem_right`: the absorption
  lemmas.

## Implementation notes

Mathlib's `Ideal.mul_homogeneous_element_mem_of_mem` supplies the one-sided half of
`EpsilonEridani.Ideal.proj_mul_mem_left`, where the *homogeneous* factor is on the right; multiplying on
the right only asks the ideal to absorb on the left, so that lemma is stated for an `Ideal` and
lives in the matching namespace. Its mirror image
`EpsilonEridani.TwoSidedIdeal.homogeneous_element_mul_mem_of_mem` is the one place two-sidedness is used,
and it is therefore stated for a `TwoSidedIdeal`.

## References

Mathlib's `Ideal.homogeneous_span` is the one-sided statement that
`EpsilonEridani.TwoSidedIdeal.homogeneous_span` extends from `Ideal.span` to `TwoSidedIdeal.span`, and the
proof of `EpsilonEridani.TwoSidedIdeal.homogeneous_element_mul_mem_of_mem` is adapted from Mathlib's proof
of `Ideal.mul_homogeneous_element_mem_of_mem`, with the two factors swapped.

The open Mathlib PR [#36501](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/36501) builds
the graded structure on the quotient of a graded ring by a homogeneous relation. That is the step
*after* the one taken here, and it is independent of it: homogeneity of the relation is an input
there, and it is what the statements below produce for a relation ideal presented by generators.
