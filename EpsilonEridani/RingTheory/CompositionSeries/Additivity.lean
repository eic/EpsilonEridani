# Additivity of the Jordan-Hölder multiplicities

The Jordan-Hölder multiplicity `[M : S]` counts the factors isomorphic to `S` in a composition
series of `M`.  This file proves that it is **additive in a short exact sequence**: for a submodule
`p` of a module `M` of finite length,

`[M : S] = [p : S] + [M ⧸ p : S]`.

Both the composition factors of `p` and those of `M ⧸ p` are composition factors of `M`, and no
others are, so a single count splits in two.

The proof glues a composition series of `p` and a composition series of `M ⧸ p` into one series of
`M`: the lower half is carried along the *injective* map `p.subtype` by
`EpsilonEridani.mapCompositionSeriesOfInjective` and the upper half along the *surjective* map `p.mkQ` by
`EpsilonEridani.comapCompositionSeriesOfSurjective`, both of
`EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/CompositionSeries/Basic.lean`; that these transports preserve every
multiplicity is `EpsilonEridani.compositionMultiplicity_mapCompositionSeriesOfInjective` and
`EpsilonEridani.compositionMultiplicity_comapCompositionSeriesOfSurjective`, of
`EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/CompositionSeries/Multiplicity.lean`.  The two resulting series meet at `p` and
are glued with `RelSeries.smash`, whose `castAdd`/`natAdd` index lemmas split the count of factors
isomorphic to `S` into the two halves.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.compositionMultiplicity_smash`: the multiplicities of two composition series glued end
  to end add.
* `EpsilonEridani.jordanHolderMultiplicity_eq_submodule_add_quotient`: **additivity**,
  `[M : S] = [p : S] + [M ⧸ p : S]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.jordanHolderMultiplicity_eq_add_of_exact`: the same statement for a short exact sequence
  `0 → A → M → B → 0`.
* `EpsilonEridani.jordanHolderMultiplicity_le_of_injective` and
  `EpsilonEridani.jordanHolderMultiplicity_le_of_surjective`: a submodule and a quotient — more generally
  the source of an injective map into `M` and the target of a surjective map out of `M` — each
  contribute at most `M`'s multiplicity.
* `EpsilonEridani.jordanHolderMultiplicity_prod`: `[M × N : S] = [M : S] + [N : S]`.

## References

This file refines Mathlib's `Module.length_eq_add_of_exact` (`Mathlib/RingTheory/Length.lean`, by
Andrew Yang) from counting the factors of a composition series to counting those isomorphic to a
fixed simple module `S`, and follows its proof plan: the same two transports along an injective and
a surjective map, the same `RelSeries.smash` gluing, and the same `map_bot`/`comap_top` endpoint
bookkeeping.  The monotonicity and product corollaries below are likewise the multiplicity
analogues of `Module.length_le_of_injective`, `Module.length_le_of_surjective` and
`Module.length_prod`.  What is new is that the transports are shown to preserve each factor's
isomorphism class and not merely the number of factors: the identification of the subquotients is
`EpsilonEridani.mapSubquotientEquivOfInjective` and `EpsilonEridani.comapSubquotientEquivOfSurjective` of
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Module/Submodule/Quotient.lean`, and the resulting factor-by-factor comparison is
`EpsilonEridani.isCompositionFactorAt_mapCompositionSeriesOfInjective_iff` and its surjective counterpart
in `EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/CompositionSeries/Multiplicity.lean`;
`EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/CompositionSeries/Basic.lean` supplies the transports themselves.

The additivity of `[Pᵢ : Sⱼ]` is what makes the Cartan matrix of a finite-dimensional algebra
computable, in Layer 3 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/QuiverRepresentations/README.md` ("The Cartan matrix of an
algebra"); `EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/CompositionSeries/Multiplicity.lean` supplies the multiplicity
itself.

/-- **Additivity in a short exact sequence** `0 → A → M → B → 0`: the multiplicity of `S` in the
middle term is the sum of its multiplicities in the two ends.

Mathematically the finiteness of `A` and of `B` follows from that of `M`, through `A ≃ₗ[R] range f`
and `M ⧸ ker g ≃ₗ[R] B`.  The assumptions are nevertheless binders here rather than facts derived
in the proof, because `jordanHolderMultiplicity R A S` and `jordanHolderMultiplicity R B S` carry
them in their own signatures: the conclusion does not elaborate without them, so a caller holds
them already in order to state it. -/
