# The integral closure of a polynomial ring in a purely inseparable extension is finite

Let `k` be a field, `P = k[X_1, …, X_r]`, `K` its fraction field and `M / K` a finite purely
inseparable extension of exponent `e`, `q = p ^ e`. The integral closure of `P` in `M` is a finite
`P`-module. This is the purely inseparable half of normalization-finiteness, the only part that
is genuinely absent from Mathlib (whose `IsIntegralClosure.finite` argues through the trace form
and needs separability), and it is Stacks, Lemma 10.161.13 (tag 032O) run once for `r` variables
over a field.

The argument. Pick a `K`-basis `m_j` of `M` inside the integral closure. Each `m_j ^ q` lies in
`K` and is integral over `P`, hence lies in `P` (`P` is a UFD). Let `k' / k` be a finite
extension containing `q`-th roots of the finitely many coefficients of the `m_j ^ q`, and let
`P' = k'[X_1, …, X_r]` be a `P`-algebra through `X_i ↦ X_i ^ q`. Then `P'` is a finite `P`-module,
integrally closed with fraction field `K'`, and `M` embeds over `K` into `K'` because the `q`-th
powers of the `m_j` become `q`-th powers there. So the integral closure of `P` in `M` maps
injectively and `P`-linearly into the integral closure of `P` in `K'`, which is `P'`, and a
submodule of a finite module over a Noetherian ring is finite.

## Main results

* `IsIntegral.exists_algebraMap_eq_iterateFrobenius`: the `q`-th power of an element
  integral over the (integrally closed) base ring lies in that ring.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsIntegralClosure.finite_of_forall_exists_pow_eq`: the abstract assembly — an
  integral closure in a purely inseparable extension is finite as soon as some overring finite
  over the base, and an integral closure of it in a larger field, absorbs the `q`-th powers of a
  generating set.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsIntegralClosure.finite_mvPolynomial_of_isPurelyInseparable`: the theorem for
  polynomial rings over a field.

## Provenance

Roadmap: EllipticCurves, the Layers 0-1 target *Function-field foundations and isogenies*
(`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:1096`), through the support module
`RingTheory/IntegralClosure/NormalizationFinite`. The mathematics is the second paragraph of the
proof of Stacks, Lemma 10.161.13 (tag 032O), with its "some details omitted" spelled out.

show that the integral closure of `R[x]` in `L′(x^{1/q})` is finite over `R[x]`. And this
integral closure is equal to `R′[x^{1/q}]` … finite over `R[x]`." The abstract assembly. Let `C`
be the integral closure of a Noetherian ring `A` in a purely inseparable extension `M` of a field
`K` over `A`, of exponent at most `n`. (In the application `K` is the fraction field of `A`; the
argument only uses the tower `A → K → M`, so that is not assumed.) Let `A'` be an integral
closure of `A` in a field `K'` over `K`, finite over `A`, such that for a generating set `s` of
`M` over `K` the `p ^ n`-th power of each `x ∈ s` (an element of `K`) becomes a `p ^ n`-th power
of an element of `A'` in `K'`. Then `M` embeds into `K'` over `K`, and `C` is a finite
`A`-module. -/

The lemmas below are the instance-free steps of
`IsIntegralClosure.finite_mvPolynomial_of_isPurelyInseparable`, split out to keep that proof
readable. Its `Algebra`/`IsScalarTower` plumbing is deliberately *not* split out: building those
instances away from their use site creates diamonds against
`OreLocalization.instSMulOfIsScalarTower`. -/
