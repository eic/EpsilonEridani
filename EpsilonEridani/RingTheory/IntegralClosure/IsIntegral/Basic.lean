# Changing the base ring of an integrality claim

Mathlib's `isIntegral_trans` transfers integrality down a scalar tower `R → A → B`. The variant
here drops the tower: the two candidate base rings are only required to map compatibly into the
ring where the element lives, which is what happens when both of them sit inside that ring
without either being an algebra over the other.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isIntegral_trans_common`: if every element of `P` becomes integral over `R` once
  mapped into `L`, then an element of `L` integral over `P` is integral over `R`.
