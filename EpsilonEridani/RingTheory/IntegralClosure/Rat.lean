# Rational algebraic integers

`ℤ` is integrally closed in `ℚ`, so an algebraic integer that happens to be rational is an
integer. This file records the numerical reading of that fact: an identity `n · z = m` between an
algebraic integer `z` and two natural numbers is a divisibility `n ∣ m`. It holds over an
arbitrary field of characteristic zero, `z = m / n` being the image of a rational number there and
integrality descending along `algebraMap ℚ k`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.dvd_of_isIntegral_of_natCast_mul_eq`: if `(n : k) * z = m` with `z` integral over `ℤ`
  in a field of characteristic zero and `n ≠ 0`, then `n ∣ m`.
