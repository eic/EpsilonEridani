# Integrality as an explicit monic relation of positive degree

`IsIntegral S x` says a monic polynomial over `S` kills `x`. For arguments that adjust the
coefficients one at a time it is more convenient to have the relation written out, and written
so that its degree is visibly positive:

```text
x ^ (n + 1) + ∑ i ∈ Finset.range (n + 1), c i * x ^ i = 0,   with `c i ∈ S` for `i < n + 1`.
```

This file gives that form and its converse. Both directions are pure ring theory — no topology
appears — and they are stated for a subring of an arbitrary commutative ring.

Writing the degree as `n + 1` rather than carrying a separate `0 < p.natDegree` hypothesis is
what lets a caller perturb the constant coefficient without disturbing the leading one, which is
the shape Huber's approximation arguments need.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_pow_add_sum_eq_zero_of_isIntegral`: an integral element satisfies such a
  relation.
* `EpsilonEridani.isIntegral_of_pow_add_sum_eq_zero`: conversely, such a relation exhibits integrality.

/-- An element integral over a subring `S` satisfies a monic relation of positive degree whose
coefficients lie in `S`. Membership is asserted only on `i < n + 1`, the range the relation sums
over; a caller reading off coefficients gets no promise about the tail and needs none. Writing the
degree as `n + 1` builds the positivity into the shape, which is what lets the constant coefficient
be adjusted without disturbing the leading one. -/
