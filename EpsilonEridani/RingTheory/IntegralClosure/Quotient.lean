# Integrality over an algebra, tested on quotients

A failure of `x : R` to be integral over `A` is already a failure modulo a **prime** ideal of `R`.
That is what this file proves, together with the elementary description of integrality in a
quotient that the argument runs on: `x` becomes integral over `A` in `R ⧸ J` exactly when some
monic polynomial over `A` sends `x` into `J`.

The point of reaching a *prime* is that `R ⧸ J` is then a **domain**. So a theorem about integral
elements proved only for domains extends to an arbitrary commutative ring, as long as its
hypothesis survives pulling back along `Ideal.Quotient.mk J`. The valuative criterion
`EpsilonEridani.isIntegral_of_forall_valuation_le_one` — the hard direction of Wedhorn's Proposition
7.18 — is such a theorem, and is what this file was written for.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isIntegral_quotient_iff` : integrality of `x` over `A` after passing to `R ⧸ J` is the
  statement that some monic polynomial over `A` sends `x` into `J`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isIntegral_of_forall_isPrime` : if `x` becomes integral over `A` in every prime
  quotient of `R`, then it is integral over `A`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isIntegral_of_forall_isPrime_map` : the same for a subring `B ⊆ R`, phrased with the
  image subring `B.map (Ideal.Quotient.mk J)` that a criterion quantifying over subrings of
  `R ⧸ J` needs.

The first of these needs only a ring and a two-sided ideal; commutativity enters with the prime,
so the other two ask for it.

Mathlib's integrality-in-a-quotient lemmas, `RingHom.IsIntegral.quotient` and
`isIntegral_quotientMap_iff`, say that a *ring hom* is integral, with source and target both
quotiented. The criterion here is about a single element, keeps `A` unquotiented, and hands back
the monic witness, which is what the argument below consumes.

## Method

The statement is the positive one — integral in every prime quotient implies integral — and the
argument runs on its contrapositive, which is where the prime comes from.

The values `f(x)` of monic polynomials `f` over `A` form a **submonoid** of `R`: monic
polynomials are closed under multiplication and evaluation is multiplicative, and `f = 1` gives
the unit. Non-integrality of `x` says exactly that `0` is not one of those values — that the zero
ideal is disjoint from the submonoid. `Ideal.exists_le_prime_disjoint` then supplies a **prime**
ideal still disjoint from it, and `isIntegral_quotient_iff` reads that disjointness back as
non-integrality in the quotient.

Packaging the monic values as a submonoid is the whole trick: the multiplicative closure Mathlib's
Zorn argument needs is precisely "a product of monic polynomials is monic", so no bespoke
maximality argument is required here, and no finiteness or noetherian hypothesis on `R` appears.

The subring form is a corollary rather than a separate argument. Only one direction of the
comparison is needed — that integrality over the image subring implies integrality over `B` —
and it holds because `B` surjects onto that image, so a monic polynomial over the image lifts to
a monic polynomial over `B`.

This is what lets a criterion for integrality that has been proved only for domains be applied to
an arbitrary commutative ring: every `R ⧸ J` here is a domain, so the criterion supplies exactly
the hypotheses this lemma consumes. -/
