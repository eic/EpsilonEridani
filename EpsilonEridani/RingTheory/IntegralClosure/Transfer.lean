# Transport principles for integral closures and their finiteness

Two general facts that the finiteness of integral closures is assembled from, each stated in the
abstract typeclass form `IsIntegralClosure`, and independent of each other.

* Descending the base: an integral closure of `A` in `B` is also the integral closure of `R` in
  `B` when `A` is integral over `R` — the converse of Mathlib's `IsIntegralClosure.tower_top`,
  and Stacks, Lemma 10.36.16 (tag 0308).
* Descending along an embedding: if the integral closure of `A` in a bigger ring is a finite
  module over the Noetherian ring `A`, so is the integral closure in a ring that embeds into it —
  the "as `R` is Noetherian it suffices to enlarge the field" step that Stacks uses in
  Lemmas 10.161.5, 10.161.12 and 10.161.13.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsIntegralClosure.tower_bot`: the integral closure of `A` in `B` is the integral
  closure of `R` in `B` when `A` is integral over `R`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsIntegralClosure.finite_of_injective`: finiteness of an integral closure descends
  along an injective `A`-algebra map of the top rings, over a Noetherian `A`.

## Provenance

Roadmap: EllipticCurves, the Layers 0-1 target *Function-field foundations and isogenies*
(`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:1096`), through the support module
`RingTheory/IntegralClosure/NormalizationFinite`. The statements are Stacks, Lemmas 10.36.16
and 10.36.15(2) (tags 0308, 02JM; "Proof. Omitted") and the Noetherian reduction sentence of
Stacks 10.161.12 (tag 032N). The fraction-field sentence of Stacks 10.161.5 (tag 032I) is
generic localization material and lives in
`EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/Localization/FiniteDimensional.lean`.

/-- Source: Stacks, Lemma 10.36.16 (tag 0308): "Let `A → B → C` be ring maps. Let `B′` be the
integral closure of `A` in `B`, let `C′` be the integral closure of `B′` in `C`. Then `C′` is
the integral closure of `A` in `C`." Here in the form used by normalization-finiteness: if `C` is
the integral closure of `A` in `B` and `A` is integral over `R`, then `C` is the integral closure
of `R` in `B`. The converse of Mathlib's `IsIntegralClosure.tower_top`. -/

`M/K` containing `L`. As `R` is Noetherian it suffices to show that the integral closure of `R`
in `M` is finite over `R`." Finiteness of integral closures descends along injective `A`-algebra
