# The Gauss norm of restricted power series

A restricted power series has finite Gauss norm. At a positive radius, a nonzero restricted
series has a last coefficient attaining that norm; the degree of that coefficient is the
*distinguished degree* of the series, and `IsDistinguished` names the property. Over a
nonarchimedean normed ring with multiplicative norm, a pair of distinguished degrees produces a
dominant coefficient in a product, and the Gauss norm is therefore multiplicative on restricted
series.

The distinguished degree is the datum Weierstrass division and preparation for Tate algebras are
organised around. No completeness hypothesis is needed for the norm identities here. The radius is
any positive real number, including the unit radius of the usual Tate algebra.

Completeness enters only at the end of the file, where a family of restricted series with
summable Gauss norms is summed coefficientwise. This is the convergence statement that
successive-approximation arguments over a complete nonarchimedean ring run on, and it takes the
place of completeness of the Tate algebra for the Gauss norm.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished`: the Gauss norm is attained in degree `s` and every later
  coefficient is strictly smaller.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.gaussNorm_eq_of_forall_le`: the Gauss norm is attained at a degree whose
  weighted coefficient dominates.
* `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.exists_isDistinguished`: at a positive radius, every nonzero restricted
  series is distinguished of some degree.
* `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.unique`: of no more than one degree.
* `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.trunc`,
  `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.gaussNorm_trunc` and
  `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.gaussNorm_sub_trunc_lt`: the polynomial part of a
  distinguished series is distinguished of the same degree and the same Gauss norm, and the
  tail it leaves is strictly smaller.
* `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.norm_coeff_mul_mul_pow_eq_gaussNorm_mul`: the dominant
  coefficient of a product of distinguished series.
* `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.gaussNorm_mul_of_isRestricted`: multiplicativity of the Gauss norm.
* `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.summable_coeff_of_summable_gaussNorm` and
  `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.isRestricted_mk_tsum_coeff`: over a complete ring, a family of restricted
  series with summable Gauss norms has summable coefficients, and its coefficientwise sum is
  again restricted.

## References

* Bosch, Güntzer, Remmert, *Non-Archimedean Analysis*, §5.2.

The dominant-coefficient argument follows Mathlib's proof of `Polynomial.gaussNorm_mul`;
restrictedness replaces the finite-support argument for attaining the maximum. We use Mathlib's
`PowerSeries.IsRestricted` and `PowerSeries.gaussNorm` throughout.

variable (c) (s) (f)

/-- `f` is **distinguished of degree `s`** at the radius `c` when its Gauss norm at `c` is attained
in degree `s` and every later coefficient is strictly smaller.

At the unit radius this is a norm-theoretic analogue of the classical condition that the leading
coefficient of `f` dominates, in the sense of Bosch–Güntzer–Remmert §5.2. At a positive radius, a
nonzero restricted series is distinguished of exactly one degree
(`EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.exists_isDistinguished` and
`EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.unique`), so this is a genuine invariant of `f` and `c` rather
than extra data.

The first field is the univariate reading of Mathlib's `MvPowerSeries.AchievesGaussNorm`; the
second is what makes the degree unique and pins down the dominant coefficient of a product.

This is unrelated to `Polynomial.IsDistinguishedAt`, which asks a polynomial to be monic with its
remaining coefficients in an ideal. -/
