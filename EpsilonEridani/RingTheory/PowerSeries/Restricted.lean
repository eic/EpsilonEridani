# Restricted power series with a vanishing tail

Mathlib's `PowerSeries.IsRestricted` asks the weighted coefficient norms of a power series to
tend to zero. A series whose coefficients vanish in every degree past some bound — a polynomial —
satisfies that condition at every radius, and this file records the resulting introduction rule.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.isRestricted_of_forall_coeff_eq_zero`: a series with a vanishing tail is
  restricted at every radius.

/-- A power series whose coefficients vanish in every degree `≥ n` is restricted at every radius:
its weighted coefficient norms are eventually zero. Such a series is a polynomial of degree less
than `n`. -/
