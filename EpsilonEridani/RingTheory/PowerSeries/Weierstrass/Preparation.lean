# Weierstrass preparation for restricted power series

The power series restricted at a radius `c` form a subring `PowerSeries.IsRestricted.subring c`
of `K⟦X⟧`; over a complete nonarchimedean field and at a positive radius it is the Tate algebra of
the closed disc of radius `c`. This file describes its units and factors a distinguished series
through a monic polynomial.

A restricted series is a unit of that subring exactly when it is distinguished of degree `0`, that
is, when its constant coefficient strictly dominates every positive-degree weighted coefficient
and attains the Gauss norm. Weierstrass preparation then says that a restricted series `f`
distinguished of degree `s` factors as

```text
f = e * ω,    e a unit of the ring of restricted series,    ω monic of degree s,
```

and that the pair `(e, ω)` is unique. Both statements come from Weierstrass division. Dividing `1`
by a series distinguished of degree `0` leaves a remainder that vanishes in every degree, so the
quotient is an inverse. Dividing `X ^ s` by `f` leaves a remainder `r` of degree less than `s`
whose weighted coefficients are bounded by `c ^ s`, so `ω = X ^ s - r` is distinguished of degree
`s`; the quotient is then distinguished of degree `0`, hence a unit, and `f` is its inverse
times `ω`.

The factorization presents the quotient of the ring of restricted series by `f` as the quotient of
`K[X]` by a polynomial of degree `s`, which is the route to noetherianity of the Tate algebra.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.isDistinguished_zero_of_isUnit` and
  `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.isUnit_iff_isDistinguished_zero`: a restricted series is a unit of the ring
  of restricted series exactly when it is distinguished of degree `0`.
* `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.of_isUnit_mul`: multiplying by such a unit leaves the
  distinguished degree unchanged.
* `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.exists_isUnit_isMonicOfDegree_mul_eq`,
  `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.eq_and_eq_of_mul_eq_mul` and
  `EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.existsUnique_isUnit_isMonicOfDegree_mul_eq`: Weierstrass
  preparation, in its existence, uniqueness and unique-existence forms.

## References

* Bosch, Güntzer, Remmert, *Non-Archimedean Analysis*, §5.2.2, Theorem 1, whose statement this is;
  the statement there is for the unit radius, and the argument is the one used here.

Mathlib's `PowerSeries.exists_isWeierstrassFactorization` is a different factorization theorem, for
the divisors of `Mathlib.RingTheory.PowerSeries.WeierstrassPreparation`: there the series lives over
an `I`-adically complete coefficient ring, the distinguished polynomial is one whose lower
coefficients lie in `I`, and the unit is a unit of the whole of `A⟦X⟧`. Here the coefficient field
is complete for an ultrametric norm, the polynomial is monic with its lower coefficients bounded by
the Gauss norm, and the unit is a unit of the subring of restricted series. Neither statement
implies the other.

nonarchimedean field, a restricted series `f` distinguished of degree `s` at a positive radius `c`
is a unit of the ring of restricted series times a monic polynomial of degree `s`:

```text
f = e * ω,    e a unit,    ω monic of degree s.
```

The polynomial `ω` is then itself distinguished of degree `s`, by
`EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.of_isUnit_mul`, so no bound on its lower coefficients needs
stating separately. The factorization is unique by
`EpsilonEridani.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.eq_and_eq_of_mul_eq_mul`. -/
