# Self-convolution coefficients of a formal power series

`PowerSeries.coeff_mul` gives the coefficients of a product as a sum over `Finset.antidiagonal`.
For a recursion that reads off one coefficient from strictly earlier ones the equivalent sum over
`Finset.range` is what is wanted, so this file names the two shapes that occur, for a square and
for a cube, and records the translation.

Both are stated for an arbitrary coefficient function `f : ℕ → R` rather than for the
coefficients of a given series: the congruence lemmas compare two such functions, and the
truncation lemmas feed in a modified one.

The load-bearing facts are `PowerSeries.selfConvTwo_congr` and `PowerSeries.selfConvThree_congr`.
When `f 0 = 0` the convolution at index `n` depends only on the values of `f` strictly below `n`,
because the extreme terms of the sum each carry a factor `f 0`. That is what makes a recursion
defined through these convolutions well founded.

## Main definitions

* `PowerSeries.selfConvTwo`, `PowerSeries.selfConvThree`: the `Finset.range`-form convolution
  sums computing the coefficients of a square and of a cube.

## Main results

* `PowerSeries.selfConvTwo_def`, `PowerSeries.selfConvThree_def`: the defining formulas, as
  named lemmas. Rewrite with these rather than unfolding the definitions.
* `PowerSeries.coeff_pow_two_eq_selfConvTwo`,
  `PowerSeries.coeff_pow_three_eq_selfConvThree`: those sums do compute the coefficients of
  `w ^ 2` and `w ^ 3`.
* `PowerSeries.coeff_mul_congr`: the `n`-th coefficient of `q * v`, for `q` with vanishing
  constant coefficient, depends only on the coefficients of `v` strictly below `n`.
* `PowerSeries.selfConvTwo_congr_le`, `PowerSeries.selfConvThree_congr_le`: the convolution at
  `m` depends only on the values of the function on `[0, m]`. No hypothesis is needed.
* `PowerSeries.selfConvTwo_congr`, `PowerSeries.selfConvThree_congr`: for a function vanishing at
  `0`, that bound sharpens to the values strictly below `n`.
* `PowerSeries.selfConvTwo_truncate`, `PowerSeries.selfConvThree_truncate` and their
  `_of_lt` companions: truncating the function above `n` leaves the convolution unchanged at `n`
  (needing `f 0 = 0`) and at every smaller index (needing nothing).
* `PowerSeries.selfConvTwo_eq_zero`, `PowerSeries.selfConvThree_eq_zero`: a function vanishing
  below `d` has square vanishing below `2 * d` and cube vanishing below `3 * d`.

## Provenance

Adapted from the AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, pinned
by `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` at `dev/hasse-weil @ 513e83879e2f`),
`HasseWeil/FormalGroup.lean`, declarations `conv₂` and `conv₃` together with the coefficient
lemmas `coeff_formalW_sq` and `coeff_formalW_cube`.

Changes from the source. The source states its two convolution-coefficient lemmas only for its
`formalW`, although neither proof uses anything about that series; they are stated here for an
arbitrary series. The truncation lemmas likewise assumed `formalW`, and are stated here for any
`f` vanishing at `0`, as consequences of the sharper congruence lemmas. The source works
throughout over a `CommRing`; nothing here needs more than a `Semiring`.
