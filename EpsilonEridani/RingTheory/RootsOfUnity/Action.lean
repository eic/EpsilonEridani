# The roots of unity are preserved by an action by monoid endomorphisms

A monoid `G` acting on `Mˣ` by monoid endomorphisms preserves `ζ ^ n = 1`, so the subgroup
`rootsOfUnity n M` is `G`-stable and inherits the action. This file records that stability and
installs the inherited `MulDistribMulAction`.

The intended instance is the absolute Galois group acting on `μₙ ⊆ (Kˢ)ˣ`, where the action is in
general nontrivial and is exactly what the Kummer isomorphism depends on; the statement needs
nothing about fields, so it is proved for an arbitrary action by monoid endomorphisms.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.smul_mem_rootsOfUnity`: `rootsOfUnity n M` is stable under the action.
* `EpsilonEridani.rootsOfUnity.mulDistribMulAction`: the inherited action on `rootsOfUnity n M`.
