# Extending the scalars of a subring of a rational algebra

Let `A` be a `ℚ`-algebra and `R` a subring of `A`. Because `R` is a ring and not a `ℚ`-subalgebra,
it can be a genuine lattice: an integral structure whose rational span is all of `A`. This file
builds the comparison map

```text
ratBaseChange R : ℚ ⊗[ℤ] R →ₐ[ℚ] A,     q ⊗ₜ r ↦ q • r
```

records that its range is exactly the `ℚ`-span of `R`, and proves that it is always injective.
Consequently it is an isomorphism exactly when that span is everything, which is what it means for
`R` to be a `ℤ`-form of `A`.

Injectivity holds with no hypothesis on `R` and is the reason the file exists: every element of
`ℚ ⊗[ℤ] M`, for any additive group `M`, has a common denominator, so it is a single elementary
tensor `(n : ℚ)⁻¹ ⊗ₜ m` rather than a sum of them. That normal form,
`EpsilonEridani.exists_tmul_inv_natCast`, is proved first and is purely module-theoretic. It also turns
the spanning hypothesis into the concrete statement `Subring.exists_natCast_smul_mem`, that every
element of `A` is carried into `R` by some nonzero natural number.

## Main definitions

* `Subring.ratBaseChange`: the canonical `ℚ`-algebra map `ℚ ⊗[ℤ] R → A`.
* `Subring.ratBaseChangeEquiv`: that map as an isomorphism, given a spanning subring.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_tmul_inv_natCast`: an element of `ℚ ⊗[ℤ] M` has a common denominator.
* `Subring.ratBaseChange_injective`: the comparison map is injective.
* `Subring.range_ratBaseChange`: its range is the `ℚ`-span of `R`.
* `Subring.span_eq_top_iff_exists_natCast_smul_mem`: a subring spans exactly when denominators can
  be cleared.

/-- Every element of `ℚ ⊗[ℤ] M` is a single elementary tensor with a natural-number denominator:
the rational coefficients of a finite sum can be put over a common denominator, and the numerators
absorbed into the right-hand factor.

This is `IsLocalizedModule.mk'_surjective` read through
`IsLocalization.tensorProduct_isLocalizedModule`, which exhibits `ℚ ⊗[ℤ] M` as the localization of
`M` at the positive integers; the denominator produced there is a positive integer, and its
absolute value is the natural number below. -/
