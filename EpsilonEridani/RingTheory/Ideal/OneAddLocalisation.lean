# Localising at `1 + I`

For an ideal `I` of a semiring `B`, the set `1 + I` is a submonoid of `B`. If `B` is commutative,
`I` is finitely generated, and its image in a localisation at `1 + I` lies in every prime there,
then a single element of `1 + I` annihilates a power of `I`.

Over a commutative *ring* that annihilator makes the powers of `I` constant, which is the form
Wedhorn's argument actually uses and the one stated last below: its conclusion mentions neither the
localisation nor the submonoid.

Only these implications are proved here, and only under `I.FG`; the converses are not stated.

The nilpotence step is not about localisation at all and lives in
`EpsilonEridani.RingTheory.Ideal.Nilpotent` as `Ideal.exists_pow_map_eq_bot`. Localisation enters here,
to turn "the image of `I ^ n` is zero" into an annihilator lying in `1 + I`.

## Main results

* `Ideal.oneAdd`: `1 + I` as a submonoid of an arbitrary semiring `B`. Membership is recorded
  existentially, as `∃ a ∈ I, x = 1 + a`, so that no subtraction is needed.
* `Ideal.exists_mem_oneAdd_forall_mul_eq_zero`: if `I` is finitely generated and its image in a
  localisation `C` at `1 + I` is contained in every prime of `C`, there is a single `s ∈ 1 + I`
  with `s * x = 0` for every `x ∈ I ^ n`.
* `Ideal.exists_forall_pow_eq_pow`: over a commutative ring, the same hypotheses make the powers
  of `I` constant from some point on.

## References

* T. Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*, arXiv:1910.05934v1, Proposition 7.49(2). The construction here
  follows the argument of that proposition's proof, which localises at `1 + I` in exactly this
  way; the statements below are stated for their own sake and do not mention `Spa`.

/-- **The powers of `I` are eventually constant.** If `I` is a finitely generated ideal of a
commutative ring `B` whose image in a localisation `C` at `1 + I` lies in every prime of `C`, then
`I ^ k = I ^ n` for some `n` and all `k ≥ n`.

This is the closing step of Wedhorn's proof of Proposition 7.49(2), and the reason the localisation
is introduced there at all. Note what the conclusion does *not* mention: neither `C` nor `1 + I`
survives it, so a caller who has discharged the hypothesis is left with a statement purely about
`I`. -/
