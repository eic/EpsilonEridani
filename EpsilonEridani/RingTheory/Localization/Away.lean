# The fraction `t/s` in an away localisation

A localisation `S` of `A` away from `s` inverts `s`, so it contains `t/s` for every `t : A`.
Mathlib names the inverse itself — `IsLocalization.Away.invSelf s` is `1/s` — but not the general
fraction; this file names it and gives the identities that manipulating it needs: scaling `1/s`
by `t`, and clearing the denominator on either side.

Nothing here is topological or Huber-specific — it is `IsLocalization` algebra over an arbitrary
commutative semiring, for an arbitrary localisation away from `s` — so it is stated outside the
Huber namespace, alongside `EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/Localization/DenIdeal.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Localization.divBy`: the element `t/s` of a localisation away from `s`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Localization.divBy_one`: `1/s` is Mathlib's `IsLocalization.Away.invSelf`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Localization.invSelf_mul_algebraMap`: scaling `1/s` by `t` gives `t/s`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Localization.algebraMap_mul_divBy` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Localization.divBy_mul_algebraMap`: `s · (t/s) = t` in both orders.
* `EpsilonEridani.Localization.divBy_zero`, `EpsilonEridani.Localization.divBy_add` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Localization.divBy_mul`: `t/s` is additive and `A`-linear in the
  numerator.
* `EpsilonEridani.Localization.divBy_mul_cancel_left` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Localization.divBy_mul_cancel_right`: `(s · t)/s = t` and `(t · s)/s = t`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Localization.divBy_mul_mul_left` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Localization.divBy_mul_mul_right`: `(u · t)/(u · s) = t/s` and `(t · u)/(s · u) = t/s`,
  given that `S` is a localisation away from the rescaled denominator as well.
* `EpsilonEridani.Localization.divBy_self`: `s/s = 1`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Localization.adjoin_invSelf_eq_top`: `S` is generated over `A` by `1/s`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Localization.adjoin_divBy_eq_top`: as soon as the numerators `T` together with the
  denominator `s` generate the unit ideal, the fractions `t/s` alone already generate `S` over
  `A`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Localization.divBy_mul_divBy_of_eq_mul`: for `s = u * r`, the fraction `(a · b)/s`
  splits as `(a · r)/s · (b · u)/s`, each half carrying one factor of the denominator.
* `EpsilonEridani.Localization.isUnit_of_comp_algebraMap`: a ring homomorphism out of the localisation
  whose restriction along `algebraMap A S` is `φ` makes `φ s` a unit.
* `EpsilonEridani.Localization.map_divBy_eq_mul_inv`: such a homomorphism sends `t/s` to
  `φ t * (φ s)⁻¹`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Localization.awayLift_divBy`: the comparison map to a localisation at a multiple
  `w = u * r` rescales fractions by the cofactor, sending `a/u` to `(a · r)/w`.
* `RingHom.awayMap_divBy`: the map induced on localisations by a ring homomorphism
  `f` pushes fractions along `f`, sending `a/u` to `f(a)/f(u)`.

## Provenance

`divBy` and its identities are ported from AINTLIB's
`projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/LocalizationTopology.lean`, branch `dev/adic-spaces`, commit
`d9f2fbbb`, where they are stated for the concrete `Localization.Away s` over a commutative ring
inside the Huber development. They are generalised here to an arbitrary `IsLocalization.Away`
over a commutative semiring, linked to Mathlib's `IsLocalization.Away.invSelf`, and moved out of
the Huber namespace because nothing about them is topological. The topological part of that port
is `EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/Huber/LocalizationTopology/Basic.lean`, which records the same provenance.

`divBy_mul_divBy_of_eq_mul`, `awayLift_divBy` and `awayMap_divBy` are **later additions with no
AINTLIB analogue** — checked against `dev/adic-spaces` at commit `37bbdaeb9`, which has neither the
splitting identity for a factored denominator nor any statement about `IsLocalization.Away.lift` on
distinguished fractions, and does not mention `IsLocalization.Away.map` at all. All three are
proved here directly from Mathlib's `mk'` API.

`adjoin_invSelf_eq_top` and `adjoin_divBy_eq_top` are **also later additions with no AINTLIB
analogue**, checked against the same commit. What that source has is
`locSubring_isNoetherianRing`, which presents the *ring of definition* `A₀[t₁/s, …, tₙ/s]` as an
image of `MvPolynomial T A₀`; that surjectivity is true by construction, since `locSubring` is
defined as the adjoin, and it says nothing about the localisation `S` itself. Generating the whole
of `S` over `A` is a strictly stronger statement and needs the hypothesis on `T` below, which the
source never states.

`map_divBy_eq_mul_inv` is a **generalisation of an AINTLIB statement**, checked against the same
commit. There, `awayLift_divByS_one_eq_unit_inv` in
`projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/WedhornAwayMapSaturation.lean` records the numerator-`1` case
for `IsLocalization.Away.lift` into `Localization.Away s`; the version here has an arbitrary
numerator, an arbitrary localisation away from `s`, and an arbitrary homomorphism out of it,
asking only that it restrict to `φ` along `algebraMap`, from which `isUnit_of_comp_algebraMap`
recovers the unit the inverse is taken at. The proof is written here directly from
`divBy_mul_algebraMap`.

That extra instance is what the hypothesis really is: for a unit `u` it comes for free, since
`u * s` and `s` are then associated and `IsLocalization.Away.of_associated` transports the
localisation. Rescaling a denominator *alone* need not preserve the fraction; rescaling numerator
and denominator together always does, which is what a construction indexed by a presentation
needs. -/

/-! ### The numerator

`divBy` is additive and `A`-linear in its numerator. The body is not exported, so without these
a consumer computing with `t/s` — products of the generators of a localisation subring are
exactly such fractions — has to `rw [divBy_def]` down to `IsLocalization.mk'`. Each is read off
`invSelf_mul_algebraMap`, which turns the fraction into a product with a fixed left factor. -/

/-- `s/s = 1`. Without this the simp set turns `invSelf s * algebraMap A S s` into `divBy s s`
and stops, where before `invSelf_mul_algebraMap` it could reach `1` through Mathlib's
`IsLocalization.Away.mul_invSelf`. -/
@[simp]
theorem divBy_self : (divBy s s : S) = 1 := by

/-! ### A factored denominator

When `s` factors as `u * r`, a fraction over `s` can be split so that each half carries one factor,
and a fraction over `u` alone can be rewritten over `s`. These are the identities that let a
presentation be replaced by one with a larger denominator. -/

/-- **Splitting a fraction over a factored denominator.** If `s = u * r` then `(a · b)/s` factors as
`(a · r)/s · (b · u)/s`: each half keeps one factor of the denominator, so `a/u` and `b/r` are
recovered as fractions over `s` itself.

Both sides agree after multiplying by `s`, which is a unit. This is what turns a product of
denominators into a product of two fractions over the *common* denominator, so that each can be
recognised separately. -/
theorem divBy_mul_divBy_of_eq_mul {u r : A} (h : s = u * r) (a b : A) :
    divBy (a * b) s = (divBy (a * r) s : S) * divBy (b * u) s := by

/-! ### Maps out of the localisation

A ring homomorphism out of `S` is determined by its restriction along `algebraMap A S`, and what
it does to a distinguished fraction is forced: `t/s` goes to the ratio of the images. Nothing is
asked of the target, and nothing of the homomorphism beyond its restriction — that restriction
already makes the image of the denominator a unit — so this covers every map out of `S` at once
rather than the particular ones `IsLocalization.Away.lift` and `IsLocalization.Away.map` build
below. -/

/-- **A homomorphism out of the localisation makes the denominator a unit.** If `ψ : S →+* B`
restricts along `algebraMap A S` to `φ`, then `φ s` is a unit: it is the image under `ψ` of
`algebraMap A S s`, which `S` inverts. -/
theorem isUnit_of_comp_algebraMap {B : Type*} [Semiring B] {φ : A →+* B} {ψ : S →+* B}
    (hψ : ∀ a : A, ψ (algebraMap A S a) = φ a) : IsUnit (φ s) :=
  hψ s ▸ (IsLocalization.Away.algebraMap_isUnit (S := S) s).map ψ

/-- **A homomorphism out of the localisation sends `t/s` to `φ t / φ s`.** If `ψ : S →+* B`
restricts along `algebraMap A S` to `φ`, then `ψ (t/s) = φ t * (φ s)⁻¹`, the inverse taken at the
unit `isUnit_of_comp_algebraMap` supplies.

Nothing is asked of `ψ` beyond the factoring hypothesis, so the statement holds for every
homomorphism out of `S` restricting to `φ`, and it records the value they are all forced to take
on a distinguished fraction. -/
theorem map_divBy_eq_mul_inv {B : Type*} [Semiring B] {φ : A →+* B} {ψ : S →+* B}
    (hψ : ∀ a : A, ψ (algebraMap A S a) = φ a) :

/-! ### Passing to a localisation at a multiple

A localisation away from `u` maps to a localisation away from any multiple `w = u * r`, by
`IsLocalization.Away.lift` at the unit `IsLocalization.Away.isUnit_of_dvd` supplies. The one thing
a consumer needs to know about that map is what it does to fractions, and the answer is that it
rescales numerator and denominator by the cofactor. -/

/-- **The comparison map rescales fractions by the cofactor**: if `w = u * r` then the map
`Aᵤ → A_w` induced by `IsLocalization.Away.lift` sends `a/u` to `(a · r)/w`.

Both sides become `a` after multiplying by `u`, which is a unit in `A_w`, so they agree. This is
what lets a fraction over the coarser denominator be recognised as a *distinguished* fraction of
the finer presentation. -/
theorem awayLift_divBy {V W : Type*} [CommSemiring V] [CommSemiring W] [Algebra A V] [Algebra A W]
    (u r w : A) (hw : w = u * r) [IsLocalization.Away u V] [IsLocalization.Away w W]

  rw [divBy_def, IsLocalization.Away.lift, IsLocalization.lift_mk'_spec, ← divBy_mul,
    show u * (a * r) = a * w by rw [hw]; ring, divBy_mul_cancel_right]

/-! ### Changing the base ring

A ring homomorphism `f : A →+* B` carries a localisation away from `u` to one away from `f u`, by
`IsLocalization.Away.map`. As above, the one thing a consumer needs to know about that map is what
it does to fractions, and the answer is that it pushes numerator and denominator along `f`. -/

/-- **The induced map pushes a fraction along the homomorphism**: the map `A_u → B_{f(u)}` that
`IsLocalization.Away.map` builds from `f : A →+* B` sends `a/u` to `f(a)/f(u)`.

Both sides are the fraction `IsLocalization.mk'` of the images, so nothing is rescaled. This is the
companion of `awayLift_divBy` for a moving base ring: there the base ring is fixed and the
denominator is replaced by a multiple, here the denominator is carried along and the base ring
changes. -/

/-! ### The fractions generate

A localisation away from `s` is generated over `A` by `1/s` alone; and as soon as the numerators
together with `s` generate the unit ideal, already by the fractions `t/s` themselves. Including `s`
among the generators is what makes the second statement usable: its own fraction `s/s` is `1`, so
the term it contributes after dividing through is a constant, not a further fraction. Nothing
topological enters —
this is the algebraic half of the statement that a rational localisation is a quotient of a
polynomial ring, one variable per numerator.

Neither statement is phrased as a surjectivity of `MvPolynomial.aeval`, although that is what
each of them says: Mathlib's `Algebra.adjoin_range_eq_range_aeval` rewrites one into the other,
and stating it here would cost the file an `MvPolynomial` import to say what a consumer can
already say in a line. -/

/-- **A localisation away from `s` is generated over `A` by `1/s`.** Every element is `a/sⁿ`,
which is `a · (1/s)ⁿ`. -/

  exact Algebra.subset_adjoin rfl

/-- **Numerators generating the unit ideal together with `s` make their fractions generate the
localisation.** If `T ∪ {s}` spans `A` as an ideal then `S` is already `A[t/s : t ∈ T]` — no
separate `1/s` is needed.

Including `s` among the generators costs nothing and is what the intended application supplies:
writing `1 = c · s + ∑ cₜ · t` and dividing by `s` exhibits `1/s` as `c + ∑ cₜ · (t/s)`, after
which `adjoin_invSelf_eq_top` finishes. The `c · s` term contributes the coefficient `c`, which
lies in `A` and so is already in the subalgebra; that is why `s` may be one of the generators
without being one of the numerators. The hypothesis cannot be dropped: over
`A = ℤ` with `s = p` and `T = ∅` the fractions generate only `ℤ`, not `ℤ[1/p]`.

The hypothesis is exactly what Wedhorn's rational subsets supply: there `T · A` is required to be
*open*, and an open ideal of a Tate ring is `⊤` by
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsTateRing.eq_top_of_isOpen`. -/
