# The localisation of a domain at a prime, inside an abstract fraction field

Let `R` be a domain with fraction field `K` and let `p` be a prime ideal of `R`. The localisation
`Localization.AtPrime p` embeds in `K`, and `K` is again its fraction field. Mathlib records this
only for `K = FractionRing R`: the instance `IsLocalization.instAlgebraLocalizationAtPrime`, and
the `IsScalarTower` and `IsFractionRing` instances beside it, all target
`Localization (nonZeroDivisors R)` on the nose. A statement about a Dedekind domain `O` and *some*
fraction field `K` — a number field `K` with `O = 𝓞 K`, say — cannot use them.

This file supplies the same three instances for an arbitrary fraction field `K`, from
`Ideal.primeCompl_le_nonZeroDivisors`, exactly as Mathlib builds the `FractionRing` case. For
`K = FractionRing R` the new `Algebra` instance is definitionally the existing one: both are
`IsLocalization.localizationAlgebraOfSubmonoidLe` for `p.primeCompl ≤ nonZeroDivisors R`, an
`abbrev`, and they differ only in the proof of that inequality.

## Main declarations

* `Localization.AtPrime.algebraOfIsFractionRing : Algebra (Localization.AtPrime p) K`, the lift of
  `algebraMap R K` along the localisation;
* `Localization.AtPrime.isScalarTower_of_isFractionRing : IsScalarTower R (Localization.AtPrime p)
  K`, saying that lift extends `algebraMap R K`;
* `Localization.AtPrime.isFractionRing : IsFractionRing (Localization.AtPrime p) K`.

They are global instances: the point of stating them once is that every consumer — first the
global minimal models of `EpsilonEridani/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/GlobalMinimalModel.lean`, where
the localisation is at a height-one prime of a Dedekind domain — finds them by instance search
rather than installing them locally at each use site. The `Algebra` instance carries data and is
`noncomputable`, as `IsLocalization.lift` is.

The height-one-prime specialisation, where the localisation is moreover a discrete valuation ring,
and its valuation bound are in `EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/LocalizationAtPrime.lean`.

/-- The localisation of a domain `R` at a prime `p` maps to any fraction field `K` of `R`: the
`Algebra` structure lifting `algebraMap R K`, which inverts every element outside `p` because
those are nonzero. For `K = FractionRing R` this is definitionally Mathlib's
`IsLocalization.instAlgebraLocalizationAtPrime`. -/
