# The constant coordinate of a power basis

An `R`-algebra `S` with a power basis `1, x, …, x ^ (d - 1)` retracts onto `R`: the coordinate
along `x ^ 0 = 1` is an `R`-linear map `S → R` sending `1` to `1`. So `R · 1` is a direct summand of
`S`, which is what it takes to descend a span over `S` back to a span over `R`
(`EpsilonEridani.mem_of_mem_span_of_mem_closure`). Through `Algebra.adjoin.powerBasis'` this applies to
`ℤ[ζ]` for a root of unity `ζ` in a field of characteristic zero.

## Main statements

* `PowerBasis.exists_linearMap_apply_one`: an algebra with a power basis retracts onto its scalars.
