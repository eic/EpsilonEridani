# Unramifiedness of a local algebra at its maximal ideal

`Algebra.IsUnramifiedAt R q` is formal unramifiedness over `R` of the localization of the ambient
algebra at the prime `q`. When the ambient algebra `S` is already local and `q` is its maximal
ideal, that localization is `S` itself, because every element outside the maximal ideal is
already a unit. This file records the resulting equivalence, which is what lets a formal
unramifiedness statement about a local ring be read by Mathlib's unramified-locus API, and
conversely.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isUnramifiedAt_maximalIdeal_iff`: a local `R`-algebra is unramified at its maximal
  ideal exactly when it is formally unramified over `R`.
