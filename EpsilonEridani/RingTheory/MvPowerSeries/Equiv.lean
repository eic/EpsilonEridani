# Coefficients of a one-variable power series viewed in one variable of a family

`PowerSeries.toMvPowerSeries i` views a one-variable power series as a multivariate one in the
single variable `i`. Mathlib records that it is an algebra map, how it acts on `C` and `X`, that
it is injective, and that its coefficients vanish off the powers of `i`
(`PowerSeries.toMvPowerSeries_coeff_eq_zero`); this file adds the remaining half, the value of
the coefficients that do not vanish.

## Main results

* `PowerSeries.coeff_toMvPowerSeries`: the coefficients of `w.toMvPowerSeries i`.

## Provenance

Adapted from Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` project
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, Apache-2.0, pinned by
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` at `66889eada51a`),
`EllipticCurves/WeierstrassFormalGroup/Chord.lean`, the private lemma `coeff_rename_single`.
There it is stated for `MvPowerSeries.rename (fun _ => s)` and only where it is used; here it is
stated for the `PowerSeries.toMvPowerSeries` spelling of that map, which is Mathlib's, and it
carries no elliptic content so it is recorded on its own.
