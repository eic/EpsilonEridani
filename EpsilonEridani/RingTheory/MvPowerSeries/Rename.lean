# Renaming the variables of a multivariate power series

Gaps in Mathlib's `rename` API, in three groups. The first compares a renaming with another
operation on the same series — substitution, evaluation, or reading a single-variable
coefficient — together with one consequence of those comparisons: that reindexing a two-variable
series along `unitSumUnitEquivFinTwo` carries an associativity identity with it. The second says
where a renamed series *vanishes*: at every exponent that is nonzero at a variable outside the
image of the renaming. The third is about two renamings at once — along embeddings with disjoint
images, a common value forces both series to be the same constant.

Substituting after renaming is the substitution along the renamed index, and evaluating after
renaming is the evaluation at the reindexed family: Mathlib has all these operations and the law
that lets them be compared — `rename_eq_subst`, which says a renaming *is* the substitution
sending each variable to a variable — but not the comparisons themselves, which is what a caller
reindexing a series needs.

Reading the coefficient of a single-variable monomial through a renaming along an embedding is
likewise available only through `coeff_embDomain_rename`, which speaks about `Finsupp.embDomain`;
at one variable raised to an arbitrary power the `single (e i) n` spelling is the more usable one.

Associativity is where the two spellings of a two-variable series genuinely diverge: the named
form substitutes an already-substituted series through `pairSubstitution`, the `Fin 2` form
through a `Matrix.cons` family over `Fin 3`. Transporting the identity therefore means
reindexing the three-variable ambient ring as well, along `unitSumUnitSumUnitEquivFinThree`.

## Main results

* `MvPowerSeries.subst_rename`: substituting into `rename e p` reindexes the family, i.e. it is
  substituting `g ∘ e` into `p`.
* `MvPowerSeries.coeff_single_rename`: the coefficient of `rename e p` at the single-variable
  monomial `single (e i) n` is the coefficient of `p` at `single i n`, for any exponent `n`.
* `MvPowerSeries.aeval_rename`: evaluating `rename e p` at a family reindexes the family, i.e. it
  is evaluating `p` at that family precomposed with `e`.
* `MvPowerSeries.rename_unitSumUnitEquivFinTwo_assoc`: reindexing a two-variable associative
  series from `Unit ⊕ Unit` to `Fin 2` preserves its associativity identity.
* `MvPowerSeries.coeff_rename_eq_zero_of_apply_ne_zero`: a renamed series vanishes at every
  exponent that is nonzero at a variable outside the image of the renaming.
* `MvPowerSeries.eq_C_of_rename_eq_rename` and
  `MvPowerSeries.right_eq_C_of_rename_eq_rename`: renamings along embeddings with disjoint images
  agree only when both series are the same constant.

## Provenance

No external source. The first three statements are gaps in Mathlib's `MvPowerSeries` API and each
proof is a few steps of that same API; the fourth is the reindexing they were extracted for, and
its proof rewrites both sides of the identity through the three-variable renaming. The vanishing
and disjointness lemmas are likewise gaps in that API. All of them are recorded here rather than
inside their callers because they carry no content beyond `rename`.

/-- **Substituting into a renamed series reindexes the family**: `rename e p` followed by
substituting `g` is `p` with `g ∘ e` substituted.

Both hypotheses are the ones the two operations already carry: `rename` needs `e` to have finite
fibres (`TendstoCofinite`) for the renamed coefficients to be well defined, and `subst` needs
`HasSubst g`. Nothing is assumed about `e` beyond that — in particular it need not be injective,
since a collision merely substitutes the same series for two variables. -/

evaluating `p` at `a` precomposed with `e`. This is the evaluation counterpart of `subst_rename`,
and Mathlib has neither.

The reindexed family is a separate argument `b` together with the pointwise equation
`b s = a (e s)`, rather than the composite `a ∘ e` itself, because `aeval` carries its family in
the type of its `HasEval` argument: a caller who knows the reindexed family in a simplified form
cannot rewrite it under `aeval` afterwards, and supplying it here is the only way to state the
evaluation it actually wants. -/
