# Resultant lemmas

Mathlib evaluates the resultant against the linear polynomial `X - C x` on either side
(`Polynomial.resultant_X_sub_C_left`, `Polynomial.resultant_X_sub_C_right`). This file records the
companion for the *reversed* polynomial `C x - X`, which is the shape that arises as `x - θ` in
`AdjoinRoot f`: the answer is `f.eval x`, with **no sign**.

The file also normalizes bounded resultants with a monic left argument. This makes the resultant
independent of the chosen valid right degree bound, as needed when comparing resultant-based
discriminant formulas that use different bounds.

That absence is the point. `C x - X` is `C (-1) * (X - C x)`, which contributes `(-1) ^ m`, and
`resultant_X_sub_C_right` contributes another `(-1) ^ m`, so the two cancel.

## Main results

* `Polynomial.resultant_C_sub_X_right`
* `Polynomial.Monic.resultant_of_le`: for a monic left argument, the resultant is independent of
  the valid degree bound supplied for the right argument.
