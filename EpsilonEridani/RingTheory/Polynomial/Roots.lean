# Root sets: numbering the roots, and the roots of a product

This file records two facts about the root set `f.rootSet E` of a polynomial `f` after base
change to a domain `E`.

First, an explicit numbering of the root set of a separable polynomial enumerates its full root
multiset: separability makes the roots simple, so the multiset is the image of the numbering.
This lets root-product formulas be expressed as finite products indexed by `Fin f.natDegree`,
without choosing a global order on the root set.

Second, the root set of a product of polynomials whose base changes to `E` are nonzero is the
union of the root sets of the factors. This is the lemma that decomposes the roots of a
polynomial along a factorisation, for instance the roots of a monic integer polynomial along its
monic irreducible factors.

## Main results

* `Polynomial.Separable.roots_map_eq_map_numbering`: for a separable polynomial, a numbering of
  its root set enumerates its full root multiset after base change.
* `Polynomial.rootSet_mul`: the root set of a product of polynomials whose base changes to `E` are
  nonzero is the union of the root sets of the factors.
