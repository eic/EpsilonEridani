# Integrality from a monic quadratic relation

Mathlib's `IsIntegral.of_aeval_monic_of_isIntegral_coeff` takes a monic polynomial and asks for
each coefficient to be integral. Applying it to a quadratic means writing the polynomial out,
discharging the degree computation, and answering the coefficient obligation index by index — the
same half-dozen lines every time.

## Main results

* `IsIntegral.of_sq_add_mul_add_eq_zero`: if `y ^ 2 + b * y + c = 0` with `b` and `c` integral over
  `R`, then `y` is integral over `R`.

The relation is stated as an equation rather than through `Polynomial.aeval`, which is the form a
caller actually holds: a change-of-variables identity or a curve equation, rearranged by
`linear_combination`.

## Provenance

Extracted from `EpsilonEridani/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Integrality.lean`, where it was a private
helper for `WeierstrassCurve.isIntegral_y_of_equation_of_isIntegral_x` with a note that it was
"kept here rather than exported, since `isIntegral_y_of_equation_of_isIntegral_x` is its only
consumer". A second consumer now exists — the coordinates of a change of variables between integral
Weierstrass models — so the note no longer holds and the statement moves to where both can reach
it. The proof is unchanged; only the name is now `IsIntegral`-prefixed, since nothing about it is
about elliptic curves.

/-- **An element satisfying a monic quadratic relation with integral coefficients is integral.**
`y`, `b` and `c` live in an arbitrary commutative `R`-algebra `A`, and the relation is an equation
in `A` rather than a statement about `Polynomial.aeval`, so a caller supplies whatever identity it
already holds. -/
