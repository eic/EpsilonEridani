# Monic irreducible polynomials of a fixed degree

The monic irreducible polynomials of a given degree over a semiring `R` form a set depending
only on `R` and the degree. When `R` is finite that set is finite, because a monic polynomial of
degree `d` is determined by its lower coefficients: `Polynomial.monicEquivDegreeLT` matches such
polynomials with `Polynomial.degreeLT`, which `Polynomial.degreeLTEquiv` identifies with the
finite function space `Fin d → R`.

## Main definitions

* `Polynomial.monicIrreduciblesOfDegree`: the monic irreducible polynomials of degree `d`.

## Main results

* `Polynomial.mem_monicIrreduciblesOfDegree_iff`: the defining membership condition.
* `Polynomial.finite_monicIrreduciblesOfDegree`: over a finite coefficient ring there are
  finitely many.
* `EpsilonEridani.irreducible_map_intCast_of_natDegree_eq_three`: a monic integral cubic with no integral
  root is irreducible over `ℚ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.irreducible_map_intCast_of_natDegree_eq_four`: a monic integral quartic with no
  integral root and no monic integral quadratic factor is irreducible over `ℚ`.
