# The fifth cyclotomic polynomial over a field containing `√5`

Over any field `E` of characteristic different from `2` containing a square root `s` of `5`, the
fifth cyclotomic polynomial factors as

`Φ_5 = (X² − αX + 1) (X² − βX + 1)`, with `α = (s − 1)/2` and `β = (−s − 1)/2`,

because `α + β = −1` and `αβ = (1 − s²)/4 = −1`. In particular `Φ_5` is not irreducible over `E`.

The hypothesis `2 ≠ 0` is genuinely needed: over `ZMod 2` one has `1 ^ 2 = 5` while `Φ_5` is
irreducible, since `2` has order `4` modulo `5`.

## Main results

* `Polynomial.cyclotomic_five_eq_mul_of_sq_eq_five`: the explicit factorisation.
* `Polynomial.not_irreducible_cyclotomic_five_of_sq_eq_five`: `Φ_5` is reducible over `E`.

## References

Over `K = ℚ(√5)` the fifth cyclotomic polynomial is reducible. This is why irreducibility of
`Φ_q` over a general base needs a hypothesis such as unramifiedness: `5` ramifies in `ℚ(√5)`.

That `ℚ(√5)` is the quadratic subfield of `ℚ(ζ_5)` is Sharifi, *Algebraic Number Theory*,
Lemma 3.2.2.

/-- **`Φ_5` is reducible over a field containing `√5`.**

This bounds no degree by itself: `E` may already contain `ζ_5`, in which case `Φ_5` splits into
linear factors. What the statement gives is reducibility, and hence that `Φ_5` is *not* the
minimal polynomial of a primitive fifth root of unity over `E`. -/
