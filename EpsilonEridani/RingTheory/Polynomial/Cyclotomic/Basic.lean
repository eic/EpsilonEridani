# Basic identities for cyclotomic polynomials

`Polynomial.cyclotomic_five` gives the fifth cyclotomic polynomial as the finite geometric
sum `X⁴ + X³ + X² + X + 1` over any ring.

Mathlib defines `Φ₅` abstractly, as a product over primitive roots of unity, and only unfolds it
to a sum through `Polynomial.cyclotomic_prime`. Recording the expanded form once, as a `simp`
lemma over an arbitrary ring, lets explicit factorisation and Galois-group computations work with
the concrete coefficients directly. It is used for the factorisation of `Φ₅` over a field
containing `√5` in `EpsilonEridani.RingTheory.Polynomial.Cyclotomic.SqrtFive`, and to identify
`X⁴ + X³ + X² + X + 1` with `Φ₅` in the worked quartic examples in
`EpsilonEridani.FieldTheory.GaloisGroups.Quartic.Examples`, where its Galois group over `ℚ` is
computed as `(ℤ/5)ˣ`.
