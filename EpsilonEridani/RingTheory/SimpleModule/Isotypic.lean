# A semisimple module is the direct sum of its isotypic components

Mathlib shows that the isotypic components of a module are independent
(`sSupIndep_isotypicComponents`) and, for a semisimple module, span it
(`sSup_isotypicComponents`); it reads off the consequence for endomorphisms
(`IsSemisimpleModule.endAlgEquiv`). This file records the consequence for the module itself: a
semisimple module is the internal direct sum of its isotypic components. When there are finitely
many components, for instance when the module is Noetherian, composing with
`DFinsupp.linearEquivFunOnFintype` presents it as their product.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsSemisimpleModule.linearEquivIsotypicComponents`: a semisimple module is linearly
  equivalent to the direct sum of its isotypic components.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.IsSemisimpleModule.linearEquivIsotypicComponents_apply_coe` and
  `EpsilonEridani.IsSemisimpleModule.linearEquivIsotypicComponents_symm_single`: the equivalence and its
  inverse on a single isotypic component.
