# Complements on `AdjoinRoot`

Mathlib's `AdjoinRoot.map` sends a ring homomorphism `f : R →+* S`, together with a divisibility
`q ∣ p.map f`, to a ring homomorphism `AdjoinRoot p →+* AdjoinRoot q`. It records the action on
`AdjoinRoot.of` and on `AdjoinRoot.root` (`map_of`, `map_root`) but not the action on the class of
a general polynomial, and says nothing about surjectivity. Both are added here, together with the
description of the `R`-linear endomorphisms of `AdjoinRoot g`, for `g` monic, that commute with
multiplication by the root.

## Main results

* `AdjoinRoot.map_mk`: the map sends the class of `x` to the class of `x.map f`. Mathlib states
  this only in the specialised form `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.map_mk`. Marked
  `@[simp]`, like its neighbours `AdjoinRoot.map_of` and `AdjoinRoot.map_root`.
* `AdjoinRoot.map_surjective`: the map is surjective when `f` is.
* `AdjoinRoot.exists_degree_lt_mk_eq`, `AdjoinRoot.mk_eq_mk_iff_of_degree_lt`: for a monic
  relator, every class is represented by a polynomial of degree less than that of the relator, and
  that representative is unique. Mathlib has division with remainder by a monic polynomial but
  does not record what it says about `AdjoinRoot`.
* `AdjoinRoot.eq_mulRight_of_root_mul`: an `R`-linear endomorphism of `AdjoinRoot g`, for `g`
  monic, that commutes with multiplication by the root is multiplication by its value at `1`. Its
  consumers are the truncated polynomial algebras of
  `EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.OneLoop.FiniteRepType` and
  `EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Kronecker.FiniteRepType`, whose endomorphism algebras it
  pins down, but nothing beyond monicity of the relator enters the proof.

Stated over arbitrary commutative rings.

This is consumed by `EpsilonEridani/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Affine/CoordinateRingMap.lean`, which
specialises it to the coordinate ring of a Weierstrass curve for the Hasse strand of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, Layer 3.

## Provenance

The surjectivity argument — lift a class to a polynomial, then lift that polynomial along `f` — is
adapted from the AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, pinned by
that roadmap at `dev/hasse-weil @ 513e83879e2f`),
`HasseWeil/WeilPairing/FrobeniusFunctionFieldEquiv.lean`, declaration `coordRingMap_bijective`.
There it is carried out for the coordinate ring of a Weierstrass curve and only for a base ring
*equivalence*; here it is stated for `AdjoinRoot.map` along any surjective base homomorphism, with
`map_mk` — which the source does not isolate — extracted as the step that makes it routine.
`AdjoinRoot.exists_degree_lt_mk_eq` and `AdjoinRoot.mk_eq_mk_iff_of_degree_lt` are adapted from
Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` project (`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`,
Apache-2.0, pinned by `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` at `66889eada51a`),
`EllipticCurves/Mathlib/Basic.lean`. There the reduction step the first one uses is a separate
lemma; here that step is Mathlib's `AdjoinRoot.mk_leftInverse`. The source proves the second from a
named helper `eq_zero_of_monic_dvd_of_degree_lt`; that helper is a one-line composition of
Mathlib's `Polynomial.modByMonic_eq_self_iff` and `Polynomial.modByMonic_eq_zero_iff_dvd`, so it is
inlined here rather than re-declared. They are harvested here rather than in the file that consumes
them because nothing about elliptic curves enters either statement.
