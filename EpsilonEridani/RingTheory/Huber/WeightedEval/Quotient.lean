# The map induced on a quotient of `A⟨X⟩_T`

Wedhorn's Example 6.38(a) presents a rational localisation `A⟨T/s⟩` as a quotient `C ⧸ 𝔞` of a
ring of restricted power series, and one of the two maps that identify them goes *out* of that
quotient. This file supplies it: an evaluation `A⟨X⟩_T →+* B` that kills an ideal `𝔞` factors
through `A⟨X⟩_T ⧸ 𝔞`, and the factorisation is again continuous.

The same factorisation exists one level up, for morphisms of Huber pairs
(`EpsilonEridani.Huber.Pair.Hom.quotientLift`). The two differ in what the objects carry: a Huber pair
comes with a ring of integral elements and its morphisms must preserve it, whereas Wedhorn's
Proposition 5.50 — the universal property being transported here — speaks about ring
homomorphisms of topological rings and asks for no such structure. Use the pair-level version when
the source and target are Huber pairs, and this one otherwise.

## What is *not* assumed, and why it is worth saying

`𝔞` is **not** assumed closed. Closedness of `𝔞` is what makes `C ⧸ 𝔞` separated
(`Ideal.Quotient.instT1Space`), and Example 6.38 does need it — but for the *other* direction,
where `C ⧸ 𝔞` is the complete Hausdorff nonarchimedean **target** of the universal property of
`A⟨T/s⟩`, alongside `Ideal.Quotient.instNonarchimedeanRing`. For a map *out* of `C ⧸ 𝔞` none of
that is used: the quotient topology exists for any ideal, and it is all the argument needs. The
hypothesis is therefore omitted rather than carried, and a consumer that also needs `C ⧸ 𝔞` to be
a well-behaved target should assume closedness alongside.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.weightedEvalQuotientHom`: the induced ring homomorphism `A⟨X⟩_T ⧸ 𝔞 →+* B`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.weightedEvalQuotientHom_comp_mk`: it is a factorisation of
  `EpsilonEridani.Huber.weightedEvalHom` through the quotient map. This is the property that characterises
  the induced map, and it determines its values on the images of the constants and of the
  variables.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.continuous_weightedEvalQuotientHom`: the induced map is continuous.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_quotient_weightedRestrictedSubring`: it is the
  *only* continuous homomorphism out of `A⟨X⟩_T ⧸ 𝔞` with the prescribed values on the images of
  the constants and the variables — the universal property of `A⟨X⟩_T` read on the quotient.

* [Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*][wedhorn_adic], Example 6.38(a), and Proposition 5.50 for the
  universal property this factors.

universal property — `φ` continuous at zero and values `b` making the weighted monomials bounded
— together with an ideal `𝔞` contained in the kernel of the resulting evaluation, this is the
homomorphism `A⟨X⟩_T ⧸ 𝔞 →+* B` through which that evaluation factors.

The witness is `EpsilonEridani.Huber.weightedEvalQuotientHom`, so a consumer holding a continuous
