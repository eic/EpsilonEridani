# Bounded and power-bounded elements of normed rings

In a seminormed ring the balls about zero form a neighbourhood basis of zero, so norm-bounded
sets are bounded in the sense of `EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsBounded`. For a normed division ring
this identifies the power-bounded elements with the closed unit ball and shows that the ring is
uniform; for instance `ℚ_[p]` is uniform, and its power-bounded elements are those of `ℤ_[p]`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.isBounded_closedBall_zero`: closed balls about zero are bounded.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.isPowerBounded_iff_norm_le_one`: in a normed division ring an element is
  power-bounded exactly when its norm is at most one.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsUniform.of_normedDivisionRing`: normed division rings are uniform.
