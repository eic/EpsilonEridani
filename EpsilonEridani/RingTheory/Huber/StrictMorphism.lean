# Strict morphisms out of a finite module over a Tate ring

Let `A` be a complete Hausdorff Tate ring, let `M` be a finite `A`-module and let `N` be a
noetherian `A`-module, each carrying a complete Hausdorff first-countable topology making it a
topological `A`-module. This file proves that every linear map `M →ₗ[A] N` is strict: it is open
onto its image, and in particular continuous, with no continuity hypothesis imposed on it. This is
[Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*][wedhorn_adic], Proposition 6.18(2).

Wedhorn states the target side as a finite module over a noetherian ring; that case is the
instance `isNoetherian_of_isNoetherianRing_of_finite` of the noetherian target asked for here.

The strictness of a morphism is what makes a presentation of a module by finite free modules a
topological presentation, so this is the result that lets finite modules over a noetherian Tate
ring — where finiteness of the target already gives the noetherian hypothesis — be glued and
localised topologically. The open mapping theorem it rests on is Henkel's, credited in
`EpsilonEridani.RingTheory.Huber.OpenMapping`.

## Main result

* `LinearMap.isStrictMap_of_module_finite`: a linear map from a finite module to a noetherian
  module, over a complete Hausdorff Tate ring, is strict.

## References

* [T. Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*][wedhorn_adic], Proposition 6.18(2).

/-- **A linear map from a finite module to a noetherian module over a complete Tate ring is
strict** ([Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*][wedhorn_adic], Proposition 6.18(2)): it is open onto its image.

No continuity hypothesis is imposed on `f`; continuity is part of the conclusion, obtained from
it by `Topology.IsStrictMap.continuous`. -/
