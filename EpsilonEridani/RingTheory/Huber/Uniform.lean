# Uniform Huber rings

A topological ring `A` is *uniform* when its set `A°` of power-bounded elements is bounded
(Hansen–Kedlaya, Definition 2.3). Uniformity is the hypothesis of the Buzzard–Verberkmoes
sheafiness criterion: if every rational localisation of a complete Tate ring is uniform, then the
structure presheaf of its adic spectrum is a sheaf, with no noetherian hypothesis.

For a Huber ring, `A°` is always an open subring, so by Wedhorn's Lemma 6.2 uniformity says
exactly that `A°` is itself a ring of definition. In a uniform Tate ring every nilpotent element
lies in the closure of zero, so a Hausdorff uniform Tate ring is reduced: a Hausdorff Tate ring with
a nonzero nilpotent element is not uniform.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsUniform`: the power-bounded elements form a bounded set.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.isUniform_iff_exists_pairOfDefinition_ringOfDefinition_eq`: a Huber ring is
  uniform exactly when `A°` is a ring of definition.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.isUniform_iff_of_ringEquiv`: uniformity transports along topological ring
  isomorphisms.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsUniform.nilradical_le_closure_bot`: in a uniform Tate ring every nilpotent
  element lies in the closure of zero.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsUniform.isReduced`: a Hausdorff uniform Tate ring is reduced.

Discrete rings are uniform (`EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsUniform.of_discreteTopology`), and so are normed
division rings, by `EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsUniform.of_normedDivisionRing` in
`EpsilonEridani.RingTheory.Huber.Normed`.
