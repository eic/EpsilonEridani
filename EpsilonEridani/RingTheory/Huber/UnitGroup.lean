# The unit group of a complete Huber ring is open, and proper ideals stay proper

This is the first half of Wedhorn's Proposition 7.51, whose statement is "*then `𝔪` is closed
and there exists `v ∈ Spa A` with `supp v = 𝔪`*". Only the closedness conjunct is proved here;
the existence conjunct needs nonemptiness of the adic spectrum (Wedhorn Proposition 7.49) and is
carried out in `EpsilonEridani/AlgebraicGeometry/AdicSpace/Spa/Support.lean`, which consumes the density
statements below.

The argument is Wedhorn's. The topologically nilpotent elements of a Huber ring form an open set
(`EpsilonEridani.Huber.isOpen_setOf_isTopologicallyNilpotent`), and completeness makes `1 + A°°` consist
of units (`IsTopologicallyNilpotent.isUnit_one_add`). Around a unit `u` the set of `x` with
`u⁻¹x - 1` topologically nilpotent is then an open neighbourhood of `u` made of units, so the unit
group is open. Closedness of maximal ideals is then immediate from
`Ideal.isClosed_of_isMaximal_of_isOpen_isUnit`, which holds over any topological ring, and so is
the fact that a proper ideal is never dense — a statement that survives the passage to `A ⧸ J`,
where it says that the separated quotient of `A ⧸ J` is nonzero.

## Why this does not assume a linear topology

`EpsilonEridani.Topology.Algebra.Nonarchimedean.MaximalIdeals` proves the *openness* of maximal ideals, and
everything in it carries `[IsLinearTopology A A]` — a basis of neighbourhoods of zero consisting of
ideals. That is not incidental. An open ideal of a Tate ring is the whole ring
(`EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsTateRing.isOpen_iff_eq_top`), so no *proper* ideal of a nonzero Tate ring is open
and the results in that file are adic-only; over `ℚ_p`, `IsTopologicallyNilpotent.mem_of_isMaximal`
would otherwise put `p` in the zero ideal.

Closedness carries no such hypothesis, so it is available for every complete Huber ring, Tate ones
included. Getting there does take a different argument from the linear-topology one — see the
Provenance section — but the resulting statements are hypothesis-free, which is what makes this the
form of Proposition 7.51 that survives the Tate case.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.isOpen_setOf_isUnit` : the unit group of a complete Huber ring is open.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.isClosed_of_isMaximal` : **Wedhorn Proposition 7.51, closedness half** — every
  maximal ideal of a complete Huber ring is closed.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.one_notMem_closure_zero_quotient_of_ne_top` : the separated quotient of `A ⧸ J`
  is nonzero for every proper `J`.

## Provenance

Adapted from AINTLIB (see References), section `OpenUnits` of the source file, where the statement
is `isOpen_units_of_isOpen_topologicallyNilpotent`. (That file's other half, the closedness
argument, is carried over in `EpsilonEridani.Topology.Algebra.Ring.MaximalIdeals`.)

The openness argument is **not** taken over verbatim, and the difference is the point of this
file. AINTLIB covers a unit `u` by the additive translate `u + A°°`, which forces it to rewrite
`u + a = u * (1 + u⁻¹a)` and to know that `u⁻¹a` is again topologically nilpotent — that is
`IsTopologicallyNilpotent.mul_left`, which Mathlib states only under `[IsLinearTopology R R]`, so
AINTLIB carries that hypothesis. It is not removable there: in a Tate ring `A°°` is not an ideal,
and `ℚ_p` is a counterexample, with `p` topologically nilpotent but `p⁻² * p = p⁻¹` not. The
hypothesis is load bearing for that route, not an oversight.

The proof here covers `u` by the *multiplicative* neighbourhood `{x : u⁻¹x - 1 ∈ A°°}` instead. That
needs only continuity of `x ↦ u⁻¹x - 1` and the geometric series, never that `A°°` absorbs
multiplication, so it holds with no linear-topology hypothesis at all and therefore applies to Tate
rings. Separately, this repository already has
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.isOpen_setOf_isTopologicallyNilpotent`, so AINTLIB's `A°°`-openness hypothesis is
discharged rather than carried, and the Huber-level statements need no side conditions.
