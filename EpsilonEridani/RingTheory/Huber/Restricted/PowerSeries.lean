# Restricted Power Series

This file defines restricted power series `A⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`, following Wedhorn's *Adic Spaces*,
where the convergent/restricted power series ring is (5.6.1) in §5.6.

## Main definitions

* `IsRestricted`: A power series is **restricted** if its coefficients
  converge to `0` along the cofinite filter on multi-indices. The coefficients are asked only for
  a `0` and a topology, so the same predicate serves ring and module coefficients.
* `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubring k A`: The subring of restricted power series in `k`
  variables over `A`, denoted `A⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`.
* `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodule k A M`: the `A`-submodule of restricted power series with
  coefficients in a topological `A`-module `M`, denoted `M⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`. This is the object
  Wedhorn's Remark 8.29 compares with `M ⊗[A] A⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`. It *is* Mathlib's
  `Filter.zeroAtFilterSubmodule` at the cofinite filter, under the Huber-theoretic name.
* `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubringVal`: the inclusion `A⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩ → MvPowerSeries (Fin k) A` as
  an `A`-algebra map. `A⟨T⟩` is a `Subring` carrying an `Algebra A` instance rather than a
  `Subalgebra`, so `Subalgebra.val` does not apply.
* `isRestricted_of_hasFiniteSupport`: the introduction rule at module coefficients — finitely many
  nonzero coefficients suffice.
* `isRestricted_pi_iff`: restrictedness of a series with coefficients in a product is
  componentwise.
* `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubringLinearEquiv`: at `M = A` the subring and the submodule of
  restricted series are `A`-linearly isomorphic.
* `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap`: `M ↦ M⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩` is functorial in zero-continuous
  `A`-linear maps, with `IsRestricted.map` at the predicate level and the two functor laws.
* `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap_surjective`: that functor preserves **open** surjections
  out of a module with a countable neighbourhood basis at `0` — the lifted coefficients can then
  be chosen to still tend to `0`, which lifting them one at a time does not give. This is what
  lets Wedhorn's Remark 8.29 descend from a presentation.
* `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap_eq_zero_iff` and
  `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap_injective`: the kernel of the induced map is detected
  coefficientwise, so the functor preserves injectivity. Together with
  `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap_surjective` these are the exactness inputs Remark 8.29
  needs at the two ends.
* `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap_range_eq_ker`: and the input it needs **in the middle** —
  for `range u = ker p` with `u` open onto its image, the induced row is exact at `N⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`.
  With the two above, Remark 8.29's row is exact everywhere.
* `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodule_ext`: coefficientwise agreement is equality in `M⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`
  — the elimination rule `MvPowerSeries.ext` cannot supply at module coefficients.
* `coeff_coe_smul_restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubring`: the scalar action on `A⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩` is
  coefficientwise multiplication — the subring's action is `Algebra.smul_def`, not pointwise.
* `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodulePiEquiv`: that criterion as an `A`-linear equivalence,
  `(∏ i, M i)⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩ ≃ₗ[A] ∏ i, M i⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`.

## Provenance

This module is a port of AINTLIB's `projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/RestrictedPowerSeries.lean`,
the roadmap's designated prior formalisation of this material. Three groups, because the port and
this PR did different things to different declarations.

**AINTLIB's in definition, statement and proof.** `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubring`,
`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubring.instAlgebra`, `IsRestricted.finite_coeff_notMem`, the private
helpers `finite_shift_bad_set` and `coeff_mul_mem_of_forall_mem`, and `IsRestricted.mul` — the
convolution argument this file exists for. That convolution argument is AINTLIB's; what differs
here is three call sites renamed to `isRestricted_iff_coeff`, and the choice of absorbing
neighbourhood, which now comes from Mathlib's `exists_mem_nhds_zero_mul_subset` on the left and
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.isBounded_finite` on the right, in place of AINTLIB's inline `Aᵐᵒᵖ` transport.

**AINTLIB's in statement, with proofs rewritten here.** Five: `isRestricted_zero`,
`IsRestricted.add` and `IsRestricted.neg`, which now delegate to Mathlib's `Filter.ZeroAtFilter`
API instead of reproving convergence; and `isRestricted_one` and `isRestricted_algebraMap`, which
were near-identical `tendsto_nhds`/`mem_cofinite` arguments and are now special cases of
`isRestricted_of_hasFiniteSupport`. `IsRestricted` itself is AINTLIB's statement at weaker
coefficient binders — `[Zero]` and a topology, where the original asked for a semiring.

**Original here.** `isRestricted_monomial`, `isRestricted_of_hasFiniteSupport`,
`IsRestricted.smul`, `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodule`, `mem_restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodule`,
`isRestricted_pi_iff`, `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodulePiEquiv` and
`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubringLinearEquiv`, each with its computation lemmas, together with
`IsRestricted.map`, `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap` with its laws,
`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap_surjective`,
`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap_eq_zero_iff` and
`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap_injective`, and
`coeff_coe_smul_restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubring`.

**None of those has an AINTLIB counterpart**, for three different reasons.

`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap_surjective` has none for the same reason as the rest of the
induced-map material: AINTLIB states restricted series over a coefficient *ring* only, so it has no
induced map at module coefficients and a fortiori no surjectivity statement about one. Wedhorn
Remark 8.29 is credited for the mathematics; the lifting construction it delegates to
(`EpsilonEridani.exists_lift_tendsto_cofinite_nhds`) is original here too.
`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap_eq_zero_iff` and
`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap_injective` are the same statement at the other end of the
exactness, and have no counterpart there for the same reason.

The two product statements — `isRestricted_pi_iff` and `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodulePiEquiv` —
have none because the source states restrictedness only for a single coefficient module and never
for a product, so neither the criterion nor the equivalence packaging it appears there. Of those
two, `isRestricted_pi_iff`'s content is Mathlib's `tendsto_pi_nhds`, so what is original in it is
the statement rather than the argument, while the equivalence is original in both.

`IsRestricted.map`, `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap` and its laws have none because the
source states restricted series only over a coefficient *ring*: there is no module argument there
to be functorial in, so no map to credit. The general filter content of `IsRestricted.map` is
`Filter.ZeroAtFilter.comp`, which this repo supplies.

`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubringLinearEquiv` has none because the source never introduces the
submodule at all, so the subring is the only object it has to identify. The same holds of
`coeff_coe_smul_restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubring`, which computes an action the source never
states.

**AINTLIB's mathematics, generalised in statement and rebuilt on this file's API.**
`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap_range_eq_ker` is AINTLIB's `muMap_middle_exact`
(`Adic spaces/TateAlgebra.lean:1855`), Wedhorn's own middle-exactness step, and the argument is
that one: corestrict `u` to its image, lift the coefficients of a series killed by `p` along the
corestriction, compose back. Three things differ. The source fixes the row to `Aⁿ → Aᵐ → M` and
carries Wedhorn's bundle — `[CompleteSpace A] [IsTateRing A] [IsNoetherianRing A]` — so as to
*derive* strictness of `u` from its own `wedhorn_6_18_open_onto_image`; the row here is between
arbitrary topological modules with strictness hypothesised, so none of that bundle appears. The
source works at ring coefficients through its own `restrictedModule` and lifts with
`restrictedModule_map_surjective`; both come from this file's module-coefficient functor here.
And the continuity of the action on `↥(range u)`, which the source establishes inline, is
`Submodule.continuousConstSMul`.

The name `isRestricted_iff` needs care: the port introduced it for the `coeff`-form unfolding
lemma, which is now `isRestricted_iff_coeff`. The statement the name carries here — unfolding
through `Filter.ZeroAtFilter` at coefficients asking only for a `0` and a topology — is new.

That originality claim was checked against **both** AINTLIB sources the roadmap designates for
this material, not only `RestrictedPowerSeries.lean`. AINTLIB's `TateAlgebra.lean`,
`TateAlgebraTopology.lean` and `TateAlgebraWedhorn.lean` build `TateAlgebra A` for a *ring* `A`
(`[CommRing A] [TopologicalSpace A] [NonarchimedeanRing A]`) throughout; their `Submodule`
occurrences are ideals of that ring viewed as submodules, not coefficients in a module. There is
no `M⟨X⟩` there, and §0.5's "restricted series with coefficients in a complete topological module"
has no AINTLIB counterpart to credit.

The port additionally moves the declarations into the `EpsilonEridani.Huber` namespace, opts into the
Lean module system with the definition bodies unexposed — hence the added `isRestricted_iff_coeff`,
`mem_restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubring` and `coe_algebraMap_restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubring` — tracks
the Mathlib rename of `Set.mem_setOf_eq` to
`Set.mem_ofPred_eq`, renames the predicate from AINTLIB's `IsRestrictedAdic` (nothing here is
adic), and drops hypotheses that the individual proofs never used.

This is *not* Mathlib's `MvPowerSeries.IsRestricted`, which is stated over a normed ring and
relative to a polyradius `c : σ → ℝ`, asking that `‖coeff t f‖ * ∏ i, c i ^ t i` tend to `0` along
the cofinite filter. The two conditions agree over a normed ring at `c = 1`, but neither is more
general: Mathlib's varies the radius, while `IsRestricted` here needs no norm — indeed no
multiplication, asking the coefficients for nothing beyond a `0` and a topology. It is the
norm-free form that Huber theory requires: Huber ring topologies are defined using an ideal of
definition and need not be induced by a norm. The nonarchimedean hypothesis enters only for
closure under multiplication, and hence for the subring but not for the submodule.

## Implementation notes

The restricted power series ring is defined as a subring of `MvPowerSeries (Fin k) A`
(the formal power series ring), cut out by the condition that coefficients tend to `0`.
This is the canonical concrete definition. `M⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩` is cut out of
`MvPowerSeries (Fin k) M` by the same condition, as an `A`-submodule.

**`IsRestricted` is Mathlib's `Filter.ZeroAtFilter` at the cofinite filter**, applied to the
coefficient function — see `isRestricted_iff`, which is `Iff.rfl`. The closure
lemmas delegate to `zero_zeroAtFilter` and `ZeroAtFilter.add`/`.neg`/`.smul`, and
`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodule` *is* `Filter.zeroAtFilterSubmodule` at that filter rather than
a reconstruction of it. The Huber-specific names are kept because `M⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩` is the object the
roadmap names, but no closure property is proved here that Mathlib already has.

`isRestricted_iff` unfolds the predicate through `Filter.ZeroAtFilter`, which is the form the
delegations use and what module coefficients admit; `isRestricted_iff_coeff` unfolds it through
`MvPowerSeries.coeff`, the accessor to prefer wherever the coefficients form a semiring. The two
agree definitionally, because `coeff` is projection.

`isRestricted_of_hasFiniteSupport` delegates separately, through `tendsto_cofinite_pure_iff`, and
`isRestricted_one` and `isRestricted_algebraMap` are its special cases at `1` and at a constant.

The closure of the restricted power series under multiplication (convolution) requires
that `A` is a topological ring. The proof that the convolution of two sequences tending
to `0` also tends to `0` uses the nonarchimedean property to ensure that
arbitrary finite sums of elements in an open additive subgroup remain in the subgroup.

/-! ### Restricted power series -/

/-- An element `f` of the multivariate power series ring `M⦃X₁, …, Xₖ⦄` is **restricted**
if its coefficients converge to `0` along the cofinite filter on multi-indices. That is,
for every open neighborhood `U` of `0` in `M`, all but finitely many coefficients of `f`
lie in `U`. This is the defining property of elements of `M⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`, and of
`A⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩` in the case of ring coefficients.

The coefficients need carry no algebraic structure beyond a distinguished `0`: the condition is
about a family of points converging in `M`. Stronger binders appear below wherever the *statement*
names an operation, because that is where Mathlib's `MvPowerSeries` instances put the floor —
`f + g` needs `[AddMonoid M]` and `c • f` needs `[Module R M]` for the expression to be
well-formed at all, not because the convergence argument needs them. The module coefficients used
for `M⟨X⟩` are not a semiring, which is why the predicate itself must not ask for one.

See Wedhorn, (5.6.1) and §6.7. -/

The two sides are **equivalent, not identical** — unlike `isRestricted_iff_coeff` and
`mem_restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodule`, whose `(Iff.rfl)` proofs mark a genuine defeq, this one
is not a definitional unfolding.

Deliberately **not** `@[simp]`: the right-hand side is a componentwise form that no other lemma in

a dead end for anything beyond the lemmas that already close them. -/

/-- A zero-preserving map that is continuous **at `0`** pushes restricted series forward: `φ ∘ f`
is restricted whenever `f` is. Restrictedness is convergence of the coefficients to `0` along
`cofinite`, so only the behaviour of `φ` at `0` is involved; global continuity is not needed.

`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap` takes the same hypothesis, and not the stronger one, because
they do **not** coincide here: continuity at `0` upgrades to global continuity for a linear map
only when the topology is translation-invariant, and these modules carry `ContinuousAdd` rather
than `IsTopologicalAddGroup`. A caller holding `Continuous φ` passes `hφ.continuousAt`.

The `show` fixes the elaboration of the coefficient function as a `MvPowerSeries`: that type is a
plain `def` for `(Fin k →₀ ℕ) → N`, so without the ascription the lambda elaborates at the bare
function type and `IsRestricted` does not apply to it. -/

/-- **A strict surjection stays surjective on restricted series.** If `φ` is a surjective
`A`-linear map which is continuous at `0` and carries the neighbourhoods of `0` onto
neighbourhoods of `0`, and `M` has a countable neighbourhood basis at `0`, then every restricted
series with coefficients in `N` is the image of one with coefficients in `M`.

Countability of `𝓝 (0 : M)` is what supplies the antitone basis the lifted coefficients are drawn
from, so it is a genuine restriction on `M` and not bookkeeping.

Surjectivity coefficientwise is immediate from surjectivity of `φ`; what is not, and what openness
supplies, is that the chosen preimages can be made to *converge*. Lifting each coefficient
independently can leave the lifts spread out even though the original coefficients tend to `0`, in
which case the lift is a power series but not a restricted one. See
`EpsilonEridani.exists_lift_tendsto_cofinite_nhds`, where the choice is made.

This is the step Wedhorn's Remark 8.29 needs in order to descend from a presentation: applied to a
presentation `Aᵐ ↠ M`, together with the finite free case, it is what makes the comparison map for
a finitely generated `M` surjective.

The hypothesis is the filter inequality the proof actually consumes rather than `IsOpenMap φ`,
which is strictly stronger here: these modules carry `ContinuousAdd` rather than
`IsTopologicalAddGroup`, so without translation invariance global openness does not follow from
openness at `0`. A caller holding `IsOpenMap φ` — over a Tate ring, from
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsTateRing.isOpenMap` — passes `map_zero φ ▸ hopen.nhds_le 0`. -/

`M⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩ → N⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩ → P⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩` is exact at the middle — provided `u` is **strict**,
carrying the neighbourhoods of `0` onto neighbourhoods of `0` in its image, and `M` has a
countable neighbourhood basis at `0`.

This is the middle-exactness step of Wedhorn's Remark 8.29: applied to a presentation
`Aⁿ →u Aᵐ →p M → 0` it makes the restricted-series row exact at `Aᵐ⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩`, which is the
input the injective half of that remark runs a diagram chase against.
`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap_injective` and
`restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap_surjective` are the same statement at the two ends.

Strictness does not follow from continuity and is not derived here. It is Wedhorn's
Proposition 6.18(2) that supplies it in the setting Remark 8.29 is stated in — over a complete
noetherian Tate ring a linear map of finitely generated modules is open onto its image — and that
derivation needs hypotheses this file does not carry. So strictness is taken as a hypothesis, in
the filter-inequality form `restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmoduleMap_surjective` also takes it: a
caller holding `h : IsOpenMap u.rangeRestrict` passes `map_zero _ ▸ h.nhds_le 0`.

Only `u` need be strict. Nothing is asked of `p` beyond continuity at `0`, and nothing at all of
`N` or `P` beyond what `N⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩` and `P⟨T₁, …, Tₖ⟩` need to exist: exactness at the middle
lifts the coefficients of a series killed by `p` along `u`, and the countable basis that lifting
consumes is a property of the source.

Stated as the equality of submodules rather than through Mathlib's `Function.Exact`, whose file
this one does not import; `LinearMap.exact_iff` converts in either direction where it is wanted. -/
