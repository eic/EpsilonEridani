# Restricted series lift along an open surjection

A continuous **open** surjection `φ : A → B` of nonarchimedean rings whose source has countably
generated `𝓝 0` induces a surjection of restricted power-series *rings* — the trivial-weight
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.weightedRestrictedSubring`, before completion — coefficientwise.

Openness is the hypothesis that matters. Surjectivity of `φ` alone lifts each coefficient of a
restricted series separately, but the preimages so chosen need not tend to zero, and then the lift
is a power series and not a restricted one. Openness is what lets the preimages be drawn from a
shrinking family of neighbourhoods; `EpsilonEridani.exists_lift_tendsto_cofinite_nhds` is where that
choice is made, and this file is its transcription into the weighted language, at the trivial
weight family where restrictedness *is* convergence to zero
(`EpsilonEridani.Huber.isWeightedRestricted_one_weight_iff`).

**Countable generation of `𝓝 (0 : A)` is a hypothesis of both results here**, not a background
assumption: it is what supplies the shrinking family the lifted coefficients are drawn from, and a
general `NonarchimedeanRing` need not have it. It is not restrictive in the intended application —
a Huber ring satisfies it, by `EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsHuberRing.isCountablyGenerated_nhds_zero`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.weightedMap_one_weight_surjective`, with
  `IsOpenQuotientMap.weightedMap_one_weight_surjective` the form taking the bundled structure —
  in that namespace so `hq.weightedMap_one_weight_surjective` works.

/-- **A continuous surjection carrying neighbourhoods of zero onto neighbourhoods of zero stays
surjective on restricted series**, provided `𝓝 (0 : A)` is countably generated. Every restricted
series over `B` is then the image of one over `A`.

The hypothesis is stated as the filter inequality the proof consumes. Alongside the surjectivity
assumed here it is the filter-level formulation of `IsOpenMap φ`, not a weakening of it — for a
surjective continuous additive map the two say the same thing, since openness of a group
homomorphism is decided at zero. `IsOpenQuotientMap.weightedMap_one_weight_surjective` is the form
for a caller holding the bundled open-quotient structure.

This is a step towards what Wedhorn's Proposition & Definition 6.36(ii) needs, not the whole of
it. `EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType` asks for an open quotient map whose domain
is `EpsilonEridani.Huber.restrictedMvPowerSeriesCompletion k A` — the *completion* `A⟨X₁,…,Xₖ⟩` at the
trivial weight — whereas the surjection here is one level below, between the restricted subrings
themselves. Passing from this to an open quotient out of the completion is a separate step.

`EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsTopologicallyFiniteType` is the weaker notion, and what weakens it is the
*weight family*, not completion: it allows an arbitrary finite family `T` in place of the trivial
one. Both notions take their quotient out of a completion. -/

/-- **The open-quotient form of `EpsilonEridani.Huber.weightedMap_one_weight_surjective`**, for a caller
holding the bundled `IsOpenQuotientMap φ`.

That is the interface finite-type presentations come in — `EpsilonEridani.Huber`
`.IsStrictlyTopologicallyFiniteType` produces one — so it is the form a consumer actually has,
and it bundles exactly the continuity, surjectivity and openness the filter-level theorem needs. -/
