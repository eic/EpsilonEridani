# First countability of the weighted restricted series ring

`EpsilonEridani.Huber.weightedRestrictedSubring` carries the topology whose neighbourhoods of zero are
the `U⟨X⟩` for `U` an open additive subgroup of the coefficient ring `A`
(`EpsilonEridani.Huber.hasBasis_nhds_zero_weightedTopology`). That basis is indexed by *all* of
`OpenAddSubgroup A`, so it is not countable as it stands; what makes `𝓝 0` countably generated is
that a countable *cofinal* subfamily suffices, and a nonarchimedean `A` whose own `𝓝 0` is
countably generated supplies one.

This matters because `FirstCountableTopology` is the class Mathlib's own instances are keyed on —
notably the completeness of a quotient by a subgroup (Bourbaki IX.3.1 Proposition 4), which the
theory of rational localisations consumes. With the instance below in scope,
`FirstCountableTopology (weightedRestrictedSubring T hT)` is found by typeclass resolution alone,
through `EpsilonEridani.SeparatelyContinuousAdd.toFirstCountableTopology`; no separate declaration is
needed and none is given.

The hypothesis `[(𝓝 (0 : A)).IsCountablyGenerated]` is not restrictive in the intended
application: a Huber ring satisfies it, by
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsHuberRing.isCountablyGenerated_nhds_zero`.
