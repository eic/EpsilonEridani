# Continuity of a valuation on a Huber ring

On a Huber ring the neighbourhood filter of `0` has a concrete basis — the images of the powers
`Iⁿ` of an ideal of definition (`EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.hasBasis_nhds_zero`). Continuity
of a valuation, which is openness of the sets `{a | v a < v b}`, can therefore be tested against
that basis instead of against the topology: **`v` is continuous exactly when each of those sets
swallows some `Iⁿ`.**

That replaces a quantifier over open sets by one over a single natural number, and it is the
form Wedhorn's §7.2 arguments actually use — his proof of Theorem 7.10 produces continuity by
exhibiting, for a given `γ`, an `n` with `v < γ` on `Iⁿ⁺¹`.

## The codomain is a monoid, so `Valuation.ltAddSubgroup` is unavailable

Mathlib's `Valuation.ltAddSubgroup` packages a sublevel set as an additive subgroup, but it is
indexed by `Γ₀ˣ` and so forces a `LinearOrderedCommGroupWithZero` codomain. `IsContinuous` is
stated over a `LinearOrderedCommMonoidWithZero`, matching Mathlib's `Valuation`, and this
criterion is stated over one too — the strict triangle inequality needs no inverses. The
subgroup used below is therefore `EpsilonEridani.Valuation.ltAddSubgroupOfNeZero`, the analogue of
Mathlib's construction at the weaker codomain, rather than Mathlib's own.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.isContinuous_iff_forall_exists_idealImage_subset` : the
  criterion, in both directions.

  `2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08`, `projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/SpvAITopology.lean`,
  was consulted. It names `pow_image_isOpen` and `isContinuous_of_ideal_pow_lt` as consumers of
  exactly this criterion, which is what fixed its downstream-facing shape, but does not state the
  criterion itself and leaves the surrounding Wedhorn 7.10 sub-leaves incomplete.

/-- **Continuity, tested against the ideal-of-definition basis.** A valuation on a Huber ring is
continuous exactly when every set `{a | v a < v b}` contains the image of some power `Iⁿ` of an
ideal of definition.

The `b` with `v b = 0` are excluded because `{a | v a < 0}` is empty, hence not a subgroup;
`Valuation.isContinuous_iff_forall_ne_zero` shows they cost nothing. -/
