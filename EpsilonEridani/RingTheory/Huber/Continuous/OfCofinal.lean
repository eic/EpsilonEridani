# Cofinal values on a generating set make a valuation continuous

**Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1), the engine of Theorem 7.10's `⊇` direction.**

A valuation on a Huber ring is continuous as soon as it is bounded by `1` on an ideal of
definition `I` and has cofinal values on a generating set of `I`. That is exactly what the
right-hand side of Theorem 7.10 supplies: membership in `Spv (A, IA)` gives the cofinality
through Wedhorn Lemma 7.4 — on its cofinal branch directly, and on its full-characteristic-group
branch through `cofinalValue_of_hasFullCharacteristicGroup` below, since `v a < 1` on `I` places
the open ideal image, a neighbourhood of `0`, inside the unit ball — so the unit ball is itself a
neighbourhood of `0`. The same `v a < 1` gives the bound.

## What the argument actually needs

Continuity is tested against the basic neighbourhoods `Iⁿ` of zero
(`EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.isContinuous_iff_forall_exists_idealImage_subset`), so given `b`
with `v b ≠ 0` the task is to find one `n` with `v < v b` on the image of `Iⁿ`.

Only **one** generator has to be cofinal: one whose value dominates the others. Cofinality there
produces an `n` with `v t₀ ⁿ < v b`, the valuation bound on a power of a spanned ideal
(`Valuation.map_le_pow_of_mem_span_pow_succ`) gives `v ≤ v t₀ ⁿ` on `Iⁿ⁺¹`, and the two
inequalities compose. That is `isContinuous_of_forall_le_of_cofinalValue`, which asks for no
finiteness at all.

The form a call site actually holds — a *finite* generating set with *every* generator cofinal, as
Lemma 7.4 hands over — is the corollary `isContinuous_of_forall_cofinalValue`. Finiteness enters
there and only there, to produce the dominating generator as a maximum.

## Why the bound is taken over `A₀`

The valuation bound is applied through `v.comap P.ringOfDefinition.subtype`, over the ring of
definition rather than over `A`. That is forced rather than cosmetic. An element of `Iⁿ⁺¹` is a
sum of terms `c * t₀ * ⋯ * tₙ` whose coefficient `c` ranges over `A₀`, so the coefficient can be
absorbed into a generator — `c * t₀` lies in `I`, where `v ≤ 1` is available. Over the extension
`I · A` the coefficients range over all of `A` instead, and `v ≤ 1` on `I · A` does not follow
from these hypotheses.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.isContinuous_of_forall_le_of_cofinalValue` : the engine, needing
  cofinality at a single dominating generator.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.isContinuous_of_forall_cofinalValue` : its call-site form, for a
  finite generating set with every generator cofinal.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.cofinalValue_of_hasFullCharacteristicGroup` : the supply for
  Lemma 7.4's other branch — a full characteristic group makes every ideal-of-definition value
  cofinal, given `v a < 1` on the ideal of definition.

/-- **A single dominating cofinal generator makes a valuation continuous.** If `v ≤ 1` on an ideal
of definition `I`, and `I` is spanned by a set whose values `v` bounds by that of some `t₀` with
cofinal value, then `v` is continuous.

No finiteness is needed: the spanning set is an arbitrary `Set`, cofinality is asked of `t₀`
alone, and `t₀` need not even lie in the spanning set — dominating it is enough.
`isContinuous_of_forall_cofinalValue` below is the reading a call site usually holds. -/

/-- **Cofinal values on a finite generating set make a valuation continuous.** If `v ≤ 1` on an
ideal of definition `I` and `v` has cofinal values at every member of a finite generating set of
`I`, then `v` is continuous.

This is the engine above with the dominating generator produced as a maximum, which is the only
thing finiteness is used for. The empty generating set is allowed: it forces `I = ⊥`, whose first
basic neighbourhood is already `{0}`.

It is the form Wedhorn Theorem 7.10's `⊇` direction hands over: membership in `Spv (A, IA)`
supplies the cofinality through Lemma 7.4, and `v a < 1` on `I` supplies the bound. -/

/-- **Full characteristic group makes every ideal-of-definition value cofinal**, given the
sub-unit bound `v a < 1` on the ideal of definition.

This is the `Γ_v = cΓ_v` branch of Wedhorn's proof of Theorem 7.10, `⊇` direction: Lemma 7.4
splits membership in `Spv (A, IA)` into cofinality on `IA` — which
`isContinuous_of_forall_cofinalValue` consumes directly — or full characteristic group, which
this lemma reduces to the first case. The sub-unit bound is what hands the valuation-level lemma
its neighbourhood: `v a < 1` on `I` places the open ideal image inside the unit ball, so the
unit ball is itself a neighbourhood of `0`. -/
