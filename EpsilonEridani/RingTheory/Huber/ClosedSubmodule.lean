# Submodules with a module-finite closure are closed

A submodule of a complete, metrisable module over a complete Tate ring whose topological closure
is module-finite is itself closed. This is Bosch–Güntzer–Remmert §3.7.2/1 in its closure form, and
it is the closedness prerequisite on the route to Wedhorn 6.17/6.18. Its consequence for a
noetherian ring — every submodule of a finitely generated module is closed — is what makes a finite
presentation of a finite module *strict*, which is the form in which Wedhorn's Remark 8.29 consumes
Proposition 6.18(2).

The proof is one application of `EpsilonEridani.Huber.eq_top_of_dense_of_module_finite`, made inside the
closure `N.topologicalClosure` rather than inside the ambient module. That closure is closed in a
complete space, so it is complete — the one instance that has to be supplied by hand; it is a
uniform additive group with a countably generated uniformity by `Submodule.isUniformAddGroup` and
`Submodule.isCountablyGenerated_uniformity`; and it is module-finite by hypothesis. Inside that
closure the submodule `N` is dense, by the very definition of the closure. So `N` is everything in
the closure, that is `N.topologicalClosure = N`, and `N` is closed because its closure is.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.isClosed_of_module_finite_topologicalClosure`: a submodule whose topological
  closure is module-finite is closed.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.isClosed_of_isNoetherian`: in a noetherian module, *every* submodule is closed.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsTateRing.exists_presentation_isStrictMap_isOpenMap`: over a complete
  noetherian Tate ring, a finite module with its module topology has a presentation
  `Aⁿ →[u] Aᵐ →[p] M → 0` with `u` strict and `p` open — Wedhorn's Remark 8.29's use of
  Proposition 6.18(2).

## Provenance

Adapted from the AINTLIB development (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0), branch
`dev/adic-spaces` at commit `37bbdaeb9ad9`, file
`projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/WedhornBanachTheorem.lean`, where the same statement is
`fg_topologicalClosure_isClosed`. The argument is AINTLIB's, and the density step follows its
proof closely. Three things differ. AINTLIB establishes the uniform-group, countable-generation,
separation and `ContinuousSMul` instances on the closure by hand; here all four are found by
instance search — the first two from `Submodule.isUniformAddGroup` and
`Submodule.isCountablyGenerated_uniformity`, the last from this repository's `ContinuousSMul`
instance on a submodule — so only completeness is supplied. The engine is this repository's
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.eq_top_of_dense_of_module_finite`, stated with `T0Space`, rather than AINTLIB's
`T2Space`-based `eq_top_of_dense_of_finite`. And the passage from `N' = ⊤` back to
`N.topologicalClosure ≤ N` is `Submodule.comap_subtype_eq_top` rather than AINTLIB's element-level
unfolding.

`EpsilonEridani.Huber.isClosed_of_isNoetherian` follows the same development's
`_sub_lemma_L3_1b_fg_submodule_closed` (same file, line 778 at the commit above), which is where
the plan of discharging closedness from noetherianity is taken from. Only the plan is shared: that
proof concludes closedness from *completeness* of the finitely generated submodule, via its
`_sub_lemma_L3_1a_completion_fg_complete` and `completeSpace_coe_iff_isComplete`, whereas the proof
here routes through this file's own `isClosed_of_module_finite_topologicalClosure` and so never
mentions completeness of `N`. The hypotheses differ too: that statement asks for `[IsNoetherianRing
A]` together with an explicit `(hN_fg : N.FG)`, while `[IsNoetherian A V]` here covers every
submodule at once and needs no finite-generation argument at the call site. Sharing only the plan
is not a stylistic choice: that proof reaches completeness through
`_sub_lemma_L3_1a_completion_fg_complete`, whose body in that development is `sorry` (same file,
line 611), so its route is not available to import even in principle.

/-- **In a noetherian module, every submodule is closed.**

Every submodule of a noetherian module is finitely generated — the topological closure of `N`
included. That closure is therefore module-finite, which is exactly what
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.isClosed_of_module_finite_topologicalClosure` asks of it.

The hypothesis is on the module and not on the ring, because that is all the argument uses: the
noetherian-base, module-finite case is recovered from Mathlib's instance
`isNoetherian_of_isNoetherianRing_of_finite`, so no separate statement of it is needed.

This is the closedness statement of [Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*][wedhorn_adic], Proposition 6.17, for a
module whose complete metrisable topology is *given*. It is not that proposition: 6.17 is about the
canonical topology of 6.18(1), and the construction of that topology, together with its uniqueness,
is not available here. -/

/-- **A finite module over a complete noetherian Tate ring has a strict finite presentation.**
This is the sentence Wedhorn's Remark 8.29 opens with: "we find a presentation
`Aⁿ →[u] Aᵐ →[p] M → 0` (because `A` is noetherian). Proposition 6.18(2) shows that `u` and `p`
are continuous and open onto its image."

`M` carries its canonical topology, which is Mathlib's module topology: every complete
first-countable module topology on a finite module is the module topology
(`EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsTateRing.isModuleTopology`), so `IsModuleTopology A M` is the topology
Proposition 6.18(1) speaks of, and nothing else is asked of `M`. The presentation is Mathlib's
`Module.FinitePresentation.exists_fin'`, available because a finite module over a noetherian ring
is finitely presented. Both maps are continuous by `IsModuleTopology.continuous_of_linearMap`,
`p` is open by `IsModuleTopology.isOpenMap_of_surjective` — the module topology on `M` is the
quotient topology along any linear surjection from `Aᵐ` — and `u` is strict by
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsTateRing.isStrictMap_of_isClosed_range`, its range being closed in `Aᵐ` by
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.isClosed_of_isNoetherian`. That closedness is the one place, beyond the existence
of the presentation, where `A` being noetherian enters, and the open mapping theorem is spent on
the free module `Aᵐ`, not on `M`. -/
