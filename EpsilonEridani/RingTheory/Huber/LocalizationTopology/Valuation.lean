# Extending a valuation to Wedhorn's topological localisation

Roadmap Layer 3.1 attaches to a rational subset `U = R(T/s)` of `X = Spa(A, A⁺)` a coordinate
ring together with its ring of integral elements, and asks for a natural homeomorphism

```text
Spa (A_U, A_U⁺) ≃ U.
```

The map from left to right is built in
`EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.AdicSpace.Spa.Localization.Basic`; the map in the other direction has
to *produce* a point of an adic spectrum out of a point of `U`, and this file is its algebraic
core, before any completion.

Mathlib's `Valuation.extendToLocalization`, specialised to the away submonoid in
`EpsilonEridani.RingTheory.Valuation.ExtendToLocalization`, already extends a valuation `v` with
`v s ≠ 0` from `A` to a localisation `Aₛ` away from `s`. What has to be proved is that the
extension satisfies the two conditions defining a point of `Spa (Aₛ, Aₛ⁺)`:

* it is **continuous** for the localisation topology of Wedhorn's Proposition and
  Definition 5.51 — `EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.locTopology`; and
* it is **bounded by `1`** on the integral closure of `A⁺[T/s]`, the plus ring that
  `EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.isRingOfIntegralElements_integralClosure_adjoin_plus` makes a
  ring of integral elements of `Aₛ`.

Both use `v t ≤ v s` for every numerator and `v s ≠ 0`. Continuity additionally requires `v` to
be continuous and `v ≤ 1` on the chosen ring of definition `A₀`; sub-unitness on the plus ring
additionally requires `v ≤ 1` on `A⁺`. For a point of `Spa(A, A⁺)`, continuity and the bound on
`A⁺` are part of membership, while a choice `A₀ ⊆ A⁺` supplies the remaining bound.

## Why continuity needs a bound on the ring of definition

The neighbourhoods of zero in `Aₛ` are the images of the powers `Jⁿ` of `J = I · D`, where
`D = A₀[t₁/s, …, tₙ/s]`. That is an ideal *of `D`*, so a bound on `v` over `Iⁿ` alone says
nothing about it: a general element is a `D`-combination of images from `Iⁿ`, and the `D`-factor
has to be harmless. So `isContinuous_extendToLocalization` asks for `v ≤ 1` on `A₀`, which
together with `v t ≤ v s` puts the whole of `D` inside the valuation ring of the extension
(`PairOfDefinition.extendToLocalization_le_one_of_mem_locSubring`).

That hypothesis is **not automatic** for a continuous valuation. Give `ℚ` the discrete topology:
it is a Huber ring with ring of definition `ℚ` and ideal of definition `0`, every valuation on it
is continuous (`Valuation.isContinuous_of_discreteTopology`), and the `p`-adic valuation has
`v (1/p) > 1` with `1/p` in the ring of definition.

It is **not restrictive** either, and that is what makes the results below usable rather than
conditional. A ring of integral elements `A⁺` is by definition open, so
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.exists_pairOfDefinition_ringOfDefinition_le` supplies a pair of
definition with `A₀ ⊆ A⁺`; and every point of `Spa (A, A⁺)` is `≤ 1` on `A⁺`. The choice of pair
of definition is free, and this one costs nothing.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.extendToLocalization_le_one_of_mem_locSubring`: the extension
  is `≤ 1` on the candidate ring of definition `D = A₀[T/s]` of `Aₛ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.extendToLocalization_lt_of_mem_locIdealImage`: if `v` is
  smaller than `γ` on the image of `Iⁿ`, then the extension is smaller than `γ` on the whole
  `n`-th basic neighbourhood of zero in `Aₛ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.isContinuous_extendToLocalization`: **the extension of a
  continuous valuation is continuous** for `locTopology`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.le_one_of_mem_integralClosure_adjoin_plus`: **any valuation on `Aₛ` bounded by
  `1` on the image of `A⁺` and on the fractions `t/s` is `≤ 1` on the plus ring of the
  localisation**, the integral closure of `A⁺[T/s]` in `Aₛ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.extendToLocalization_le_one_of_mem_integralClosure_adjoin_plus`: **the extension
  is `≤ 1` on the plus ring of the localisation**, the previous result for the extension of a
  valuation on `A`.

The two headline results are assembled into a statement about adic spectra in
`EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.AdicSpace.Spa.Localization.Surjective`.

## What is not proved here

Nothing about the *completed* localisation `A⟨T/s⟩`. Extending a continuous valuation from a
Huber ring to its Hausdorff completion is a separate theorem, and it is not used or assumed
below; every statement here concerns `Aₛ` with `locTopology`.

## References

* [T. Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*][wedhorn_adic] (arXiv:1910.05934v1), Proposition and
  Definition 5.51 for the localisation topology, §7.3 for rational subsets, and §8.1 for the
  coordinate ring of a rational subset.

## Provenance

The mathematics is Huber's, in the form of Wedhorn's §8.1 identification of the adic spectrum of
a rational localisation with the rational subset; the Lean is written against this repository's
own `locTopology` and `locSubring` API together with Mathlib's `Valuation.extendToLocalization`,
and follows no existing formalisation. AINTLIB — the roadmap's designated prior formalisation of
this material — was **not** consulted: no checkout of it was available in the authoring
environment. Nothing is ported.

The image of `Jⁿ` is not merely the image of `Iⁿ`: `Jⁿ` is the ideal of `D` spanned by that
image, so its elements are `D`-combinations. That is why the hypotheses bounding the extension on
`D` appear here as well. -/
