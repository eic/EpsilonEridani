# Dense submodules of a module-finite complete Tate-module

A dense submodule of a module-finite, complete, metrisable module over a complete Tate ring is
the whole module. This is Bosch–Güntzer–Remmert §3.7.2/1 in its intrinsic form, and it is the
step that makes finitely generated submodules closed on the route to Wedhorn 6.17/6.18.

The argument is the open mapping theorem followed by Nakayama. A finite spanning family presents
`V` as an *open* quotient of `Aⁿ`
(`EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsTateRing.isOpenMap_linearCombination`), so the image of a neighbourhood of zero
consisting of topologically nilpotent scalars is a neighbourhood of zero in `V`. Density writes
each generator as `gᵥ = mᵥ + ∑ⱼ aᵥⱼ • gⱼ` with `mᵥ` in the submodule and every `aᵥⱼ` topologically
nilpotent, and matrix Nakayama in the quotient
(`EpsilonEridani.Huber.eq_zero_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent_entries_of_forall_eq_sum_smul`) forces every
generator into the submodule.

The neighbourhood of topologically nilpotent scalars is `A°°` itself, which is open
(`EpsilonEridani.Huber.isOpen_setOf_isTopologicallyNilpotent`) and contains zero, so neither an ideal of
definition nor a pseudouniformiser has to be chosen.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Huber.eq_top_of_dense_of_module_finite`: a dense submodule of a module-finite complete
  Tate-module is everything.

## References

* [Bosch, Güntzer, Remmert, *Non-Archimedean Analysis*][bosch-guntzer-remmert], §3.7.2/1.

Adapted from the AINTLIB development (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0), branch
`dev/adic-spaces` at commit `37bbdaeb9ad9`, file
`projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/WedhornBanachTheorem.lean`, where the same statement is
`eq_top_of_dense_of_finite`. The argument is AINTLIB's; three things differ. The target is
separated by `T0Space` rather than `T2Space`. The neighbourhood of topologically nilpotent
scalars is `A°°` itself rather than `ϖ • A⁰` for a chosen pseudouniformiser, so no unit has to
be produced. And the open presentation is the named
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsTateRing.isOpenMap_linearCombination` rather than a locally built linear map.

/-- **A dense submodule of a module-finite complete Tate-module is everything**
(Bosch–Güntzer–Remmert §3.7.2/1).

`N` is a submodule of `V` whose closure is all of `V`; the conclusion is that `N` was already all
of `V`. The hypotheses are carried by the ambient instances: `A` is a complete Hausdorff Tate
ring, `V` is a complete `T0` topological `A`-module with countably generated uniformity and
continuous scalar action, and `V` is *module-finite* over `A`. Module-finiteness is what makes
the statement true — a dense submodule of an infinite-dimensional complete module need not be
everything.

The proof is the open mapping theorem followed by matrix Nakayama; see the module docstring. -/
