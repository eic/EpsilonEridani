# The grading induced on a quotient by a homogeneous ideal

A homogeneous two-sided ideal `I` in an `R`-algebra `A` graded by `𝒜` descends that grading to
`A ⧸ I`. Its degree-`i` piece is `EpsilonEridani.GradedAlgebra.quotientPiece 𝒜 I i`, the image of `𝒜 i`
under the quotient map. The scalar base `R` can be a commutative semiring.

The graded pieces are submodules of the quotient itself. Homogeneity lets the additive degree
projections descend to the quotient, where they recover each coordinate of a finite sum. Thus the
pieces form an internal direct sum, giving `EpsilonEridani.GradedAlgebra.gradedAlgebraQuotientPiece`.
This structure is a definition rather than a global instance: callers choose the grading locally
with `letI`.

The construction follows Antoine Chambert-Loir's
[Mathlib PR #36501](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/36501): the degree-`i`
piece as the image of `𝒜 i` under the quotient map, separation of the pieces via
`GradedRing.proj`, and the induced `GradedAlgebra` assembled from `DirectSum.IsInternal`.
