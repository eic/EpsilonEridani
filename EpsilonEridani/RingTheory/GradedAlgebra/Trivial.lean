# The trivial grading of an algebra

Every algebra has a grading concentrated in degree zero.  This file packages that grading in the
internal `GradedAlgebra` presentation and records its elementary membership and projection API.
It is the canonical target grading for augmentations of integer-graded algebras.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.trivialGrading`: the internal integer grading with the whole algebra in degree zero.
* `EpsilonEridani.toTrivialGradingZero`: the algebra viewed as the degree-zero piece of that grading.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.instGradedAlgebraTrivialGrading`: the trivial grading is a graded algebra.
* `EpsilonEridani.proj_trivialGrading`: its degree projection is the identity in degree zero and zero in
  every other degree.
