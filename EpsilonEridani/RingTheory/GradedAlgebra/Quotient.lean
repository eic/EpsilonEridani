# Submodule families in an ideal quotient

`EpsilonEridani.GradedAlgebra.quotientPiece 𝒜 I i` is the image of the submodule `𝒜 i` under
`Ideal.Quotient.mkₐ R I`. The family can be arbitrary: multiplicative families descend to
multiplicative families, and spanning families descend to spanning families. These results apply
to overlapping families such as polynomial degree filtrations, without asserting a direct-sum
grading of the quotient.

The scalar base is a commutative semiring, and `I` is a two-sided ideal of the ambient ring.
When `𝒜` is a grading and `I` is homogeneous, the additional direct-sum construction is in
`EpsilonEridani.RingTheory.GradedAlgebra.Homogeneous.Quotient`.

The quotient-piece construction follows Antoine Chambert-Loir's
[Mathlib PR #36501](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/36501).

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GradedAlgebra.quotientPiece_mul_quotientPiece_le`: multiplication respects the family.
* `EpsilonEridani.GradedAlgebra.quotientPiece_eq_span_image`: taking quotient pieces commutes with spans.
* `EpsilonEridani.GradedAlgebra.iSup_quotientPiece_eq_top`: a spanning family spans the quotient.
