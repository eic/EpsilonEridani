# The valuative criterion for integrality

If every valuation of `R` that is bounded by `1` on a subring `B` is also bounded by `1` at
`x`, then `x` is integral over `B`.

This is the hard direction of the correspondence Wedhorn records as Proposition 7.18, for
which he gives only the citation [Hu2, Lemma 3.3]. It is the substantial ingredient of the
comparison between two presentations of a rational subset, which Layer 3.1 of the roadmap
asks for and which `presentationRingEquiv` currently takes as a hypothesis.

## Method

The proof has two steps, and `R` is an arbitrary commutative ring in the statement.

For a **domain** the argument is by contraposition through the fraction field. If `x` is not
integral over `B` then its image is outside the integral closure of `B` in `Frac R`, so
`Subring.exists_le_valuationSubring_of_isIntegrallyClosedIn` — the Stacks project's 090P(1) —
produces a valuation subring `V` containing that closure and missing the image of `x`.
Pulling `V.valuation` back along the inclusion gives a valuation of `R` bounded by `1` on `B`
but not at `x`, contradicting the hypothesis.

Routing through `Frac R` needs `R` to be a domain, which is a hypothesis Wedhorn's statement
does not carry. It is removed by **reducing modulo a prime**: by
`EpsilonEridani.isIntegral_of_forall_isPrime_map` it is enough to be integral over the image of `B` in
`R ⧸ J` for every prime `J`, and each `R ⧸ J` is a domain, so the domain case applies there. Its
hypothesis is met because a valuation of `R ⧸ J` pulls back along `Ideal.Quotient.mk J`, by
`ValuativeRel.comap`, to one of `R`, which the hypothesis on `R` bounds. So the criterion
holds for `R` in general.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isIntegral_of_forall_valuation_le_one`: the criterion.

## References

* [T. Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*][wedhorn_adic] (arXiv:1910.05934v1), Proposition 7.18, stated
  there with the proof given as the citation [Hu2, Lemma 3.3].
* [C. Birkbeck, *AINTLIB*](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB), commit `37bbdaeb9`,
  `projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/Presheaf.lean`, `isIntegral_of_forall_valuation_le_one` — the
  proof route followed in the domain step. **Adapted, not copied**: that declaration carries an
  openness hypothesis its own underscore marks as unused, so the topology is dropped and the
  statement here is purely algebraic, which is why this file sits under `RingTheory/Valuation/`.
  It also assumes `[IsDomain R]`, as every version of this criterion in that development does;
  the reduction to a prime quotient that removes the hypothesis has no counterpart there.

/-- **The valuative criterion for integrality.** If `v x ≤ 1` for every valuation `v` of `R`
satisfying `v b ≤ 1` for all `b ∈ B`, then `x` is integral over `B`.

This is the hard direction of Wedhorn's Proposition 7.18, for an arbitrary commutative ring —
the generality he states it in. The proof of the domain case goes through `Frac R`, and the
general case is reduced to it by `isIntegral_of_forall_isPrime_map`, which asks only that `x`
become integral in every prime quotient. -/
