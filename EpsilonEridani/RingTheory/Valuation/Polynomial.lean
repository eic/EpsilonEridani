# Polynomial expressions in the integers of a valuation

A valuation takes value at most `1` on every polynomial expression in an element of value at most
`1`, provided the images of the coefficients also have value at most `1`. Concretely, the ring of
integers `v.integer` is a subring containing the images of the coefficients, so it contains every
`aeval t p` with `t` in it; the proof below is the ultrametric bound on the coefficient sum, which
is what `Valuation` supplies directly.

For the tautological valuation of a valuation subring containing a field of constants, a polynomial
with nonzero constant term evaluated at an element of value less than `1` has value exactly `1`:
the constant term strictly dominates all the others. This is the polynomial estimate used in
Stichtenoth's proof that valuation rings of algebraic function fields are discrete.

## Main results

* `Valuation.aeval_le_one`: `v (Polynomial.aeval t p) ≤ 1` whenever `v t ≤ 1` and the images of
  the coefficients have value at most `1`.
* `EpsilonEridani.valuation_aeval_eq_one`: a polynomial with nonzero constant term has value `1` when
  evaluated at an element of the maximal ideal of a valuation subring containing the coefficients.

## Roadmap

`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, Layer 0–1 infrastructure: the place-at-infinity
argument for isogenies in
`AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Isogeny/InfinityPlace.lean` needs exactly this to see that a
pulled-back affine function of a Weierstrass curve — a polynomial in the pulled-back coordinates —
stays in the valuation ring at infinity. The statement is about a valuation and a polynomial and
nothing else, so it is stated here rather than there.

`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/AlgebraicCurves/README.md`, Layer 0: `EpsilonEridani.valuation_aeval_eq_one` is the
constant-term estimate used in Stichtenoth, Lemma 1.1.7, on the path to existence of places.
