# The canonical valuation of a valued ring is continuous

A `Valued R Γ₀` structure carries the topology defined by its valuation, and `Valued.isOpen_ball`
gives that every ball `{a | v a < γ}` is open. In particular the sets `{a | v a < v b}` cut out by
the *attained* values are open, which is exactly `Valuation.IsContinuous` for `Valued.v`.

## Main results

* `Valued.isContinuous_v` : the valuation of a `Valued` ring is continuous.
