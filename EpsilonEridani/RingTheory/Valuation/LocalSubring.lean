# A valuation subring that separates a point and is small on a prescribed ideal

Stacks 090P, in Mathlib as `Subring.exists_le_valuationSubring_of_isIntegrallyClosedIn`,
separates a point from a subring integrally closed in a field: for `R ≤ K` with `K` a field and
`z ∉ R`, some valuation subring `V ⊇ R` still misses `z`. Independently,
`Ideal.image_subset_nonunits_valuationSubring` puts a prescribed proper ideal `J` of `R` inside
the non-units of some valuation subring containing `R`. **Neither gives both at once**, and the
valuative criterion for integrality by *continuous* valuations needs both of a single `V`:
missing `z` is what refutes integrality, while `J` landing strictly below `1` is what makes the
induced valuation continuous when `J` is an ideal of definition.

## The hypothesis that combines them

Both conclusions can be read off one maximal ideal `𝔪` of `R`: the point is separated when `𝔪`
contains every denominator of `z` — the `s ∈ R` with `s * z ∈ R`, which are the denominator
ideal `Algebra.denIdeal K z` — and `J` lands below `1` when `𝔪` contains `J`. So the
hypothesis the construction actually needs is that the denominators and `J` sit inside a common
proper ideal, i.e. that their supremum is not `⊤`; that is what the main theorem assumes.

The form this takes in practice is that a *power* of `J` consists of denominators. That implies
the supremum hypothesis — choose `𝔪` over the denominators, and primality pulls `J` itself into
it — so the power-based statement is a corollary, recorded here because it is the shape a
topological ring hands over: multiplication by `z` is continuous and the powers of an ideal of
definition are a neighbourhood basis of `0`, so some power of it multiplies `z` back into any
given open subring. That step is topological and is left to the caller, which is why this file
states algebraic hypotheses and sits beside the Mathlib lemma it refines.

## Main results

* `Subring.exists_le_valuationSubring_notMem_valuation_lt_one` : the combined statement, under
  the supremum hypothesis.
* `Subring.exists_le_valuationSubring_notMem_valuation_lt_one_of_pow_mul_mem` : the corollary
  under the power hypothesis.
* `LocalSubring.isIntegrallyClosedIn_ofPrime` : localising at a prime preserves integral
  closedness in `K`, which is what lets Stacks 090P part (2) apply to the local subring built
  in that proof.
* `LocalSubring.notMem_ofPrime_of_denIdeal_le` : a point whose denominators all lie in `𝔪` is
  still missing from the localisation at `𝔪`.

Adapted from [C. Birkbeck, *AINTLIB*](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB), branch
`dev/adic-spaces`, commit `37bbdaeb9`, `projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/Presheaf.lean`,
declarations `conductorIdeal`, `conductorIdeal_ne_top`, `notMem_ofPrime_of_conductor_le`,
`isIntegrallyClosedIn_ofPrime` and `exists_valuationSubring_of_notMem_integralClosure`, where
this argument is carried out. **Adapted, not copied.** That development states the result for a
topological ring with a pair of definition, with `R` the integral closure of an open subring in
a fraction field, and defines its own `conductorIdeal`; here the statement is purely algebraic —
an arbitrary subring integrally closed in `K`, an arbitrary ideal, and the explicit hypothesis
that it generates a proper ideal together with the denominators of `z` — and the denominators
are this repository's existing `Algebra.denIdeal` rather than a new definition.

/-- **A valuation subring separating `z` and strictly below `1` on `J`.** Let `R` be a subring
of a field `K`, integrally closed in `K`, let `z : K`, and let `J` be an ideal of `R` which
together with the denominators of `z` generates a proper ideal. Then a single valuation subring
`V ⊇ R` both misses `z` and has valuation `< 1` at every element of `J`.

The hypothesis is what the construction needs and no more: one maximal ideal `𝔪` above the
supremum serves both halves. It forces `z ∉ R`, since `z ∈ R` makes `1` a denominator and the
denominator ideal `⊤`.

This refines Stacks 090P: the separation alone is
`Subring.exists_le_valuationSubring_of_isIntegrallyClosedIn`, and the bound on `J` alone is
`Ideal.image_subset_nonunits_valuationSubring`. Taking `J = ⊥` recovers the former, so the
strength here is that one `V` does both. -/
