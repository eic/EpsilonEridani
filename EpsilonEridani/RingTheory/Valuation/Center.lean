# Centres of valuations on subrings

A valuation of a field `K` that is bounded by `1` on a commutative ring `R` determines a prime
ideal of `R`: the elements whose images have value strictly below `1`. When `K` is the fraction
field of `R` and the valuation is nontrivial, this centre is nonzero. The value group may be any
linearly ordered commutative group with zero.

## Main definitions and results

* `Valuation.centerIdeal`: the prime centre of a valuation bounded by `1` on `R`.
* `Valuation.mem_centerIdeal`: membership is equivalent to valuation strictly below `1`.
* `Valuation.centerIdeal_ne_bot`: a nontrivial valuation of the fraction field has nonzero centre.
* `Valuation.heightOneSpectrum`: the nonzero prime centre bundled as `HeightOneSpectrum R`.
  This structure records a nonzero prime ideal; it is a height one prime when `R` is Dedekind.
* `Valuation.asIdeal_heightOneSpectrum`: the underlying ideal is the centre ideal.
