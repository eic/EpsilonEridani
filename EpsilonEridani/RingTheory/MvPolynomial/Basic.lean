# Finiteness of `MvPolynomial.map`

`MvPolynomial.map f` is a finite ring map whenever `f` is: a family generating `S` over `R`
generates `MvPolynomial σ S` over `MvPolynomial σ R` once its members are read as constants.

This is the coefficient-extension half of the finiteness that Stacks 10.161.13 (tag 032O)
records as "`R'[x^{1/q}]` is finite over `R[x]`"; the `expand` half lives in
`EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/MvPolynomial/Expand.lean`. Nothing here mentions `expand`, which is why it
sits in this file rather than that one.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.MvPolynomial.finite_map`: `MvPolynomial.map f` is finite when `f` is.

## Provenance

Roadmap: EllipticCurves, the Layers 0-1 target *Function-field foundations and isogenies*
(`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:1096`), through the support module
`RingTheory/IntegralClosure/NormalizationFinite`. The argument is Stacks 10.161.13 (tag 032O),
which is univariate and whose proof records it as "Since `R` is N-2 we see that `R′` is finite
over `R` and hence `R′[x^{1/q}]` is finite over `R[x]`"; the multivariate form is not claimed as
source material.
