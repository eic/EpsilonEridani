# The symmetric homogeneous polynomials of a fixed degree

The symmetric polynomials of `Mathlib.RingTheory.MvPolynomial.Symmetric.Defs` are graded by total
degree, each graded piece being the intersection of `MvPolynomial.symmetricSubalgebra` with the
homogeneous polynomials `MvPolynomial.homogeneousSubmodule` of that degree.  This file names that
intersection, `EpsilonEridani.symmetricHomogeneousSubmodule`, and nothing else; it is the module the
classical families of symmetric polynomials are bases of, one degree at a time: the monomial
symmetric polynomials over any commutative semiring, and the Schur polynomials over a commutative
ring.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.symmetricHomogeneousSubmodule σ R n`: the polynomials in `σ` over `R` that are both
  symmetric and homogeneous of degree `n`.

of those partitions are a basis of it over a commutative ring. -/
