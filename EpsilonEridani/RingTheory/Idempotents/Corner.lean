# Corners cut out by two idempotents

Let `A` be an algebra over a commutative semiring `k`. This file defines the corner `eAf` as the
range of the `k`-linear map `x ↦ e * x * f`. When `e` and `f` are idempotent, membership is
equivalent to the fixed-point equation `e * x * f = x`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.cornerMap`: the `k`-linear map `x ↦ e * x * f`.
* `EpsilonEridani.cornerSubmodule`: the corner `eAf`, as a `k`-submodule of `A`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.mem_cornerSubmodule_iff`: the fixed-point characterization of an idempotent corner.

## References

This is the corner infrastructure used by Layer 3 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ZigzagPreprojective/README.md`. See I. Assem, D. Simson, A. Skowroński,
