# The norm modulo an ideal

Let `S` be a finite free `R`-algebra and `I` an ideal of `R`. The norm of `S ⧸ IS` over `R ⧸ I`
of the class of `x` is the class of the norm of `x`. This is the norm counterpart of Mathlib's
`Algebra.trace_quotient_mk`. It lets a norm equation over `R` be solved first over the quotient:
taking `I` to be the maximal ideal of a local ring, it supplies the residual norm input for lifting
norm equations with Hensel's lemma
(`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.exists_norm_eq_of_norm_sub_mem_maximalIdeal`).

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.norm_quotient_mk`: the norm of `S ⧸ IS` over `R ⧸ I` of the class of `x` is
  the class of the norm of `x`.

/-- **The norm commutes with reduction modulo an ideal.** For a finite free algebra `S` over `R`
and an ideal `I` of `R`, the norm of `S ⧸ IS` over `R ⧸ I` of the class of `x` is the class of the
