# Products over a finite set of primes

In a unique factorization monoid whose only unit is `1`, the passage from a finite set `S` of
primes to the product `∏ p ∈ S, p` loses no information: the normalized factors of the product
are exactly the elements of `S`, distinct sets of primes have distinct products, and every
divisor of the product is the product of a subset of `S`.

These are the facts that turn a divisibility statement about a product of distinct primes into a
statement about subsets of the set of factors. The hypothesis on the units is what makes the
conclusions equalities rather than statements up to associates; the motivating example is the
multiplicative monoid of ideals of a Dedekind domain.
