# The Selmer group of a number field is finite

The finiteness proved in `EpsilonEridani.RingTheory.DedekindDomain.SInteger.SelmerGroup.Basic` asks its
Dedekind domain for a finite class group and a finitely generated unit group. For the ring of
integers of a number field both are theorems of Mathlib -- the class number theorem and
Dirichlet's unit theorem -- so there the Selmer group `K(S, n)` is finite with no hypothesis
beyond the finiteness of `S`.

## Main results

* `IsDedekindDomain.finite_selmerGroup_of_numberField`: `K(S, n)` is finite for every finite `S`
  and every `n` with `NeZero n`.

`EllipticCurves` roadmap's pin `66889eada51a`, Apache 2.0, by Michael Stoll), where the same
specialisation is drawn from the general finiteness statement.
