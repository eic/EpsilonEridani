# Natural-number valuations in adic completions

Let `v` be a height-one prime of a Dedekind domain `R`, with finite residue field and fraction
field `K`. For a natural number whose image in the completion `K_v` is nonzero, its normalized
additive valuation there is the exponent of `v` in the principal ideal that the number generates
in `R`.

This identifies the local-field normalization, in which a uniformizer has valuation one, with
the global ideal-theoretic normalization by prime multiplicity. It is the bridge needed when a
local ramification bound contains the valuation of a natural number and is transported back to a
global prime.

## Main result

* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.natCastValuation_completion_eq_multiplicity_span`:
  for `v` with finite residue field, if the image of `n` in `K_v` is nonzero, its normalized
  valuation there is the multiplicity of `v` in `(n)`.
