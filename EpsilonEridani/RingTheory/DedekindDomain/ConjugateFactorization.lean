# Factoring a product of conjugate primes in a Dedekind domain

Let `R` be a Dedekind domain carrying a ring endomorphism `σ`, and let `S` be a finite set of
nonzero primes of `R` on which `σ` acts involutively. This file characterizes the ideals `A` with
`A * σ A = ∏ p ∈ S, p` as exactly the products over the transversals of `σ` on `S`. When `σ`
additionally has no fixed points on `S`, so that `S` splits into conjugate pairs `{p, σ p}`, it
also proves that there are exactly `2 ^ (#S / 2)` such ideals, one for each choice of a prime from
each conjugate pair. Fixed-point-freeness is needed only for this count.

The count is what makes such factorizations a source of many ideals with a prescribed conjugate
product: taking `S` to be a set of primes above rational primes that split into conjugate pairs,
the theorem produces exactly `2 ^ (#S / 2)` ideals `A` with `A · σA` the prescribed ideal. The
argument is the interplay of two facts: a divisor of a product of distinct primes is the product
of a subset of them (`EpsilonEridani.exists_subset_finset_prod_eq_of_dvd`), and the
transversals of a fixed-point-free involution are counted by
`EpsilonEridani.ncard_setOf_isInvolutionTransversal`.

## References

The existence half of the count is `exists_transversal_family` in the formalization
[kim-em/erdos-unit-distance](https://github.com/kim-em/erdos-unit-distance), written for
Alpöge's disproof of the uniform-constant Erdős unit-distance conjecture, where it is stated as
the lower bound `2 ^ (#S / 2) ≤ #G` for a family `G` of such ideals. The induction on `S` that
strips off one conjugate pair at a time is taken from there; it is carried out here on the
transversals rather than on the ideals, which turns the bound into the exact count and separates
the combinatorics from the arithmetic.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.mul_map_eq_prod_iff`: `A * σ A = ∏ p ∈ S, p` exactly when `A` is the product over a
  transversal of `σ` on `S`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ncard_setOf_mul_map_eq_prod`: there are exactly `2 ^ (#S / 2)` such `A`.
