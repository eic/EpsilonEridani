# Overrings of a Dedekind domain in its fraction field

An *overring* of `A` here is a subalgebra of the fraction field `K` of `A`, that is, a ring between
`A` and `K`. Every such ring is integrally closed: its localizations at maximal ideals are
localizations of `A` too, and those are valuation rings of `K`, or `K` itself over the zero prime.

Nothing about integral closures of `A` in *larger* fields is needed for this, which is why it lives
apart from `RingTheory/IntegralClosure/`.

The extension to an overring `B` of a height one prime `𝔭` of `A` is read off the valuation of
`𝔭`. If some element of `B` has a pole at `𝔭`, the extension is the unit ideal: that pole puts an
element of `A` outside `𝔭` into `𝔭B`. If instead the valuation of `𝔭` is the valuation of a height
one prime `𝔓` of `B`, then `𝔓` is the only prime of `B` containing `𝔭B`, and `𝔭B = 𝔓`, with no
ramification, the two rings having the same fraction field.

## Main results

* `Subalgebra.isIntegrallyClosed_overring`: every subalgebra of the fraction field of a Dedekind
  domain is integrally closed.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.map_asIdeal_eq_top_of_one_lt_valuation`: a prime extends to
  the unit ideal of an overring containing an element with a pole at it.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.map_asIdeal_eq_asIdeal_of_valuation_eq`: a prime extends to
  the prime of an overring carrying the same valuation.
