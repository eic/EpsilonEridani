# Binary forms with unit coefficients over a Henselian local ring

Let `R` be a Henselian local ring whose residue field is finite and in which `2` is a unit. Then
every binary form `a x² + b y²` with unit coefficients represents every unit `c` of `R`.

Over the finite residue field of odd characteristic this is the universality of regular binary
forms. Since `c` is a unit, one of the two coordinates of a residue solution is nonzero; the
other coordinate is lifted arbitrarily, and the nonzero one is lifted by Hensel's lemma, which
applies because the derivative `2x` of `X² - u` is a unit there.

A consequence is that a diagonal quadratic form with at least three unit coefficients is
isotropic: `a x² + b y² = -c` gives the nonzero isotropic vector `(x, y, 1)`. Over the ring of
integers of a nonarchimedean local field of odd residue characteristic, this makes a fixed
regular form over a number field isotropic at almost every finite place.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_mul_sq_add_mul_sq_eq_of_isUnit`: `a x² + b y² = c` is solvable in `R` when
  `a`, `b` and `c` are units.
