# A finite product of flat modules is flat, and when it is faithfully flat

Mathlib knows that an arbitrary direct sum of flat modules is flat (`Module.Flat.directSum`), but
`∀ i, M i` is not definitionally a direct sum, so nothing fires for a product. Over a finite index
the two agree, and this file records the resulting instance together with the criterion that
upgrades it to faithful flatness.

Mathlib defines `Module.FaithfullyFlat` as flatness plus `m • ⊤ ≠ ⊤` for every maximal ideal `m`,
so the criterion is about locating a single component that keeps `m` proper — the factorwise half
of that is `Ideal.smul_top_eq_top_of_pi`, a general ideal-action fact with no flatness or
finiteness in it, which lives in `EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/Ideal/Operations.lean`: a product is
faithfully flat as soon as each factor is flat and **no maximal ideal expands in every factor at
once**. Individually the factors may all fail to be faithfully flat.

## Main results

* `Module.Flat.pi`: a finite product of flat modules is flat.
* `Module.FaithfullyFlat.pi_of_exists_submodule_ne_top`: a finite product of flat modules is
  faithfully flat as soon as every maximal ideal stays proper in *some* factor.
* `Module.FaithfullyFlat.pi_of_faithfullyFlat`: the special case of one distinguished faithfully
  flat factor.
* `Module.FaithfullyFlat.pi`: a finite *nonempty* product of faithfully flat modules.

## Implementation notes

`Module.FaithfullyFlat.pi` asks `[Nonempty ι]`, and that is not slack: for `ι` empty the product
is the trivial module, in which `m • ⊤ = ⊤ = ⊥` for every `m`, so it is faithfully flat over no
nonzero ring at all — while `∀ i, FaithfullyFlat R (M i)` holds vacuously. Dropping the hypothesis
would make the instance false. Flatness has no such caveat: the trivial module is flat.

The finiteness is not an artefact of the comparison used here: by Chase's theorem a ring is
coherent exactly when every product of flat modules is flat, so over a non-coherent ring the
statement fails outright for a large enough index. Nothing is lost over a noetherian base, but the
hypothesis cannot simply be dropped.
