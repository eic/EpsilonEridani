# Reducedness of smooth algebras

A smooth algebra over a reduced commutative ring is reduced. The proof first treats integral
domains: a standard-smooth algebra embeds into its étale generic fibre over a polynomial ring,
and a standard-smooth localization cover gives the smooth case. For a reduced Noetherian base,
embed the base into the finite product of its minimal-prime domain quotients and use flatness.
Finally, Noetherian descent and passage through finitely generated subalgebras give the result
over an arbitrary reduced base.

Over any commutative ring, a smooth algebra is geometrically reduced: its base changes to
algebraic closures of residue fields are smooth over fields, hence reduced. This supplies the
reducedness of geometric fibres used in the study of smooth affine group schemes.
