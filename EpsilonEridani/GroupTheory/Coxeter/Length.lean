# The parity and the functoriality of the length function of a Coxeter system

Let `cs : CoxeterSystem M W` be a Coxeter system. Left multiplication by a fixed simple reflection
changes the length of an element by exactly one (`CoxeterSystem.length_mul_mod_two`), so it flips
the parity of the length. This file packages that pairing as an explicit equivalence
`EpsilonEridani.lengthParityEquiv` between the elements of even length and the elements of odd length, and
records its two immediate consequences: the two parity classes are equinumerous, and a Coxeter
group with at least one simple reflection has even order.

Finally, the length function is transported along the two canonical constructions on Coxeter
systems, `CoxeterSystem.reindex` and `CoxeterSystem.map`: relabelling the simple reflections or
pushing the system through a group isomorphism leaves lengths unchanged.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.lengthParityEquiv`: left multiplication by a simple reflection, as an equivalence
  between the even-length and the odd-length elements.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.natCard_length_even_eq_natCard_length_odd`: as many elements have even length as odd
  length, provided there is at least one simple reflection.
* `EpsilonEridani.even_natCard_of_nonempty_index`: hence a Coxeter group of positive rank has even order.
* `EpsilonEridani.length_reindex` and `EpsilonEridani.length_map`: the length function is unchanged by
  `CoxeterSystem.reindex` and by `CoxeterSystem.map`.
