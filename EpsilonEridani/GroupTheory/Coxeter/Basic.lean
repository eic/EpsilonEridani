# Elementary facts about Coxeter words

This file evaluates Mathlib's alternating words through an arbitrary family, and specialises that
evaluation to the lengths the braid relations are read off at. It also records the degenerate
rank-zero case: a Coxeter system whose simple reflections are indexed by an empty type has a
trivial group.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.prod_map_alternatingWord`: an alternating word of length `m`, evaluated through any
  family `f`. This is the shape in which a braid relation is checked against a family that is not
  yet known to satisfy it, so it cannot be routed through
  `CoxeterSystem.prod_alternatingWord_eq_mul_pow`, which evaluates only the simple reflections
  themselves. The evaluations at lengths `2` and `3` are special cases.
* `EpsilonEridani.reverse_alternatingWord_two_mul`: reversing an alternating word of even length swaps its
  two letters.
* `EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_of_isEmpty_index`: a Coxeter system of rank zero has a trivial group.

/-- An alternating word of length `m`, evaluated through any family `f`. Unlike
`CoxeterSystem.prod_alternatingWord_eq_mul_pow`, which evaluates the word at the simple reflections
of a Coxeter system, this holds for an arbitrary family, so it is available while checking that a
family satisfies the braid relations. -/
