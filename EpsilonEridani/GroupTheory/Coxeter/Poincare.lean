# The Poincaré polynomial of a finite Coxeter system

For a Coxeter system `cs : CoxeterSystem M W` with `W` finite, the **length generating function**
`∑_{w ∈ W} q^{ℓ(w)}` is a genuine polynomial with integer coefficients, the **Poincaré polynomial**
of `cs`. This file introduces it and proves the elementary facts that make it a generating
function: its coefficient at `k` counts the elements of length `k`, its value at `1` is the order
of `W`, its constant term is `1`, and its degree is the largest length occurring in `W`.

The theorem with content beyond bookkeeping is the value at `-1`. Left multiplication by a fixed
simple reflection is a sign-reversing involution of `W`
(`EpsilonEridani.length_simple_mul_mod_two`), so the alternating sum `∑_{w ∈ W} (-1)^{ℓ(w)}` vanishes as
soon as there is at least one simple reflection. The parity bookkeeping itself, together with the
equivalence between the two parity classes, lives in `EpsilonEridani/GroupTheory/Coxeter/Length.lean`.

At the other extreme, a Coxeter system indexed by an empty type has a trivial group -- every
element is the product of a word in the generators, and there are no generators -- so its Poincaré
polynomial is `1`. That degenerate case is recorded as well, since it is what pins the
normalisation of the constant term.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.poincarePolynomial`: the Poincaré polynomial `∑_{w ∈ W} q^{ℓ(w)} ∈ ℤ[q]` of a Coxeter
  system on a finite group.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.coeff_poincarePolynomial`: the coefficient of `q^k` counts the elements of length `k`.
* `EpsilonEridani.eval_one_poincarePolynomial`: the value at `1` is `|W|`.
* `EpsilonEridani.eval_neg_one_poincarePolynomial`: the value at `-1` is `0` when the simple reflections
  are indexed by a nonempty type.
* `EpsilonEridani.natDegree_poincarePolynomial` and `EpsilonEridani.leadingCoeff_poincarePolynomial`: the degree
  is the maximal length, and the leading coefficient counts the elements attaining it.
* `EpsilonEridani.poincarePolynomial_reindex` and `EpsilonEridani.poincarePolynomial_map`: the polynomial is
  invariant under the two canonical transports of a Coxeter system.
* `EpsilonEridani.poincarePolynomial_of_isEmpty` and `EpsilonEridani.poincarePolynomial_of_unique_index`: the two
  smallest cases, `1` in rank `0` and `1 + q` in rank `1`.

## Implementation notes

The polynomial is defined and its intrinsic properties are stated under `[Finite W]`, the
enumeration being supplied internally by `Fintype.ofFinite`; only the lemmas whose right-hand side
is itself a `Finset.univ` expression (the two unfolding lemmas) ask for `[Fintype W]`. Counts are
stated with `Nat.card` on a subtype rather than with a `Finset.filter`, so that no `DecidableEq` or
`DecidablePred` argument leaks into the statements, and the degree is characterised by
`IsGreatest` on the range of the length function rather than by a `Finset.sup`.

`coeff_poincarePolynomial` carries `@[simp low]` rather than a plain `@[simp]`: the specialised
`coeff_poincarePolynomial_zero` must fire first, since at equal priority the general lemma rewrites
its left-hand side and the `simpNF` linter then reports the constant-term lemma as not being in
simp-normal form.

Nothing here needs the group to be finitely generated, crystallographic, or attached to a root
system: the statements are about an arbitrary Coxeter system, which is where the roadmap places
them.
