# Regular triples and normal subgroups of triangle groups

A permutation triple `t` of degree `n` whose components have orders dividing `a`, `b`, `c` is a
permutation representation `EpsilonEridani.TriangleGroup.toPerm t : Δ(a, b, c) →* Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`.
The preimage of the stabilizer of a sheet `i` is the point stabilizer of this action.

This file proves the *normality criterion*: for a connected triple, the point stabilizer is a
normal subgroup of `Δ(a, b, c)` exactly when the triple is regular. In that case the point
stabilizer is the kernel of the representation, a normal subgroup whose index is the degree
`n`, the order of the monodromy group.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.TriangleGroup.normal_comap_stabilizer_toPerm_iff`: for a connected triple, the point
  stabilizer of its representation is normal exactly when the triple is regular.
* `EpsilonEridani.TriangleGroup.comap_stabilizer_toPerm_eq_ker`: when a sheet has trivial monodromy
  stabilizer (e.g. for a regular triple), its point stabilizer is the kernel of the representation.
* `EpsilonEridani.TriangleGroup.index_ker_toPerm`: the kernel of the representation has index the order
  of the monodromy group, and `EpsilonEridani.TriangleGroup.index_ker_toPerm_of_isRegular`: for a
  regular triple this is the degree.
