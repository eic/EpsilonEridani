# Joining a subgroup with a subgroup that normalizes it

Let `H` and `K` be subgroups of a group `G` with `K ≤ Subgroup.normalizer H`. Multiplication then
carries the external semidirect product `H ⋊ K` into `G`, and its image is the join `H ⊔ K`.

Mathlib builds the homomorphism as `SemidirectProduct.monoidHomSubgroup` and computes the carrier
of the join as `Subgroup.coe_mul_of_right_le_normalizer_left`, but records neither the range of
that homomorphism nor the elementwise normal form `g = x * t` that the carrier computation gives.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.SemidirectProduct.range_monoidHomSubgroup`: the range of the semidirect-product
  multiplication homomorphism is `H ⊔ K`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Subgroup.mem_sup_of_right_le_normalizer_left`: an element of `H ⊔ K` is a product of an
  element of `H` followed by an element of `K`.
