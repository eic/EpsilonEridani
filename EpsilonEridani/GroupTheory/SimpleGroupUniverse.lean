# Universe lowering for classifications of finite simple groups

Suppose a family `C` contains, up to isomorphism, every finite simple group whose carrier lies in
`Type`. Then it contains every finite simple group in an arbitrary universe.

The reason is specific to finite groups. Mathlib's `Shrink.{0} G` transports the group structure
of a finite group `G : Type u` to a carrier in `Type`, and `Shrink.mulEquiv` identifies the two
groups. Finiteness and simplicity transport to the shrunk carrier, so the small-universe
classification applies there; composing its isomorphism with `Shrink.mulEquiv.symm` returns an
isomorphism from the original group.

The candidates are not assumed to be groups, nor finite or simple. A classification statement
needs only say that each finite simple group is isomorphic to some candidate; structural
properties of the candidates may be established separately.

## Main result

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_mulEquiv_of_forall_finite_isSimpleGroup_zero`: a classification of groups in
  universe zero by a fixed family holds in every universe.

/-- **A classification of finite simple groups in universe zero holds in every universe.**

If every finite simple group with carrier in `Type` is isomorphic to a member of a fixed family
`C`, then the same conclusion holds for a finite simple group in any universe. The candidates
need only carry a multiplication: no group, finiteness or simplicity assumption is made on them. -/
