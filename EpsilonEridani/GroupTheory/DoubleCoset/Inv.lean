# Inverting a double coset

Inversion is an anti-automorphism of a group, so it carries the double coset `Γ₁ g Γ₂` to
`Γ₂ g⁻¹ Γ₁`: the flanking subgroups are exchanged and the element is inverted. This file records
that, as a set identity and in membership form.

Exchanging the flanking subgroups is what makes inversion useful for comparing the two sides of a
double coset: it turns a right-coset decomposition into a left-coset one, which is how a count
indexed by right cosets is matched with one indexed by left cosets.

## Main results

* `DoubleCoset.doubleCoset_inv`: as sets, `(Γ₁ g Γ₂)⁻¹ = Γ₂ g⁻¹ Γ₁`.
* `DoubleCoset.inv_mem_doubleCoset_inv_iff`: its membership form.

/-- **Inverting a double coset exchanges its flanking subgroups**: `x ∈ Γ₁ g Γ₂` if and only if
`x⁻¹ ∈ Γ₂ g⁻¹ Γ₁`. The membership form of `doubleCoset_inv`.

Not `@[simp]`, unlike `doubleCoset_inv`: `mem_doubleCoset_iff_mk_mem_orbit` already rewrites
membership in a double coset to membership in a `MulAction.orbit`, so this left-hand side is not
in simp normal form and `simpNF` rejects it. Apply it by name. -/
