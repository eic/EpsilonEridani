# Transitive actions

Mathlib's `MulAction.ofQuotientStabilizer` sends the coset of `g` in `G ⧸ stabilizer G b` to
`g • b`; it is injective by `MulAction.injective_ofQuotientStabilizer`, and its image is the orbit
of `b`, which is the orbit-stabiliser theorem. When the action is transitive that orbit is all of
`X`, so the map is a bijection. This file records that specialisation, together with the
equivariance -- Mathlib's `MulAction.ofQuotientStabilizer_smul` -- that makes it an isomorphism of
`G`-sets rather than a bare bijection.

It also records one closure property of pretransitivity, `EpsilonEridani.isPretransitive_prod_left`,
which needs no group and no action laws and so comes first, before any of the above structure is
assumed.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.quotientStabilizerEquiv`: for a transitive action of `G` on `X` and a point `b : X`,
  the equivalence `G ⧸ stabilizer G b ≃ X` sending the coset of `g` to `g • b`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.quotientStabilizerEquiv_mk`: its value on a coset, and
  `EpsilonEridani.quotientStabilizerEquiv_smul`: its equivariance.
* `EpsilonEridani.natCard_dvd_natCard_of_isPretransitive`: the number of points of a nonempty set acted
  on transitively divides the order of the group.
* `EpsilonEridani.stabilizer_eq_bot_of_natCard_eq`, `EpsilonEridani.eq_one_of_natCard_eq_of_smul_eq_self`: a
  transitive action of a group with as many elements as the finite set acted on is regular, so
  only the identity fixes a point.
* `EpsilonEridani.isPretransitive_prod_left`: a product with a subsingleton stays pretransitive.

## Implementation notes

The equivalence is unbundled -- an `Equiv` of types together with a separate equivariance lemma --
because that is the shape the constructions consuming it take their argument in, for instance
`EpsilonEridani.ofMulActionEquivCongr`, which builds the induced equivalence of permutation
representations.

/-- **Pairing a pretransitive action with a subsingleton leaves it pretransitive.** A scalar
carrying `p.1` to `q.1` carries `p` to `q` outright, the second coordinates being equal for want of
anywhere else to be, so neither a monoid nor any action law enters.

`Y` is allowed to be empty, in which case `X × Y` is empty and the statement is vacuous. Counting
the orbits of such a product -- via `EpsilonEridani.MulAction.card_orbitRelQuotient_eq_one`, which is the
value Burnside's lemma takes on it -- needs more than this: a genuine `MulAction` of a group, and
`Nonempty` to rule the empty case back out. -/
