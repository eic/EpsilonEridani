# Point stabilisers: their cardinality, and when they are normal

A count defined through a point stabiliser is useful only alongside the rules for moving it.
Three such rules are recorded here, all consequences of Mathlib machinery rather than new
mathematics, and all stated for `Nat.card` because that is the form a numerical invariant of
an orbit is wanted in. The first of them is what lets the count descend to the orbit space, so
that descent is recorded here as well, as the definition `cardStabilizerOnOrbit`.

*Along an orbit* the stabiliser order does not change: related points have conjugate
stabilisers, by `MulAction.stabilizerEquivStabilizerOfOrbitRel`.

*Along an equivariant injection* it does not change either: a map `α → β` carrying the action of
`G` to that of `H` along a group isomorphism `G ≃* H`, and separating the point from its
translates, identifies the stabilisers. So when the map is an equivalence, the equivalence of
orbit spaces it induces, `EpsilonEridani.MulAction.orbitRelQuotientCongr`, preserves
`cardStabilizerOnOrbit`, and so does the splitting `EpsilonEridani.MulAction.orbitRelQuotientSumEquiv` of
the orbit space of an action on a sum `α ⊕ β`. These are what move a weighted count of orbits from
one action to another.

*Along a surjection* it divides: if `f : G →* H` is onto and the two actions agree at the point
in question, then the `G`-order of that point's stabiliser is `Nat.card f.ker` times its
`H`-order. Taking `f` to be a quotient map gives the projective case, where the divisor is the
subgroup quotiented out.

A point stabiliser of a permutation representation `ρ : G →* Equiv.Perm α` is a subgroup of the
source, namely the comap of the stabiliser in `Equiv.Perm α`. The last two results say when that
subgroup is the kernel — so in particular normal — and, for a transitive representation, that
normality of it is equivalent to freeness of the action of the image.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.card_stabilizer_of_orbitRel`: the stabiliser order is an invariant of the orbit,
  with `EpsilonEridani.card_stabilizer_smul` the translate-presented corollary.
* `EpsilonEridani.cardStabilizerOnOrbit`: that order as a function on the orbit space, with
  `EpsilonEridani.cardStabilizerOnOrbit_mk` its evaluation lemma.
* `EpsilonEridani.card_stabilizer_congr`: the stabiliser order is preserved by a map carrying one action
  to another along a group isomorphism, if it separates the point from its translates.
* `EpsilonEridani.cardStabilizerOnOrbit_orbitRelQuotientCongr`: the orbit-space equivalence
  `EpsilonEridani.MulAction.orbitRelQuotientCongr` induced by an equivariant equivalence preserves the
  stabiliser orders.
* `EpsilonEridani.cardStabilizerOnOrbit_orbitRelQuotientSumEquiv_symm`: the splitting
  `EpsilonEridani.MulAction.orbitRelQuotientSumEquiv` of the orbit space of an action on `α ⊕ β`
  preserves the stabiliser orders.
* `EpsilonEridani.card_stabilizer_eq_card_ker_mul_card_stabilizer`: the stabiliser order divides by
  `Nat.card f.ker` along a surjection `f`, with
  `EpsilonEridani.card_stabilizer_eq_card_subgroup_mul_card_stabilizer_quotient` the quotient-map
  corollary and
  `EpsilonEridani.card_stabilizer_eq_card_subgroupOf_mul_card_stabilizer_map` its relative form, for a
  subgroup mapped into the quotient.
* `EpsilonEridani.card_stabilizer_subgroupOf`: the degenerate case of that surjection, where the map is
  the isomorphism `𝒢.subgroupOf ℋ ≃* 𝒢` and the order is unchanged.
* `EpsilonEridani.card_stabilizer_coset_eq_card_stabilizer_inv_smul`: the class of `g` in `G ⧸ H` has,
  inside `stabilizer G p`, a stabiliser of the same order as `g⁻¹ • p` has inside `H` —
  conjugation by `g` is the bijection.
* `MonoidHom.comap_stabilizer_eq_ker`: the point stabiliser of a permutation representation is
  its kernel as soon as the image has trivial stabiliser at that point, and
  `MonoidHom.normal_comap_stabilizer_iff_isCancelSMul`: for a transitive representation that
  happens exactly when the image acts freely, which is exactly when the point stabiliser is
  normal.

/-- **The order of a stabiliser is constant along an orbit**: points related by the orbit
relation have conjugate stabilisers, hence stabilisers of equal cardinality.

This is what lets a count defined through a point stabiliser — the order `e_P` of an elliptic
point of a Fuchsian group, say — be read as an invariant of the orbit. It holds with no
finiteness hypothesis: for an infinite stabiliser both sides are `0`, by `Nat.card`'s
convention. -/

/-- The orbit invariance of `card_stabilizer_of_orbitRel` in the form wanted when the second
point is presented as a translate of the first.

Not `@[simp]`: whether `Nat.card (MulAction.stabilizer G (g • a))` is in normal form depends on
the action, since a `simp` lemma for the particular `•` can rewrite inside it. -/

/-- **The stabiliser order as a function on the orbit space.** `card_stabilizer_of_orbitRel`
says the order is constant along an orbit, so it descends to `MulAction.orbitRel.Quotient G α`,
which is the form wanted when the count is summed over orbits rather than over points.

Note this counts the stabiliser in `G` itself. When the action is not faithful the kernel sits
inside every stabiliser and inflates each value by `Nat.card` of it — so for a group acting
through a quotient, this is the order upstairs, not the order of the group that acts
effectively. `card_stabilizer_eq_card_subgroup_mul_card_stabilizer_quotient` is the conversion
between the two. -/

`card_stabilizer_eq_card_ker_mul_card_stabilizer` for the quotient map, whose kernel is `N`.

This is the step from a matrix-group stabiliser order to the projective one. The divisor is
`Nat.card N` in general; for `SL(2, ℤ) ↠ PSL(2, ℤ)` that is the centre `±1`, so there the
elliptic orders `e_P` are the matrix counts halved. For a Fuchsian `Γ` with `-I ∉ Γ` the two
counts coincide. -/

of `a` in `Γ` is `Nat.card (N.subgroupOf Γ)` — the part of `N` that `Γ` actually contains — times
the stabiliser of `a` in the image of `Γ` in `G ⧸ N`.

`card_stabilizer_eq_card_subgroup_mul_card_stabilizer_quotient` is the case `Γ = ⊤`, where the
divisor is all of `N`. The relative statement is what a Fuchsian group needs, where `Γ` is a
subgroup of `SL(2, ℤ)` and `N` the centre: there the divisor measures how much of `±I` lies in
`Γ`, and the projective elliptic order `e_P` is the matrix stabiliser order divided by it.
Evaluating that divisor is a fact about the particular `Γ` and is not proved here. -/
