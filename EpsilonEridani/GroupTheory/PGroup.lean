# Results about `p`-groups

Mathlib's `IsPGroup.to_quotient` says that every quotient of a `p`-group is again a `p`-group.
This file records the complementary behaviour, in which the group is fixed and the normal
subgroup varies: how the property `IsPGroup p (G ⧸ N)` of *the quotient* behaves under
intersection of normal subgroups and under preimage along a group homomorphism. It also records
closure of `p`-groups under binary and finite products and under extensions, and their
disjointness from subgroups of order prime to `p`.

The two quotient statements are group-theoretic, with no topology. They are what makes the family of
normal subgroups with `p`-group quotient usable: `IsPGroup.quotient_inf` says the family is
closed under binary intersection, hence downward directed, and `IsPGroup.quotient_comap` says
it is contravariantly functorial. The profinite development uses the first to run a compactness
argument on the family of open normal subgroups with `p`-group quotient, and the second to see
that a homomorphism into a pro-`p` group kills their intersection.

## Main results

* `IsPGroup.prod`: a product of two `p`-groups is a `p`-group.
* `IsPGroup.pi`: a finite product of `p`-groups is a `p`-group.
* `IsPGroup.of_subgroup_of_quotient`: an extension of a `p`-group by a `p`-group is a
  `p`-group.
* `EpsilonEridani.disjoint_of_not_dvd_natCard_of_isPGroup`: a `p`-group meets a subgroup of order prime
  to `p` trivially.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_isPGroup_quotient_notMem_of_pow_pow_eq_one`: in a finite commutative
  group, an element of `p`-power order survives in some `p`-group quotient.
* `IsPGroup.index_eq_prime_of_isCoatom`: a maximal subgroup of a finite `p`-group has index
  `p`.
* `IsPGroup.exists_ne_one_le_centralizer`: a nontrivial finite `p`-subgroup lies in the
  centralizer of one of its nontrivial elements.
* `IsPGroup.quotient_inf`: if `G ⧸ M` and `G ⧸ N` are `p`-groups, so is `G ⧸ (M ⊓ N)`.
* `IsPGroup.quotient_comap`: if `H ⧸ N` is a `p`-group and `f : G →* H`, then `G ⧸ N.comap f`
  is a `p`-group.
