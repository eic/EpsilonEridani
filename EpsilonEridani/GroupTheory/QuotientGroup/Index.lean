# Indices in quotient groups

This file records how the index of the image of a subgroup in a quotient group is computed in
the original group. It is the `Nat.card` shadow of the coset-space bijection
`QuotientGroup.quotientQuotientEquivQuotientSup`, and is read off it.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.index_map_mk'_eq_index_sup`: the index of the image of `H` in `G ⧸ N` is the
  index of `H ⊔ N` in `G`.
