# Derived words and solvable groups

The `n`th derived word evaluates a perfect binary argument tree of depth `n` by balanced
commutators: the zeroth word is one group element, and the successor word is the commutator of two
copies of the preceding word. This file proves that its values generate the `n`th derived subgroup.
Consequently, a group is solvable exactly when one derived word is identically one. It also records
that solvability is invariant under isomorphism, and the characterization of solvability for
direct products via the two surjective projections and the converse product instance.

The identity formulation is useful when a group is represented by an affine scheme: an identity
between derived words can be checked on a schematically dense family of points, while the
subgroup-valued definition of the derived series cannot be compared pointwise in that way.

## Main declarations

* `MulEquiv.isSolvable_congr`: isomorphic groups are solvable together.
* `EpsilonEridani.isSolvable_prod_iff`: `G × H` is solvable if and only if both `G` and `H` are.
* `EpsilonEridani.DerivedWordArgs`: the recursively paired arguments of a derived word.
* `EpsilonEridani.derivedWord`: the balanced iterated commutator word.
* `EpsilonEridani.map_derivedWord`: derived words commute with group homomorphisms.
* `EpsilonEridani.derivedSeries_eq_closure_range_derivedWord`: the values of the `n`th derived word
  generate the `n`th derived subgroup.
* `EpsilonEridani.derivedWord_mem_derivedSeries`: derived-word values lie in the corresponding derived
  subgroup.
* `EpsilonEridani.derivedSeries_eq_bot_iff_derivedWord_eq_one`: a fixed derived subgroup vanishes exactly
  when its derived word is identically one.
* `EpsilonEridani.isSolvable_iff_exists_derivedWord_eq_one`: solvability is equivalent to a derived-word
  identity.

This is a prerequisite for descending geometric solvability along schematically dense morphisms
from smooth affine groups. That descent supplies the multiplication-image step in the construction
of the solvable radical in Layer 6 of the ReductiveGroups roadmap.
