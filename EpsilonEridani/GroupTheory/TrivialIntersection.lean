# Trivial-intersection subgroups and Frobenius complements

A subgroup `H` of `G` is a **trivial-intersection subgroup** when it meets each of its distinct
conjugates trivially: `H ⊓ g H g⁻¹ = ⊥` whenever `g ∉ H`.  Equivalently `H` is *malnormal*: a
nonidentity element of `H` is conjugated out of `H` by every `g ∉ H`.  A **Frobenius complement**
is such a subgroup that is in addition proper and nontrivial, and `G` is then called a Frobenius
group with complement `H`.

The elementwise form is the definition taken here, because it is what every proof uses; the
lattice form is `EpsilonEridani.isTISubgroup_iff_inf_conj_smul_eq_bot`.

Alongside the subgroup notion there is a set-level one.  A **trivial-intersection set** for `H` is
a subset `S ⊆ H` normalized by `H` whose distinct `G`-conjugates are pairwise disjoint.  The
example that matters is the nonidentity part `H# = (H : Set G) \ {1}` of a Frobenius complement
(`EpsilonEridani.IsFrobeniusComplement.isTISet_diff_one`).  Because the conjugates of such an `S` depend
only on the coset of the conjugator and distinct cosets give disjoint conjugates, the elements they
cover between them are indexed bijectively by the pairs (a coset of `H`, an element of `S`).  That
bijection is the `Set.ncard` identity `(Group.conjugatesOfSet S).ncard = |G : H| · |S|`
(`EpsilonEridani.IsTISet.ncard_conjugatesOfSet`), which counts the covered elements when the parametrizing
sets are finite — `H` of finite index and `S` finite — and reads `0` on an infinite side otherwise;
that count is what makes the Frobenius kernel of `EpsilonEridani/GroupTheory/FrobeniusKernel.lean` come
out with `|G : H|` elements.

A class function on `H` supported on such an `S` induces to `G` without changing its norm, as long
as the order of `G` is invertible in the coefficient field `k` (`IsUnit (Nat.card G : k)`, as
everywhere in this theory, because induction divides by that order).  That is the input to the
exceptional-character argument for Frobenius's theorem.  That induction statement is
`EpsilonEridani.characterPairing_ind_ind_of_isTISet`, in
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Induction/TrivialIntersection.lean`.

A concrete Frobenius group is normally presented the other way round, as a semidirect product
`G = N ⋊ H` with `H` acting on `N` without nonidentity fixed points, and that presentation is
enough: `EpsilonEridani.isTISubgroup_of_isComplement'_of_fixedPointFree` reads the trivial-intersection
condition off it.
Conjugation by an element `g = n · t` outside `H` is conjugation by its `H`-part `t`, which stays
inside `H`, followed by conjugation by its `N`-part `n`; so an element of `H` conjugated back into
`H` commutes with `n`, and the fixed-point hypothesis leaves only the identity.  That is the
recognition criterion a concrete Frobenius group is checked with, and
`EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.coe_eq_frobeniusKernel_of_isComplement'` completes it by identifying `N`
with the Frobenius kernel.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup`: `H` meets each of its distinct conjugates trivially.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsTISet`: `S` is a trivial-intersection set relative to `H`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFrobeniusComplement`: `H` is a proper nontrivial trivial-intersection subgroup.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isTISubgroup_iff_inf_conj_smul_eq_bot`: the lattice form of the definition.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.normalizer_eq_self`: a nontrivial trivial-intersection subgroup is
  self-normalizing.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.mem_of_conj_eq_self` and
  `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.centralizer_singleton_le`: the centralizer of a nonidentity element of a
  trivial-intersection subgroup is contained in that subgroup.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.isTISet`: an `H`-invariant subset of `H` avoiding the identity is a
  trivial-intersection set, and in particular so is the nonidentity part of `H`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsTISet.one_notMem`: conversely, a trivial-intersection set for a proper subgroup
  avoids the identity.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsTISet.ncard_conjugatesOfSet`: the `Set.ncard` identity
  `(Group.conjugatesOfSet S).ncard = |G : H| · |S|`, an actual count of the elements the conjugates
  of a trivial-intersection set cover when `H` has finite index and `S` is finite.
* `EpsilonEridani.isTISubgroup_of_isComplement'_of_fixedPointFree`: **a complement to a normal subgroup
  on which it acts without nonidentity fixed points is a trivial-intersection subgroup**, with
  `EpsilonEridani.isFrobeniusComplement_of_isComplement'_of_fixedPointFree` its bundled form for a proper
  nontrivial `H`.

## Implementation notes

The count `EpsilonEridani.IsTISet.ncard_conjugatesOfSet` is proved through a map *into* `G` out of
`(G ⧸ H) × S`, rather than through an `Equiv` onto `Group.conjugatesOfSet S`, because the two facts
it is used through are cleaner apart than bundled: that its range is the set of conjugates uses only
that `S` is normalized by `H`, while its injectivity is exactly the disjointness of the distinct
conjugates.  The coset representatives are `Quotient.out`, so the map is noncomputable and needs no
well-definedness argument; the price is that hitting a conjugate has to move a witness `x` to
`(x H).out` by `QuotientGroup.mk_out_eq_mul`, conjugating the element of `S` along the way.

/-- **A trivial-intersection set** for `H`: a subset of `H`, normalized by `H`, whose
`G`-conjugates by elements outside `H` are disjoint from it.  Since conjugation by an element of
`H` fixes `S`, the conjugates of `S` are indexed by the cosets of `H`, and the condition says that
the distinct ones are pairwise disjoint.

The motivating example is the nonidentity part `(H : Set G) \ {1}` of a trivial-intersection
subgroup (`EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.isTISet_diff_one`). -/

`Group.conjugatesOfSet S` (`EpsilonEridani.IsTISet.range_conjugatesOfSetParam`, which uses only that `S`
is normalized by `H`) and it is injective
(`EpsilonEridani.IsTISet.conjugatesOfSetParam_injective`, which is exactly the disjointness of the

assumed — but this is an `ncard` identity, and it counts elements only when the parametrizing sets
are finite, `H` of finite index and `S` finite: an infinite side otherwise reads as the junk value
`0` that `Set.ncard` and `Subgroup.index` take on infinite arguments.  The Frobenius kernel count
