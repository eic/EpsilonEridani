# The Frobenius kernel, its size, and the free action of the complement on it

The **Frobenius kernel** of a subgroup `H` of `G` is the identity together with the elements of `G`
lying in no conjugate of `H`,

`frobeniusKernel H = {1} ∪ (G ∖ ⋃_g g H g⁻¹)`.

That union of conjugates is Mathlib's `Group.conjugatesOfSet (H : Set G)`, the set of elements
conjugate to an element of `H`.

Frobenius's theorem says that when `G` is finite and `H` is a Frobenius complement — proper,
nontrivial, and meeting each of its distinct conjugates trivially
(`EpsilonEridani.IsFrobeniusComplement`) — this set is a normal subgroup, and that is not elementary: the
known proofs go through the character theory of `G`. What *is* elementary, and is what this file
proves, is everything about the kernel except its closure under multiplication: it contains the
identity, it is closed under inversion and under conjugation, it meets every conjugate of `H` only
in the identity, and — the counting statement the divisibility results below rest on — for a
finite `G` it has exactly `|G : H|` elements.

The count is the inclusion-exclusion that gives Frobenius's theorem its shape, and it is really a
statement about a trivial-intersection *set* `S` for `H` (`EpsilonEridani.IsTISet`): the conjugates
`g S g⁻¹` are pairwise disjoint for distinct cosets `g H` and depend only on the coset, so the
elements they cover are indexed bijectively by the pairs (a coset of `H`, an element of `S`) and
number `|G : H| · |S|`. That is `EpsilonEridani.IsTISet.ncard_conjugatesOfSet`, proved alongside
`EpsilonEridani.IsTISet` itself in `EpsilonEridani/GroupTheory/TrivialIntersection.lean`. The complement of the
kernel is the set of conjugates of the nonidentity elements of `H`, which for a
trivial-intersection subgroup is such a set (`EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.isTISet_diff_one`), and the
count specializes to `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.ncard_compl_frobeniusKernel`, the `Set.ncard` identity
`((frobeniusKernel H)ᶜ).ncard = |G : H| · (|H| - 1)`. That identity holds for any `G`, finite or
not, but for an infinite `G` it does not in general represent a count of elements: an infinite side
reads as the junk value `0` that `Set.ncard` and `Subgroup.index` take on infinite arguments. A
degenerate case can of course still be a genuine count — for `H = ⊥` the kernel is everything and
its complement is honestly empty — but nothing outside the finite case says so. For a finite `G`
there are indeed `|G : H| · (|H| - 1)` elements outside the kernel, and the remaining
`|G| - |G : H| · (|H| - 1) = |G : H|` elements are the kernel, and the rest is arithmetic.

Together with normality the count is exactly what makes the kernel a *complement*:
`EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.isComplement'_of_coe_eq_frobeniusKernel` says that, for a finite `G`, a
subgroup whose carrier is the Frobenius kernel is automatically a complement to `H`, so once
Frobenius's theorem supplies the subgroup, the semidirect decomposition `G = N ⋊ H` is free.
Nothing here asserts that a subgroup with that carrier exists.

The count has an arithmetic refinement, proved here as well: the conjugation action of `H` on the
nonidentity part of the kernel is **free** (`EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.stabilizer_eq_bot`, with
`EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.isCancelSMul` its typeclass form), and freeness against the `|G : H| - 1`
nonidentity kernel elements gives

`|H| ∣ |G : H| - 1`

(`EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.card_dvd_index_sub_one`), whence also `|H|` and `|G : H|` are coprime
(`EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.coprime_card_index`) and, for a proper `H`, `|H| < |G : H|`
(`EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.card_lt_index`).  When Frobenius's theorem supplies the kernel as a
subgroup `N` of order `|G : H|`, these are the classical statements that `|H|` divides `|N| - 1`
and that a Frobenius complement and a Frobenius kernel have coprime orders.  Freeness has a second
reading, bounding the centralizers the other way round: the centralizer of a nonidentity element
of the kernel is contained in the kernel
(`EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.centralizer_singleton_subset_frobeniusKernel`).

The last section runs the recognition in the other direction.  A semidirect decomposition
`G = N ⋊ H` in which `H` acts on `N` with no nonidentity fixed points forces `H` to be a
trivial-intersection subgroup (`EpsilonEridani.isTISubgroup_of_isComplement'_of_fixedPointFree`), and
then the given `N` is already the Frobenius kernel
(`EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.coe_eq_frobeniusKernel_of_isComplement'`) -- the inclusion
`N ⊆ frobeniusKernel H` needs only normality and disjointness, and the count above turns it into
an equality.  Nothing there is character theory: it is what a concrete Frobenius group is checked
against once Frobenius's theorem has produced its kernel abstractly.

No subgroup hypothesis beyond `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup` is needed for the count once `G` is finite, and
the two degenerate cases are honest instances rather than exclusions:
`frobeniusKernel ⊤ = {1}` has one element and `⊤` has index `1`, while `frobeniusKernel ⊥` is
everything and `⊥` has index `|G|`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.frobeniusKernel`: the identity together with the elements in no conjugate of `H`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.mem_frobeniusKernel`: membership, elementwise.
* `EpsilonEridani.inv_mem_frobeniusKernel_iff` and `EpsilonEridani.conj_mem_frobeniusKernel_iff`: the kernel is
  closed under inversion and invariant under conjugation, for every subgroup `H`.
* `EpsilonEridani.frobeniusKernel_inter_conj_smul_eq_singleton` and
  `EpsilonEridani.frobeniusKernel_inter_eq_singleton`: the kernel meets every conjugate of `H`, and in
  particular `H` itself, exactly in the identity.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.ncard_compl_frobeniusKernel`: the `Set.ncard` identity
  `((frobeniusKernel H)ᶜ).ncard = |G : H| · (|H| - 1)`, which for a finite `G` counts the elements
  *outside* the kernel — the nonidentity elements of the conjugates of `H`, each counted once — and
  for an infinite `G` reads `0 = 0`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.ncard_frobeniusKernel` and
  `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.natCard_frobeniusKernel`: **for a finite `G` the kernel has `|G : H|`
  elements.**
* `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.isComplement'_of_coe_eq_frobeniusKernel`: for a finite `G`, a subgroup
  whose carrier is the kernel is a complement to `H`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.conj_ne_self_of_mem_frobeniusKernel`,
  `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.stabilizer_eq_bot` and `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.isCancelSMul`: a nonidentity
  element of `H` commutes with no nonidentity element of the kernel, so the conjugation action of
  `H` on the nonidentity part of the kernel is **free**.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.mem_frobeniusKernel_of_conj_eq_self` and
  `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.centralizer_singleton_subset_frobeniusKernel`: the centralizer of a
  nonidentity element of the kernel is contained in the kernel.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.card_dvd_index_sub_one`: **`|H| ∣ |G : H| - 1`** for a finite `G`, with
  `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.coprime_card_index` the coprimality and
  `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.card_lt_index` the strict inequality `|H| < |G : H|` it implies.
* `EpsilonEridani.isTISubgroup_of_isComplement'_of_fixedPointFree`: **a complement to a normal subgroup
  on which it acts without nonidentity fixed points is a trivial-intersection subgroup**, with
  `EpsilonEridani.isFrobeniusComplement_of_isComplement'_of_fixedPointFree` its bundled form for a proper
  nontrivial `H`.
* `EpsilonEridani.coe_subset_frobeniusKernel` and
  `EpsilonEridani.IsTISubgroup.coe_eq_frobeniusKernel_of_isComplement'`: **a normal complement meeting
  `H` trivially lies in the Frobenius kernel, and for a finite `G` it *is* the Frobenius
  kernel** when `H` is a trivial-intersection subgroup.

a Frobenius complement `H`, Frobenius's theorem makes the kernel a subgroup `N` of order `|G : H|`,
so this is the classical `|H| ∣ |N| - 1`
