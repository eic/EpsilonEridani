# Characters of a cyclic group read off a `ZMod` coordinate

A group `H` presented as cyclic of order `m` by a coordinate `e : H ≃* Multiplicative (ZMod m)`
has its characters named by the `m`-th roots of unity: the character attached to `ζ` sends the
element with coordinate `i` to `ζ ^ i`. This file reads Mathlib's `AddChar.zmodChar` through such
a coordinate to get `MulEquiv.zmodCoordChar`, and shows that a *primitive* root of unity gives a
faithful character.

The coordinate is data, not merely the existence of `IsCyclic H`: the character depends on which
generator `e` names, a different coordinate permuting the characters among themselves. Concrete
cyclic subgroups come with a preferred coordinate -- the rotation subgroup of a dihedral or a
generalized quaternion group, for instance -- and the characters used there are the
specializations of this one.

## Main definitions

* `MulEquiv.zmodCoordChar`: the character sending the element with coordinate `i` to `ζ ^ i`, for
  `ζ` an `m`-th root of unity.

## Main results

* `MulEquiv.zmodCoordChar_injective`: the character attached to a *primitive* `m`-th root of unity
  is faithful.
