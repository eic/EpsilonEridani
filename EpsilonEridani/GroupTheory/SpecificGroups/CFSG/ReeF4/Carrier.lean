# The ambient group of the Ree family of type `F₄`

The Ree family `²F₄(2^(2m+1))` is built inside the group of algebraic-closure-valued points of
the short-root type-`F₄` carrier over the prime field `𝔽₂`: the closed subgroup scheme of `GL₂₆`
generated over `𝔽₂` by the reductions of the numbered simple root subgroups and of the weight
torus of the Kostant toral closure of the twenty-six-dimensional module `V(ϖ₄)`. This file
attaches that carrier to a validated Ree index of type `F₄`, and supplies the numbered simple
root subgroups and the two Frobenius endomorphisms the family's construction runs against.

The carrier is taken over `𝔽₂` rather than over `ℤ` because the exceptional isogeny defining the
family's Steinberg map lives in characteristic two. Realizing that isogeny as an endomorphism of
the carrier needs the defining Hopf ideal to be the largest one killed by the generator
coordinate maps *over `𝔽₂`*; the base change of the integral toral closure is only known to contain
the carrier, new equations being possible over a base that is not flat.

## The two Frobenius maps

`EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.frobenius` is the `q`-power Frobenius, for `q = 2^(2m+1)` the field order
the index records, and `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.primeFrobenius` is the `2`-power one; the former is
the `(2m+1)`-st power of the latter, `frobenius_eq_primeFrobenius_pow`.

Neither is the family's Steinberg endomorphism. In the literature that map is an odd power of an
exceptional isogeny of the carrier, available only in characteristic two and exchanging the two
root lengths, rather than a Frobenius (Steinberg, §11). The two maps here are named after what they
are.
`EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.mem_fixedSubgroup_frobenius_iff` describes the group the `q`-power one
fixes: the points whose matrix entries lie in the field of definition `𝔽_q`.

The carrier is numbered by the Bourbaki numbering of the `F₄` diagram that the index itself
carries: the character by which the carrier's split torus rescales the parameter of its `i`-th
numbered raising subgroup is `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.rootGeneratorWeight` at `.inl i`, which
`EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.rootGeneratorWeight_eq_root_simpleIndex` identifies with the `i`-th simple
root of `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum` at `F₄`. No renumbering adapter is needed,
and every numbered object below is indexed by `Fin d.1.rank`, the upstream Bourbaki index type of
the index's own Dynkin type.

The carrier is not identified with the pinned simply connected group scheme of type `F₄`, and the
constructions below transfer to that group scheme only along such an identification, once one is
proved. Nothing here asserts that the carrier is reductive, that its weight torus is maximal, or
that any group below is finite, perfect, or simple.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.AmbientGroup`: the algebraic-closure-valued points of the carrier, with
  the group structure it inherits as a subgroup of `GL₂₆`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.simpleRootSubgroup`: its positive simple-root subgroup at a
  Bourbaki-numbered node.
* `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.frobenius` and `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.primeFrobenius`: the `q`-power and
  `2`-power Frobenius endomorphisms of the ambient group.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.rootGeneratorWeight_eq_root_simpleIndex`: the character by which the
  carrier's torus rescales the parameter of the `i`-th simple-root subgroup is the `i`-th simple
  root of the `F₄` root datum, in the same Bourbaki numbering.
* `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.frobenius_simpleRootSubgroup` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.primeFrobenius_simpleRootSubgroup`: both Frobenius maps fix the numbering
  of a simple-root subgroup and raise its parameter, `Frob_q (x_i(u)) = x_i(u ^ q)` and
  `Frob_2 (x_i(u)) = x_i(u ^ 2)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.frobenius_eq_primeFrobenius_pow`: the `q`-power Frobenius is the
  `(2m+1)`-st power of the `2`-power one.
* `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.mem_fixedSubgroup_frobenius_iff`: the `q`-power Frobenius fixes exactly
  the points whose matrix entries lie in the field of definition.

/-! ## The ambient group and its simple root subgroups -/

/-- **The ambient group this file attaches to a validated Ree index of type `F₄`**: the points,
over the algebraic closure of the prime field, of the short-root type-`F₄` carrier over `𝔽₂`. It
is a subgroup of `GL₂₆` over that closure.

It is infinite, and it is the same group for every Ree index of type `F₄`, the parameter `m`
entering only through the endomorphism whose fixed points are taken. No finiteness, reductivity,
pinning or maximality statement is attached to it, and it is not identified with the points of the
pinned simply connected `F₄` group scheme. -/
abbrev AmbientGroup : Type := F4ShortRoot.PrimeField.points d.1.Closure

/-- The classification recipe runs its fixed-point and quotient construction inside this group, so
it carries a group structure; the carrier being a subgroup of a general linear group supplies
it. -/
example : Group d.AmbientGroup := inferInstance

/-- The positive simple-root subgroup at the Bourbaki-numbered node `i` of the `F₄` diagram. It is
the carrier's numbered raising subgroup at the same node, the index type `Fin d.1.rank` being the
upstream Bourbaki index type of the index's own Dynkin type. -/

-- are the normal forms the equations of this file are stated against, and unfolding to
-- `EpsilonEridani.F4ShortRoot.PrimeField.rootSubgroupPoints` would keep them from firing.
/-- The simple-root subgroup is the carrier's numbered raising subgroup at the corresponding node.
This is the equation through which the upstream root-subgroup API reaches `simpleRootSubgroup`. -/

/-- **The simple-root subgroups sit at the simple roots of the `F₄` root datum.** The character by
which the carrier's split weight torus rescales the parameter of `simpleRootSubgroup i` is the
`i`-th simple root of `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum` at `F₄`, in the same Bourbaki
numbering; `EpsilonEridani.F4ShortRoot.weightTorusPoints_conj_rootSubgroupPoints_root_simpleIndex` is the
carrier-level conjugation equation this character governs. This is the sense in which the carrier
serves the diagram the index names; it is not a claim that the carrier is the pinned group of that
diagram, no pinning being constructed for it. -/

/-- **The `q`-power Frobenius endomorphism of the ambient group of a Ree index of type `F₄`**, for
`q = 2^(2m+1)` the field order the index records.

It is not the family's Steinberg endomorphism, which is an odd power of an exceptional isogeny
rather than a Frobenius. -/
