# The index of the Ree family of type `F₄`

`EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex` names the Ree family of type `F₄` by its constructor `reeF4 m`, whose
field order is `2 ^ (2m+1)`. This file selects that constructor and validates it, giving the
restricted index domain `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex` on which the family's carrier, Steinberg
endomorphism and candidate group are built, together with the numerical facts a consumer of that
domain needs: its diagram is `F₄`, its rank is four, its characteristic is two, and its field
order is at least eight.

The last of those is the index-level shape of the exclusion of `m = 0`. That parameter would name
`²F₄(2)`, which is not on the classification list: it is not simple, its derived subgroup being
the Tits group `²F₄(2)'`, which the list carries under the separate constructor `tits`. So a
`ReeF4LieIndex` always has `1 ≤ m`, hence field order `2 ^ (2m+1) ≥ 8`.

The rank-four diagram `F₄` has two long and two short simple roots, Bourbaki nodes `1` and `2`
being the long ones. The exceptional isogeny of characteristic two exchanges the two lengths, and
`EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.exponent_eq` records the resulting exponents at the four numbered nodes as
a worked consequence of the root-length predicate of `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType`, not as a second table.

The selector is a constructor test, not a mathematical property of a group. Nothing here asserts
that a named group is finite or simple.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex.IsReeF4`: the constructor selector, with
  `EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex.isReeF4_iff_exists` naming the constructor and its parameter.
* `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex`: a validated index in the family.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.exists_eq_of`: the eliminator matching the introduction form.
* `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.dynkinType_eq`, `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.rank_eq_four` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.characteristic_eq_two`: the diagram, rank and characteristic.
* `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.eight_le_fieldOrder`: the field order is at least eight.
* `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.fieldOrder_eq_two_pow`: the field order is two to the recorded exponent.
* `EpsilonEridani.ReeF4LieIndex.exponent_eq`: the exceptional isogeny raises the parameter of the two
  long simple root subgroups to the first power and that of the two short ones to the second.

/-- Whether a Lie-type index names the Ree family of type `F₄`, `²F₄(2^(2m+1))`.

This is a constructor selector, not a mathematical property of a group. It is false on the Tits
constructor, which shares the `F₄` diagram and the characteristic-two exceptional isogeny but is
listed under its own name; the exclusion of `²F₄(2)` comes from the enclosing
`EpsilonEridani.ValidLieTypeIndex`. No finiteness or simplicity is asserted here. -/

/-- **The selector names the Ree type-`F₄` constructor**: an index satisfies it exactly when it is
`reeF4 m` for a parameter `m`, which is the form a consumer holding an abstract index needs. -/

/-- A validated index in the Ree family of type `F₄`, `²F₄(2^(2m+1))`.

The outer subtype is important: `²F₄(2)`, the parameter `m = 0`, is excluded from the
classification list, since it is not simple and its derived subgroup is the Tits group, so
`²F₄(2)` is not a `ReeF4LieIndex`. The Tits group itself, the Suzuki family `²B₂` and the Ree
family `²G₂` are excluded too; they are the other three constructors of
`EpsilonEridani.SuzukiReeIndex`. -/
