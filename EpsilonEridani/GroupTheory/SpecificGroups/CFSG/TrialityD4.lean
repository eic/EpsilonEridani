# The triality-twisted family `³D₄(q)` on the tripled carrier

The classification list carries three families on the `D₄` diagram: the untwisted `D₄(q)`, the
graph-twisted `²D₄(q)`, and the triality-twisted `³D₄(q)`, whose Steinberg map is the `q`-power
Frobenius composed with the order-three symmetry `γ₃` of the diagram. The first two are built on
the full-weight spin carrier in `EpsilonEridani/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/TypeD.lean`. The third
needs a carrier on which triality is a linear symmetry of the representation space. Triality
permutes the three eight-dimensional representations of `D₄`, so neither the natural
representation nor the full spin module `V(ϖ₃) ⊕ V(ϖ₄)` is stable under it, and no fixed linear
automorphism of either realizes it (triality does act on the spin carrier as an abstract
automorphism, the spin representation being faithful, but not by such a matrix). The tripled
module `V(ϖ₁) ⊕ V(ϖ₃) ⊕ V(ϖ₄)` is a full-weight module that is stable. Its carrier is
`EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.groupScheme`, inside `GL₂₄` over `ℤ`, and triality acts on it by the
permutation of the twenty-four weight-basis vectors realized in
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.Lie.D4.Tripled.Triality`.

For a triality-twisted index the ambient group of the branch is the `AmbientGroup` below, on the
tripled carrier. The same index also lies in `EpsilonEridani.TypeDDiagramLieIndex`, through
`EpsilonEridani.TypeTrialityD4LieIndex.toTypeDDiagramLieIndex`, and so also reaches the spin-carrier
points `EpsilonEridani.TypeDDiagramLieIndex.AmbientGroup` and their Frobenius; those are diagram-level
data shared with the untwisted and graph-twisted families, and they are not the ambient group or
the Frobenius of the `³D₄(q)` branch, which are the ones defined here.

This file attaches that carrier to a validated `³D₄` index. It supplies the group of
algebraic-closure-valued points and the Bourbaki-numbered simple root subgroups, identifies the
character of those subgroups with the corresponding simple root of the `D₄` root datum, and builds
the two factors of the Steinberg map and their composite:

```text
Frob_q (x_i(u)) = x_i(u ^ q),      γ₃ (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u),      F = γ₃ ∘ Frob_q = Frob_q ∘ γ₃,
```

where `σ` is the diagram permutation the index itself carries, `EpsilonEridani.trialityPermD4`, with
`γ₃ ^ 3 = 1`. These are the pinning equations on the numbered simple-root subgroups; no pinning of
the carrier is constructed, and `γ₃` is characterized by them only along an identification with a
pinned group. The fixed-point recipe is then run on `F`: `FixedPoints` is the fixed subgroup and
`Group` its derived subgroup modulo the centre of that derived subgroup.

Nothing here asserts that the carrier is reductive, that its weight torus is maximal, that it is
the pinned simply connected Chevalley--Demazure group scheme of type `D₄`, or that any group
mentioned is finite, perfect, or simple. No identification of this carrier with that pinned group
scheme is constructed in this module; constructions on the carrier transfer to that group only
along such an identification, once one is proved.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.TypeTrialityD4LieIndex.AmbientGroup`: the algebraic-closure-valued points of the
  tripled carrier, the group the classification recipe for `³D₄(q)` is run inside.

  Bourbaki-numbered node.
* `EpsilonEridani.TypeTrialityD4LieIndex.rootGeneratorWeight_eq_root_simpleIndex`: the character of that
  subgroup is the corresponding simple root of `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum`.
* `EpsilonEridani.TypeTrialityD4LieIndex.frobenius`, `frobenius_simpleRootSubgroup` and
  `mem_fixedSubgroup_frobenius_iff`: the `q`-power Frobenius factor, its pinning equation, and its
  fixed points, the points with entries in `𝔽_q`.
* `EpsilonEridani.TypeTrialityD4LieIndex.graphAut`, `graphAut_simpleRootSubgroup`, `graphAut_pow_three`,
  `graphAut_pow_twistOrder` and `graphAut_comp_frobenius`: the triality factor, its pinning
  equation, its order relation, and its commutation with Frobenius.
* `EpsilonEridani.TypeTrialityD4LieIndex.steinberg`, `steinberg_def`,
  `steinberg_eq_frobenius_comp_graphAut` and `steinberg_simpleRootSubgroup`: the Steinberg map, its
  two factorizations, and its pinning equation `F (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u ^ q)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.TypeTrialityD4LieIndex.FixedPoints` and `EpsilonEridani.TypeTrialityD4LieIndex.Group`: the
  fixed group and its derived central quotient.

* `EpsilonEridani.TypeTrialityD4LieIndex.primeFrobenius`, with
  `EpsilonEridani.TypeTrialityD4LieIndex.primeFrobenius_simpleRootSubgroup` and
  `EpsilonEridani.TypeTrialityD4LieIndex.frobenius_eq_primeFrobenius_pow`: the prime-field Frobenius, its
  pinned equation `Frob_p (x_i(u)) = x_i(u ^ p)`, and the `q`-power Frobenius as its `e`-th
  power.

/-! ## The ambient group and its simple root subgroups -/

/-- **The ambient group this file attaches to a validated `³D₄` index**: the points of the explicit
tripled type-`D₄` Chevalley carrier over the algebraic closure of its prime field. No finiteness,
reductivity, pinning or maximality statement is attached to it, and it is not claimed to be the
points of the pinned simply connected `D₄` group scheme, no identification with that group being
constructed in this module. -/
abbrev AmbientGroup : Type := D4Tripled.points d.1.Closure

/-- The fixed-point recipe runs inside this group, so it carries a group structure; the carrier
being a subgroup of a general linear group supplies it. -/
example : Group d.AmbientGroup := inferInstance

/-- The positive simple-root subgroup at the Bourbaki-numbered node `i` of the `D₄` diagram. It is
the carrier's numbered raising subgroup at the same node, the index type `Fin d.1.rank` being the
upstream Bourbaki index type of the index's own Dynkin type. -/
def simpleRootSubgroup (i : Fin d.1.rank) : Multiplicative d.1.Closure →* d.AmbientGroup :=

/-- The simple-root subgroup is the carrier's numbered raising subgroup at the corresponding node.
This is the equation through which the upstream root-subgroup API reaches `simpleRootSubgroup`,
whose definition itself stays sealed.

It is deliberately not a `simp` lemma: the pinning equations `γ₃ (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u)` and
`Frob_q (x_i(u)) = x_i(u ^ q)` below are stated against `simpleRootSubgroup` itself, and unfolding
to `EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.rootSubgroupPoints` would keep them from firing. -/

/-- **The simple-root subgroups sit at the simple roots of the `D₄` root datum.** The character by
which the carrier's split torus rescales the parameter of `simpleRootSubgroup i`, given by
`EpsilonEridani.D4Tripled.weightTorusPoints_conj_rootSubgroupPoints`, is the `i`-th simple root of
`EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum` at the Dynkin type the index names, in the same
Bourbaki numbering. It is not a claim that the carrier is the pinned group of that diagram, no
pinning being constructed for it. -/
