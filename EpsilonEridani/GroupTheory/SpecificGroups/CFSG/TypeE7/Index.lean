# The index of the exceptional family `E₇(q)`

The classification list carries a single family on the `E₇` diagram, the untwisted `E₇(q)`: the
diagram is a tree with no nontrivial symmetry, so there is no graph automorphism to twist a
Steinberg map by and no partner family beside it.

This file cuts that family out of `EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex` with the constructor selector
`EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex.IsTypeE7` and the subtype `EpsilonEridani.TypeE7LieIndex` of validated indices
satisfying it, and reads off the numbered data such an index carries: its Dynkin type is `E₇` and
its rank is seven. Every `E₇` parameter is valid, so the family contributes one classification
entry for each prime power.

Nothing here mentions a group: these are selectors on the index datatype, matching the type-`E₆`
index API of `EpsilonEridani/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/Index.lean`. The carrier the family is built
on is attached to such an index in
`EpsilonEridani/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/TypeE7/Basic.lean`, and the diagram permutation its
Steinberg map composes with in `EpsilonEridani/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/GraphTwisted.lean`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex.IsTypeE7`: the constructor selector for the family.
* `EpsilonEridani.TypeE7LieIndex`: the subtype of validated indices it cuts out, with the introduction
  form `EpsilonEridani.TypeE7LieIndex.of` and the matching eliminator
  `EpsilonEridani.TypeE7LieIndex.exists_eq_of`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex.valid_E7`: every `E₇` parameter is a preferred classification
  representative.
* `EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex.not_usesHalfFrobenius_of_isTypeE7`: an `E₇` index takes an ordinary
  Steinberg map, so it is one of `EpsilonEridani.GraphTwistedIndex`.
* `EpsilonEridani.TypeE7LieIndex.dynkinType_eq` and `EpsilonEridani.TypeE7LieIndex.rank_eq_seven`: the family is
  built on the diagram `E₇`, of rank seven.

## References

* R. W. Carter, *Simple Groups of Lie Type*, §14, for the classification list this index ranges
  over.

/-- Whether a Lie-type index names the untwisted exceptional family `E₇(q)`.

This is a constructor selector, not a mathematical property of a group: it asserts no finiteness
and no simplicity. Unlike `EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex.IsTypeE6`, it has no graph-twisted counterpart to
be distinguished from, the `E₇` diagram having no nontrivial symmetry. -/

/-- **Every `E₇(q)` index is valid.** The `E₇` row of `EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex.InStandardRange` is
unrestricted, and no `E₇` parameter is a duplicate representative, so the family contributes one
classification entry for each prime power. -/

/-- A validated index in the exceptional family `E₇(q)`.

Every `E₇(q)` is valid, by `EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex.valid_E7`, so the outer subtype excludes nothing
here; it is retained because the carrier-valued constructions of the family take
`EpsilonEridani.ValidLieTypeIndex`. -/
