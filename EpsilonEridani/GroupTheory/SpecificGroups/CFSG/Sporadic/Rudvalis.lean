# A transcribed presentation of the Rudvalis group

This file carries the `Ru` row of the sporadic presentation data required by milestone S1 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`. It records Leonard Soicher's `tcenum` presentation of
the Rudvalis group as a `EpsilonEridani.GroupPresentation`, together with its exact source, generator
convention, transcription notes, expected counts, and decidable checks on the transcription.

The complete presentation is

```text
⟨u, v, t | v², t², u⁴, (uv)⁷, (u²v)³, [t,vuv], [t,u⁻¹vu],
           (ut)¹⁰, (uvut)¹³,
           (u[t,u⁻¹][u⁻²tu²,[u⁻¹,t]])³,
           (u(uv)⁻¹t(uv)(tu²)⁴(uv)⁻¹tuv)²,
           (uvtv[(uv)⁻¹tuv,u]²)² ⟩,
```

where `[r,s] = r⁻¹s⁻¹rs`. Bradley, Curtis, and Malik deduce an ordinary presentation
from their symmetric construction of `Ru`; Soicher's `tcenum` artifact supplies the exact list
above and cites that paper as its reference.

The `tcenum` format has five sections. Its first two sections list all generators `uvt` and mark
only `u` as not known to be an involution, which contributes the implicit relators `v²` and `t²`.
The third section lists generators of the subgroup used for coset enumeration and contributes no
relator. The fourth section is empty, so it contributes no Coxeter relations. The ten words in the
fifth section are the remaining relators. The source's parser expands a commutator as
`r⁻¹s⁻¹rs`, so source commutators are represented using `Relator.comm (.inv r) (.inv s)`.
The proved `EpsilonEridani.Relator.toWord_toFreeGroup` theorem is the audit boundary between these
structured expressions and the signed words used by `PresentedGroup`.

The source artifact also gives subgroup generators for enumeration over `²F₄(2)`. They are not
part of the abstract presentation and are therefore recorded in the metadata but not inserted as
relations. An independent line-by-line read-through against the pinned source file and its pinned
`tcfrontend.c` parser found an exact match after the parser's documented involution normalization.
The parser's alphabet is `1 = u`, `2 = v = v⁻¹`, `3 = t = t⁻¹`, and `4 = u⁻¹`; after putting its
implicit `v²` and `t²` relations first, its ten explicit outputs are the signed words in
`EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.ruPresentation_relatorLetters`. This closes the source-to-Lean read-through for
the row. The separate `FiniteSimpleGroups` cross-check does not apply because that development does
not cover `Ru`. This file asserts no order, finiteness, simplicity, or identification result.

## The letter counts

Further decidable checks accompany the count check on the transcribed data. The lengths of the
compiled relator words, one at a time and in aggregate, record the transcription as written, so a
dropped or duplicated letter shows up at the relator that carries it. Exactly one of those words is
not reduced: in the twelfth relator, the tenth source word `(uvtv[(uv)⁻¹tuv,u]²)²`, each of the two
halves puts the `v` ending its prefix `uvtv` against the `v⁻¹` that opens `[(uv)⁻¹tuv,u]`, and those
two cancelling pairs are the four letters by which the compiled count `290` exceeds the reduced
count `286`. Free reduction leaves every relator cyclically reduced, which is what makes the reduced
figure the one comparable with a published presentation length, since such a length is measured
after free and cyclic reduction.

No length is recorded to compare it with: none of the five `tcenum` sections described above carries
a letter count, and Bray's presentation page for `Ru`, which in any case describes a different
two-generator presentation, prints `Length ??`. The figures below therefore state the transcribed
data for a reviewer to compare with the source, rather than checking it against a recorded number.

## Main definitions and results

* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.ruPresentation`: Soicher's finite presentation of the Rudvalis group `Ru`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.ruPresentation_transcribed` and the equations for the remaining fields: the
  characterization of the sealed row.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.ruPresentation_relatorLetters`: the twelve compiled words checked against the
  pinned parser output in the independent source-to-Lean read-through.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.ruPresentation_map_length_relators` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.ruPresentation_totalLength`: the letter counts of the compiled words.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.ruPresentation_map_length_reduce_relators` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.ruPresentation_reducedTotalLength`: the same counts after free reduction.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.isCyclicallyReduced_reduce_of_mem_ruPresentation_relators`: the reduced words
  are cyclically reduced.

/-- The twelve compiled relator words for `Ru`, spelled out in the order recorded by the Lean row.
A letter `(i, true)` is generator `i` and `(i, false)` is its inverse, so indices `0`, `1`, and `2`
are `u`, `v`, and `t`.

This is the independent source-to-Lean read-through artifact. Running the pinned source's
`tcfrontend.c` on `presentations/Ru` emits the final ten words below with `1 = u`,
`2 = v = v⁻¹`, `3 = t = t⁻¹`, and `4 = u⁻¹`; its involution table supplies the leading `v²` and
`t²` words. The lists below preserve the formal inverse signs that the parser deliberately
collapses for `v` and `t`; applying that documented normalization reproduces its output exactly. -/
