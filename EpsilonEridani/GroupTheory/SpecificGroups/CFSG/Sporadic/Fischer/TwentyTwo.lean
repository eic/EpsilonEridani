# A transcribed presentation of the first Fischer group

This file carries the `Fi₂₂` row of the sporadic presentation data required by milestone S1 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`. It records the ATLAS presentation on the standard
generators `a` and `b` as a `EpsilonEridani.GroupPresentation`, together with its exact source, generator
convention, transcription notes, expected counts, and the decidable count check.

The thirteen relators are

```text
a², b¹³, (ab)¹¹, (ab²)²¹,
[a,b]³, [a,b²]³, [a,b³]³, [a,b⁴]², [a,b⁵]³,
[a,bab²]³, [a,b⁻¹ab⁻²]², [a,bab⁵]², [a,b²ab⁵]².
```

The source's commutator convention is `[r,s] = r⁻¹s⁻¹rs`, opposite to Mathlib's
`commutatorElement`, so each commutator is stored as `Relator.comm (.inv r) (.inv s)` as
`EpsilonEridani.Relator` prescribes. The proved `EpsilonEridani.Relator.toWord_toFreeGroup` is the audit boundary
between these expressions and the signed words consumed by `PresentedGroup`.

The presentation source is backed by a computation for the double cover `2·Fi₂₂`. Its twelve
base relators present the double cover, with central involution represented by both `(ab²)²¹` and
`(ab ab ab⁻³)⁵`; adjoining either as a relator kills that involution and gives `Fi₂₂`. The ATLAS
source records that the coset enumeration over the displayed involution centralizer works with
either choice, while the version 3 presentation page chooses `(ab²)²¹` as transcribed here.

As an independent check, GAP 4.15.1 with AtlasRep 2.1.9 evaluates all thirteen displayed relators
to the identity on the ATLAS standard generators in the 3510-point permutation representation of
`Fi₂₂`. This is transcription provenance rather than a Lean theorem: the file asserts no order,
finiteness, simplicity, or identification result. The separate comparison with the
`FiniteSimpleGroups` development named by the roadmap is recorded below.

## Independent source-to-Lean read-through

An independent read-through used three pinned source artifacts. The version 3 presentation page
has SHA-256 `3c1d7e85ff959ca95fc97e59b6ee0418f99c43e14bc67dfca18987cd0497d8be`; the Magma files
`F22G1-P1.M` and `2F22G1-P1.M` have respective SHA-256 digests
`a7931cf8f277196341023a229924c084c96b0b465e4893f1eb36ba47144cc027` and
`29a4f5af0e3c545271de76323012e6c1a4c20d252a354e3e7ab2affd70fd3029`.

The presentation page displays the thirteen relators in the exact order shown at the start of this
module, and every generator, inverse, commutator argument, and exponent agrees with
`fi22Presentation_transcribed`. The apparent difference in the Magma file is deliberate:
`F22G1-P1.M` comments out

```text
(xy²)²¹
```

as `R1`, activates `(xyxyxy⁻³)⁵` as `R2`, and explicitly says that exactly one of `R1` and `R2`
is needed. The double-cover file contains the common twelve base relators and records that these
two words represent the same central involution of `2·Fi₂₂`; killing either gives the simple-group
presentation. Thus the version 3 page's choice of `R1`, the omission of `R2`, and all twelve
remaining source-order positions agree exactly with the sealed Lean row. This comparison was
performed from the pinned source bytes independently of the original transcription and closes
this row's S1 source-to-Lean read-through.

## Independent comparison with `FiniteSimpleGroups`

The comparison used `finite-simple-groups-lean` at commit
`7f09e33a9ceef6b59ce03e34cd4f0558c763e325`, whose named permutations `fi22a` and `fi22b`
generate a subgroup of `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3510)` with proved order `64561751654400` and proved
simplicity. Both generators have order `13`, so they are not the ATLAS standard pair used by this
row.

The independent ATLAS 3510-point standard pair is given by the files `F22G1-p3510B0.g1` and
`F22G1-p3510B0.g2`. It has orders `2` and `13`, with product of order `11`, and the two files have
respective SHA-256 digests
`5b15ea3939461e4e74cfa544458d32256f4fc8bc1d77a90686863a29e9f09068` and
`af06024803596bb7f21cf90c577a9a1ed52abacd5b77affb320768d997bc0443`. The pinned pair and the
ATLAS pair each determine the same rank-three graph: their point stabilizer suborbits have lengths
`1`, `693`, and `2816`, with the length-`693` orbit as the neighbor set. Canonically labeling these
graphs with pynauty transports the ATLAS pair into the pinned development's point numbering.
Direct permutation calculation then gives orders `2`, `13`, and `11` for `a`, `b`, and `ab`, and
all thirteen compiled relators in this module evaluate to the identity. Schreier--Sims membership
checks put the transported `a,b` in the pinned subgroup and put `fi22a,fi22b` back in `⟨a,b⟩`; the
pair therefore generates that subgroup of order `64561751654400`.

The check used Python 3.14.6, pynauty 2.8.8.1, and SymPy 1.14.0. Concatenating the transported
forward image tables for `a` and then `b`, with each image stored as a two-byte little-endian
integer, has SHA-256
`66941048d1dd4532444563d0526fb210e2007d31ee8c58c51a9c8e1e8d7061de`. This is the independent
comparison artifact required by S1; no external code or permutation data is imported into Tau
Ceti.

The row is a sealed definition, so it publishes an equation for each of its fields: the transcribed
relator expressions with their generator indices written out, and the provenance a manifest row
exists to record. Together with `EpsilonEridani.GroupPresentation.relators_def` and
`EpsilonEridani.GroupPresentation.mem_relatorSet_iff` the first of those determines the compiled words and
the relations defining the presented group, so a consumer reasons about the row without unfolding
it.

Three decidable checks accompany those equations. The relator lengths and their total record the
compiled data one word at a time and in aggregate. Cyclic reducedness shows that cyclic reduction
does not shorten any of these relators, so `328` is also their post-reduction total. The ATLAS page
records no length for this presentation, so the total here states the transcription for a reviewer
to compare with the source, rather than checking it against a recorded number.

## Main definitions and results

* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.fi22Presentation`: the ATLAS finite presentation of `Fi₂₂`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.fi22Presentation_transcribed` and the equations for the remaining fields: the
  characterization of the sealed row.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.fi22Presentation_map_length_relators`,
  `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.fi22Presentation_totalLength` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.fi22Presentation_relatorsCyclicallyReduced`: the three checks on the compiled
  words.
