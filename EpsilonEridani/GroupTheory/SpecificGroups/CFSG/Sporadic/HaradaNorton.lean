# A transcribed presentation of the Harada--Norton group

This file carries the `HN` row of the sporadic presentation data required by milestone S1 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`. It records the corrected five-generator presentation of
the Harada--Norton group given by Bray and Curtis as a `EpsilonEridani.GroupPresentation`, together with
its source, generator convention, transcription notes, characteristic equations, and decidable
checks on the compiled and freely reduced relator words.

The nineteen relators are

```text
a⁴, [a²,b], b⁷, (ab²)⁴, a⁻²(abab³)³, ((ab)³ab⁻³)²,
c²a², [a,c], [bab,c], (bab³c)³,
d², (ad)², [b,d], d^(cbcb⁻¹)(cd)³,
t⁵, t^a t², t^c t⁻², [t,b], (dt)³.
```

Here `[r,s] = r⁻¹s⁻¹rs` and `r^s = s⁻¹rs`, following the Magma source. Mathlib's
`commutatorElement` uses the opposite commutator convention, so a source commutator is represented
by `Relator.comm (.inv r) (.inv s)`. Conjugates are expanded directly in the structured
expressions. The proved `EpsilonEridani.Relator.toWord_toFreeGroup` theorem is the audit boundary between
these expressions and the signed words consumed by `PresentedGroup`.

Section 4 of Bray--Curtis constructs `HN` as a quotient of a progenitor by coset enumeration over
the visible subgroup `2·HS:2`. Section 5 derives the five-generator presentation used here. The
authors' corrected Magma file `HNpb.m` gives the same nineteen relators exactly; in particular, it
uses `(ad)²`, correcting the preprint's `[a,d]` at that position. The source describes `c` and `d`
as generators adjoined while successively presenting `U₃(5):2` and `HS:2`, and `t` as the
order-five symmetric generator whose final relations produce `HN`.

For this audit, the source-to-Lean transcription was independently read against the first
presentation in the corrected machine-readable `HNpb.m` file. All nineteen expressions agree in
order, including the conjugation convention in the fourteenth relator. The fifth compiled word has
the freely cancelling boundary `a⁻²a`; the checks below therefore record the raw total of `153`
letters alongside the freely reduced length of each relator, and prove that every reduced word is
cyclically reduced. This file asserts no order, finiteness, simplicity, or identification result.

## Independent source-to-Lean read-through

The independent read-through used the bytes of the corrected machine-readable source `HNpb.m`
whose SHA-256 digest is
`69a39c69670aa28dd28f2b3c9ec8f44c35086174d97ba4fc073a16ad7ecec596`. The first constructor is
`G<a,b,c,d,t>`, fixing exactly the generator names and order used by the Lean row. Reading that
constructor from top to bottom gives

```text
a⁴, [a²,b], b⁷, (ab²)⁴, a⁻²(abab³)³, ((ab)³ab⁻³)²,
c²a², [a,c], [bab,c], (bab³c)³,
d², (ad)², [b,d], d^(cbcb⁻¹)(cd)³,
t⁵, t^a t², t^c t⁻², [t,b], (dt)³.
```

These are exactly the nineteen entries of `hnPresentation_transcribed`. In particular, the Lean
row preserves the corrected twelfth word `(ad)²`; expands the Magma conjugates using
`r^s = s⁻¹rs`, including the full conjugator `cbcb⁻¹` in the fourteenth word; and uses the source
commutator `[r,s] = r⁻¹s⁻¹rs`. The same file contains a second nineteen-relator constructor whose
only changed entry is the fifth, replaced there by `[a,b³]³`; the row explicitly transcribes the
first presentation and therefore correctly retains `a⁻²(abab³)³`. There are no commented or
optional entries inside that first constructor. This checks every source relator, inverse,
exponent, conjugation boundary, and constructor boundary independently of the original
transcription and closes this row's S1 source-to-Lean read-through.
