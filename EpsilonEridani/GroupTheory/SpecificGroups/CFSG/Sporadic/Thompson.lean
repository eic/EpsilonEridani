# A transcribed presentation of the Thompson sporadic simple group

This file carries one row of the sporadic presentation manifest: the finite presentation of the
Thompson group `Th` on eight generators determined by Havas, Soicher and Wilson, transcribed into
the auditable format of `EpsilonEridani.GroupPresentation`. The row records the generator names, the
source and a locator inside it, the source's generator and commutator conventions, the
transcription notes, and the generator and relator counts, together with the relator expressions
themselves.

The source is admissible in the sense the CFSG roadmap requires of a manifest row: it is a full
presentation of the abstract group, not a semi-presentation for recognizing generators inside an
already constructed group, and it is *proved* there to define `Th`. The proof is Theorem 3.1 of the
source, whose final step is a coset enumeration of the `143 127 000` cosets of the maximal subgroup
`³D₄(2):3`. Until that paper appeared, `Th` was the only sporadic simple group with no published
presentation for it or for its automorphism group.

## The relator groups

The source displays its relators in six numbered groups, and this file keeps that division, since
each group is what a reviewer compares against one displayed line of the source. The source also
records what the initial segments present, which is why the division is mathematically meaningful
rather than typographical.

| Group | Relators | The source's statement about it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `relatorsOne` | 14 | with generators `a, b, c, d, e` these present `U₃(3):2` |
| `relatorsTwo` | 6 | adjoining `s`, groups (1) and (2) present `³D₄(2)` |
| `relatorsThree` | 7 | adjoining `t`, groups (1) to (3) present `³D₄(2):3` |
| `relatorsFour` | 7 | with generators `a, b, c, d, e, u`, groups (1) and (4) present `G₂(3):2` |
| `relatorsFive` | 1 | `u` inverts `t`, so `u` lies outside the subgroup presented so far |
| `relatorsSix` | 4 | the remaining relators, which cut the group down to `Th` |

## The transcription conventions

The source writes an equation `w₁ = w₂` for the relator `w₁ w₂⁻¹`, which is
`EpsilonEridani.Relator.div`; it writes `w₁ ^ w₂` for `w₂⁻¹ w₁ w₂`, which is `EpsilonEridani.Relator.conj`; and
it writes `[w₁, w₂]` for `w₁⁻¹ w₂⁻¹ w₁ w₂`, which is
`EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.sourceCommutator`, that is, Mathlib's commutator applied to the two
inverses. The three conventions are pinned by `EpsilonEridani.Relator.toFreeGroup_div` (with Mathlib's
`div_eq_one`, which turns the relator `w₁ w₂⁻¹` back into the source's equation),
`EpsilonEridani.Relator.toFreeGroup_conj` and `EpsilonEridani.Relator.toFreeGroup_comm_inv_inv`, so no step
between the printed source and the free-group element used as a relation is left unstated.

## What is and is not claimed

Nothing here asserts that the presented group is nontrivial, finite or simple, that it has any
particular order, or that it is isomorphic to any other construction of the Thompson group. Those
are downstream statements that the CFSG roadmap deliberately does not ask for; what this file
supplies is a named group built from explicit, cited relator data.

The checks that are proved are transcription arithmetic. `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.presentation`
has eight generators and thirty-nine relators, split as `14 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 1 + 4` over the source's
six displayed groups. Beyond those counts, the source states a figure that the transcribed data
reproduces independently: it observes that its presentation gives a coset table with eleven columns,
which is the number of involutory generators plus twice the number of the others.
`EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.cosetTableColumns` recomputes that figure from the relator list, reading
the involutory generators off it as those carrying an explicit square relator, and
`EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.generatorsWithSquareRelator_eq` identifies those five as `a, b, c, d, e`.
A transposed or dropped power relator would show up in one of these.

The letter counts of the compiled words are checked in the same spirit. Reading them off one relator
at a time locates a discrepancy at the relator that carries it, rather than only in the total. Three
of the thirty-nine compiled words are not reduced, and all three are equations `w₁ = w₂` compiled as
`w₁ w₂⁻¹` whose two sides cancel at the junction: the last relator of group (2), and the last two of
group (6). Their five cancelling pairs are the ten letters by which the compiled count `300` exceeds
the reduced count `290`. Free reduction leaves every relator cyclically reduced, which is what makes
the reduced figure the one comparable with a published presentation length, since such a length is
measured after free and cyclic reduction.

This row records no such length: none is transcribed from the source into the metadata below, and
Bray's presentation page for `Th`, which in any case describes a different two-generator
presentation, prints `Length ??`. The figures below therefore state the transcribed data for a
reviewer to compare with the source, rather than checking it against a recorded number.

## Independent source-to-Lean read-through

An independent read-through used the PDF whose SHA-256 digest is
`4701d82bcba1f9b2db8793af9170d97269cc2a18aa3265fd92406879b0ce160e`. Theorem 3.1 displays the
following six groups of relators:

```text
(1) a², b², c², d², e², (ab)³, (ae)², (bc)³, (bd)², (be)²,
    a = (cd)⁴, (ce)², (de)³, (bcde)⁸;
(2) s⁷, [s,a], [s,b], [s,c], (sd)², [e,s] = e^(s³);
(3) t³, [t,a], [t,b], [t,c], [t,d], [t,e], s^t = s²;
(4) u² = ac, [u,a], [u,c], [u,e], (d e d^u)², [u,(ac)^b] = e,
    [u^d,(ac)^b] = u e (ac)^b u^d e c;
(5) t^u = t⁻¹;
(6) [e,u^(s²)], ac = (us)³ = [u,s]⁴,
    (d u^(s²))⁴ = a c c^d c^(d e s⁻¹) c^(d e s²).
```

Reading each source line against `relatorsOne` through `relatorsSix` found the same letters,
order, exponents, equations, conjugations, and commutators. In particular, the chained equality in
(6) becomes its two equations and no extra relation. The translation uses `.pow` for powers,
`.div` for the source's equation `w₁ = w₂`, `.conj` for `w₁ ^ w₂`, and `sourceCommutator` for the
source convention `[w₁,w₂] = w₁⁻¹w₂⁻¹w₁w₂`; the characteristic free-group lemmas cited above
check those three nontrivial notation choices. `relatorList` concatenates the six source groups in
order, and their checked lengths give `14 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 1 + 4 = 39`, with none dropped or
duplicated. This closes the row's S1 source-to-Lean read-through.

The independent `FiniteSimpleGroups` development named by the roadmap does not cover `Th`, so the
additional explicit-construction comparison does not apply to this row. The source states that
some relators are redundant, kept for clarity or to help the enumeration, so the list is
deliberately not minimal.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.genA` to `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.genU`: the source's eight letters
  as relator expressions.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.sourceCommutator`: the source's commutator convention.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.relatorsOne` to `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.relatorsSix`: the six
  displayed relator groups, and `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.relatorList`, their concatenation.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.presentation`: the transcribed row.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.generatorsWithSquareRelator`: the generators carrying an explicit
  square relator in the transcribed data.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.map_length_relators_presentation` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.totalLength_presentation`: the letter counts of the compiled words.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.map_length_reduce_relators_presentation` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.reducedTotalLength_presentation`: the same counts after free reduction.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.Thompson.isCyclicallyReduced_reduce_of_mem_presentation_relators`: the reduced
  words are cyclically reduced.

This fills one of the twenty-six rows owed by milestone S1 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`, which asks for the complete relator words of an
admissible source for each sporadic name. The source is

The source uses eight generators `a, b, c, d, e, s, t, u`, in that order, and the relator index
`Fin 8` follows it: index `0` is `a` and index `7` is `u`. -/

Mathlib's bracket, carried by `EpsilonEridani.Relator.comm`, is `⁅r, s⁆ = r s r⁻¹ s⁻¹`, so the source's
convention is Mathlib's applied to the two inverses; `EpsilonEridani.Relator.toFreeGroup_comm_inv_inv`
proves that this denotes `r⁻¹ s⁻¹ r s` in the free group. -/
