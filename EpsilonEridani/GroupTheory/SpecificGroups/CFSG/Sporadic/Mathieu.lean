# Transcribed presentations of the Mathieu groups `M₁₁`, `M₁₂` and `M₂₂`

This file carries three rows of the sporadic presentation manifest: cited finite presentations of
the Mathieu groups `M₁₁`, `M₁₂` and `M₂₂`, transcribed from published sources in which each
presentation is *proved* to define the named group. Each row is a `EpsilonEridani.GroupPresentation`, so it
records the generator names, the source and a locator inside it, the generator convention, the
transcription notes, and the generator and relator counts stated by the source, together with the
relator expressions themselves.

Four decidable checks accompany every row. The first is the generator and relator counts. The second
spells the compiled words out letter by letter, so that a reviewer comparing the Lean data with the
source never has to unfold the relator compiler. The third reads off from those letters the total
number of them, against the length published by the source. The fourth is that every compiled word
is cyclically reduced, which is what makes the letter count comparable with a published length: both
sources measure length after free and cyclic reduction of each relator.

The rows themselves are sealed definitions, so each also carries the equation that characterizes it,
spelling out its transcribed relator expressions with their generator indices. Together with
`EpsilonEridani.GroupPresentation.relators_def` and `EpsilonEridani.GroupPresentation.mem_relatorSet_iff`, and
with the interpretation equations of `EpsilonEridani.Relator.toFreeGroup`, that equation determines the
compiled words and the relations defining the presented group, so a consumer downstream of this
file reasons about a row without unfolding it. Each row likewise publishes an equation for every
one of its metadata fields — the source, the locator, the generator convention, the transcription
notes and the two counts the source states — so an audit downstream sees the provenance a manifest
row exists to record, and not merely the row's name.

## The manifest rows

| Name | Source | Locator | Generators | Relators | Length |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `M₁₁` | Campbell--Havas--Ramsay--Robertson | Table 2 row `M11`, Section 5.8 | 2 | 2 | 19 |
| `M₁₂` | Campbell--Havas--Ramsay--Robertson | Table 2 row `M12`, Section 5.17 | 2 | 3 | 29 |
| `M₂₂` | Conder--Havas--Ramsay | Section 3.4, p. 40 | 2 | 3 | 30 |

Both sources prove their presentations by coset enumeration over the trivial subgroup, and both
record the number of cosets that the enumeration used; those figures are part of the transcription
notes of each row. Each row is also an *efficient* presentation in the sense of its source, meaning
that its deficiency attains the lower bound coming from the Schur multiplier; that is the property
the sources are about, and it plays no role here beyond explaining why they list these words.

## Independent source-to-Lean read-through

The three rows were independently checked against the source PDFs, rather than against the Lean
definitions or the existing GAP re-enumeration. The downloaded bytes of Campbell--Havas--Ramsay--
Robertson's paper have SHA-256
`ab91fcb806b1bc50508100f01893dcd84825146a80027c12796db325f8cf9966`; the paper's Table 2 (p. 270)
and Sections 5.8 and 5.17 (pp. 275 and 279) give the `M₁₁` and `M₁₂` rows. The downloaded bytes of
Conder--Havas--Ramsay's paper have SHA-256
`f0cf99d0c46a8c0546e036a62ecdd4407e043c8f9e2aeba744d9db5afe9301ed`; its Section 3.4 (p. 40)
gives the `M₂₂` quotient presentation.

For `M₁₁`, the source row is

```text
b A^3 b A b^3,  b a B A B A b a B a
```

The first word expands to the nine letters in the first entry of
`m11Presentation_relatorLetters`, and the second to its ten-letter second entry. The source's
generator order is `a,b`, and its convention `A = a⁻¹`, `B = b⁻¹` agrees with the row. The table
and Section 5.8 both identify the presentation as `M₁₁`; the table reports length `19`, `10428`
cosets, and order `7920`, matching the row's letter total and transcription notes.

For `M₁₂`, the source row is

```text
(B a)^3,  a^5 b^6,  a b^2 a B a^2 b a^2 b^2
```

The first word expands to six letters, the second to eleven, and the third to twelve, in exactly
the order of `m12Presentation_relatorLetters`. The source again uses alphabetical generators and
upper-case inverses. Table 2 reports length `29`, `119334` cosets, and order `95040`; Section 5.17
describes the same row and distinguishes it from the separate covering-group presentation.

For `M₂₂`, the source's Section 3.4 starts from a presentation of the cover and then adjoins the
central relation `b^11`. The final displayed presentation is

```text
 a^4 b A b A b,  a^2 b A B a b^2 A B,  b^11
```

These expand to the three entries of `m22Presentation_relatorLetters`, of lengths `9`, `10`, and
`11`. In particular, the third word is the relation that passes from the cover to `M₂₂`; it is
not omitted as a redundant cover relation. The source uses the same `a,b` and upper-case-inverse
conventions, and reports length `30`, `2104858` cosets, and order `443520` for this presentation.

Thus every source relator, exponent, generator index, and source-order position agrees with the
corresponding sealed row and its compiled-letter theorem. This paragraph is the independent
source-to-Lean review artifact for these three rows; it is not a theorem about the order or
simplicity of any presented group.

## What is and is not claimed

Nothing in this file asserts that the presented groups are nontrivial, finite, or simple, that they
have any particular order, or that they are isomorphic to any other construction of a Mathieu
group. Those are downstream statements which the CFSG roadmap deliberately does not ask for. What is
proved here is exactly the transcription arithmetic: the counts, the total length, the compiled
letters, and cyclic reducedness.

## Cross-checks

The correctness of a transcription is a review obligation, not something these theorems establish.
Two external checks are recorded below as provenance for a reviewer. Neither is a Lean proof, and
neither is claimed by any theorem in this file.

The first is an independent re-enumeration of the transcribed words outside Lean, with GAP 4.15.1.
Transcribing the compiled letters back into GAP's free-group syntax gives the input

```text
F := FreeGroup("a", "b");;  a := F.1;;  b := F.2;;
G11 := F / [ b*a^-3*b*a^-1*b^3, b*a*b^-1*a^-1*b^-1*a^-1*b*a*b^-1*a ];;
G12 := F / [ (b^-1*a)^3, a^5*b^6, a*b^2*a*b^-1*a^2*b*a^2*b^2 ];;
G22 := F / [ a^4*b*a^-1*b*a^-1*b, a^2*b*a^-1*b^-1*a*b^2*a^-1*b^-1, b^11 ];;
List([G11, G12, G22], Size);
List([G11, G12, G22], IsSimpleGroup);
List([[G11, 11], [G12, 12], [G22, 22]], p -> IsomorphismGroups(p[1], MathieuGroup(p[2])) <> fail);
```

on which Todd--Coxeter over the trivial subgroup returns the orders `7920`, `95040` and `443520`,
each group is simple, and an isomorphism to `MathieuGroup(11)`, `MathieuGroup(12)` and
`MathieuGroup(22)` is found. That reproduces the published claim about the words as transcribed
here, and a mistyped letter would be very unlikely to survive it.

The second is the comparison the CFSG roadmap asks a sporadic row to record. It used the Lean 4
permutation-group development
[FiniteSimpleGroups](https://github.com/KitaKen1/finite-simple-groups-lean) at commit
`7f09e33a9ceef6b59ce03e34cd4f0558c763e325`, which builds `M₁₁`, `M₁₂`, and `M₂₂` as subgroups
of `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` with their orders and simplicity proved. Deterministic searches inside
those three pinned subgroups found the following images of the presentation generators, in the
development's zero-based point numbering:

```text
M11:
  a = (0 2 3 10 6 1 9 8 4 7 5)
  b = (0 4 1 5 9 8 3 6 7 10 2)
M12:
  a = (0 1 2 7 4)(3 8 10 5 6)
  b = (0 8 5)(1 6)(2 10 7 9 11 4)
M22:
  a = (0 12 11 21 10)(1 14 20 13 19)(3 16 7 18 4)(5 17 15 6 8)
  b = (0 20 10 9 14 16 15 4 13 19 1)(2 5 6 8 18 17 11 21 3 12 7).
```

Direct permutation calculation makes all two, three, and three compiled relators respectively
equal to the identity. Schreier--Sims membership checks put each displayed pair in the subgroup
generated by the pinned development's named generators and put every named generator back in the
corresponding displayed pair's subgroup. The pair-generated orders are therefore `7920`, `95040`,
and `443520`, agreeing with the pinned theorems `card_M11`, `card_M12`, and `card_M22`.

The calculation used Python 3.14.6 and SymPy 1.14.0. For each pair, concatenate the forward image
table of `a` with that of `b`, storing every image as one byte. The resulting SHA-256 values are
`5def66f046fc1d01ff2cf1878e33b9f50dc938f1b393434435df4abaa4fba119` for `M₁₁`,
`4760dae2a1c9048a473456e770425ee3163bb5f411c77e04395cea2f18531768` for `M₁₂`, and
`5e05402c13ed8ab52c3c5b5b322fcdfd76c758eea39c32dfa5da587818ff859d` for `M₂₂`. This is the
independent comparison artifact rather than a Lean theorem or imported external data; the GAP
re-enumeration above remains a separate check.

## Main definitions

  `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.m22Presentation`: the three transcribed rows.

## References

This is part of milestone S1 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`, which asks for a complete
relator word list, with an admissible source, for each of the twenty-six sporadic names. It
populates the presentation data for three of those rows and records both their independent source
read-throughs and the required comparisons against the `FiniteSimpleGroups` development. The two
presentation sources are:

  small simple groups and their covers*, LMS J. Comput. Math. **7** (2004), 266--283,

imported, copied, or adapted here.

The remaining two Mathieu names, `M₂₃` and `M₂₄`, are transcribed in the sibling modules

Both sources write relators as words in two generators `a` and `b`, with an upper-case letter
denoting an inverse, so that `A` is `a⁻¹`. The four expressions below are those four letters, and
`⬝` below is `EpsilonEridani.Relator.mul`, so a transcribed relator reads left to right exactly as the
