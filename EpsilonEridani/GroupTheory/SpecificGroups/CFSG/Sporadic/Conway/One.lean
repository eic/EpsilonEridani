# A transcribed presentation of the first Conway group

This file carries the `Co₁` row of the sporadic presentation data required by milestone S1 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`. It records presentation `GPLTable.Co1.1` from Roderik
Lindenbergh's Group Presentations Library as a `EpsilonEridani.GroupPresentation`, together with the exact
source, generator convention, transcription notes, expected counts, and decidable checks on the
transcription.

The presentation uses the Coxeter graph encoded by

```text
b4h3a3b5c3d3f4c3e4a, b4g4f, e6f6h.
```

All eight generators are involutions and every omitted edge has label two. Thus the graph
contributes eight square relations, thirteen labeled-edge relations, and fifteen omitted-edge
relations. The source then appends

```text
a = (cf)²,  e = (bg)²,  b = (ef)³,  d = (bh)²,  d = (eah)³,
(adfh)³,  (baefg)³,  (cef)⁷,  (adefcefgh)³⁹.
```

An equality `x = y` in the source is the relator `x⁻¹y`. The complete presentation therefore has
45 relators, whose compiled words have 611 signed letters. The theorems below check both figures
from the transcribed expressions.

The library identifies this record as a presentation of `Co₁` originating in Praeger--Soicher,
whose construction uses low-rank representations and graphs for sporadic groups. The stored data
is a full presentation of the abstract group, not a semi-presentation for recognizing generators
in an already constructed group. This file asserts no order, finiteness, simplicity, or
identification result.

## Independent source-to-Lean read-through

An independent read-through used the bytes of `gpl.g` whose SHA-256 digest is
`8b90a7a65317a585b5b74d015083bd2fa3db8a969c117a220d00d7e8773103c8`. The exact source record is

```text
presdef := [ "b4h3a3b5c3d3f4c3e4a,b4g4f,e6f6h", ,
    "a=(cf)^2,e=(bg)^2,b=(ef)^3,d=(bh)^2,d=(eah)^3,\
     (adfh)^3,(baefg)^3,(cef)^7,(adefcefgh)^(39)",,  ],
```

`GetGenerators` gives the decoder's first-occurrence order `b,h,a,c,d,f,e,g`; the Lean row instead
uses the alphabetical order `a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h`. After that explicit renaming, `DeCoxList` and its
calls to `AddTrivialRelations` and `AddNonEdgeRelations` give the same relation multiset recorded by
`co1Presentation_relatorLetters`, regrouped by kind. Entries 1--8 are the eight generator squares;
entries 9--21 are

```text
(ab)^3,(ae)^4,(ah)^3,(bc)^5,(bg)^4,(bh)^4,(cd)^3,
(ce)^3,(cf)^4,(df)^3,(ef)^6,(fg)^4,(fh)^6;
```

and entries 22--36 are the exponent-two nonedges

```text
ac,ad,af,ag, bd,be,bf, cg,ch, de,dg,dh, eg,eh, gh.
```

`MakeWordList` compiles an equality `x = y` as `x⁻¹y`. Entries 37--45 are therefore, in source
order, `a⁻¹(cf)²`, `e⁻¹(bg)²`, `b⁻¹(ef)³`, `d⁻¹(bh)²`, `d⁻¹(eah)³`, `(adfh)³`, `(baefg)³`,
`(cef)⁷`, and `(adefcefgh)³⁹`. There is no change to any word or exponent and no dropped or
duplicated relation, only the presentation-irrelevant renaming and regrouping just described. This
closes the row's S1 source-to-Lean read-through.

The independent `FiniteSimpleGroups` comparison does not apply: at commit
`7f09e33a9ceef6b59ce03e34cd4f0558c763e325`, that development has sporadic constructions for
`Co₂` and `Co₃` but not `Co₁`.

The row is a sealed definition, so it publishes an equation for each of its fields: the transcribed
relator expressions with their generator indices written out and this file's three private relator
lists concatenated, and the provenance a manifest row exists to record. Together with
`EpsilonEridani.GroupPresentation.relators_def` and `EpsilonEridani.GroupPresentation.mem_relatorSet_iff` the
first of those determines the compiled words and the relations defining the presented group, so a
consumer reasons about the row without unfolding it.

These field equations and the decidable checks beside them follow the shape that the
`EpsilonEridani.GroupTheory.SpecificGroups.CFSG.Sporadic.Janko` modules established for a manifest row.

## Main definitions and results

* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.co1Presentation`: the GPL finite presentation of the first Conway group `Co₁`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.co1Presentation_transcribed` and the equations for the remaining fields: the
  characterization of the sealed row.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.co1Presentation_relatorLetters`: the forty-five compiled words checked against
  the decoder output in the independent source-to-Lean read-through.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.co1Presentation_map_length_relators`,
  `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.co1Presentation_totalLength` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.co1Presentation_relatorsCyclicallyReduced`: the three checks on the compiled
  words.

Each alternative is dispatched by the shape of its relator, not by goal position: a relator that
is a power is checked on its base through `EpsilonEridani.Relator.isCyclicallyReduced_toWord_pow`, and
every other relator is checked by direct computation, so inserting, removing, or reordering
relators cannot redirect a branch. The power route is also what makes the last relator tractable
at all: it is a thirty-ninth power whose expansion has three hundred and fifty-one of the
presentation's letters, and expanding it exhausts the elaborator. -/
