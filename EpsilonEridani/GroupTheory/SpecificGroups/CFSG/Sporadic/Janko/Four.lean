# A transcribed presentation of the fourth Janko group

This file carries the `J₄` row of the sporadic presentation data required by milestone S1 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`. It records John Bray's ATLAS version 3 presentation on
the type II standard generators `x`, `y`, and `t` as a `EpsilonEridani.GroupPresentation`, together with
its exact source, generator convention, transcription notes, expected counts, and count check.

The twelve relators are

```text
x², y³, (xy)²³, [x,y]¹², [x,yxy]⁵,
(xyxyxy⁻¹)³(xyxy⁻¹xy⁻¹)³,
(xy(xyxy⁻¹)³)⁴,
t², [t,x], [t,yxy(xy⁻¹)²(xy)³],
(y t^(yxy⁻¹xyxy⁻¹x))³,
((yxyxyxy)³ t t^((xy)³y(xy)⁶y))².
```

Here `r^s` means `s⁻¹rs`, as in the ATLAS Magma source. The source's commutator convention is
`[r,s] = r⁻¹s⁻¹rs`, opposite to Mathlib's `commutatorElement`, so a source commutator is stored as
`Relator.comm (.inv r) (.inv s)`. The structured expressions otherwise preserve the source's
products, powers, and conjugates. The proved `EpsilonEridani.Relator.toWord_toFreeGroup` is the audit
boundary between these expressions and the signed words consumed by `PresentedGroup`.

Bolt, Bray, and Curtis prove a symmetric presentation of `J₄` and convert it into an ordinary
three-generator presentation. The ATLAS publishes the resulting relator list as `J4G2-P1`; its
Magma file also records the double-coset-enumeration route through the involution centralizer
`2^(1+12)·3·M₂₂·2`, of index `3980549947`.

As an independent transcription check, GAP 4.15.1 with AtlasRep 2.1.9 evaluates all twelve
compiled words below to the identity after applying the ATLAS restandardization program from the
112-dimensional characteristic-two representation's type I generators to type II generators.
This computation is provenance rather than a Lean theorem: the file asserts no order, finiteness,
simplicity, or identification result. The independent `FiniteSimpleGroups` development named by
the roadmap does not cover `J₄`, so no cross-check against that development is available.

## Independent source-to-Lean read-through

An independent read-through used the bytes of the ATLAS Magma source `J4G2-P1.M` whose SHA-256
digest is `0ed9ed620f24b22490d2cb32f202ecbeb422ff665b4614b9ad8c6a6d7b118135`. Its constructor
`G<x,y,t>` fixes exactly the three-generator order published by `j4Presentation_generatorNames`.

The first seven constructor entries are, one for one, the seven active `M₂₄`-presentation words
on `x,y` displayed above. The remaining five entries extend them in this source order:

```text
t²,
[t,x],
[t, yxy (xy⁻¹)² (xy)³],
(y t^(yxy⁻¹xyxy⁻¹x))³,
((yxyxyxy)³ t t^((xy)³y(xy)⁶y))².
```

They agree with entries eight through twelve of `j4Presentation_transcribed`. In the last two,
expanding each source conjugate `t^s` as `s⁻¹ts` gives precisely `sourceConj t firstConjugator`
and `sourceConj t secondConjugator`; the two conjugating words agree letter for letter with the
Magma file. None of the twelve constructor entries is commented out or marked redundant. This
checks every source relator, inverse, exponent, conjugating word, and source-order position
independently of the original transcription and closes this row's S1 source-to-Lean read-through.

The row is a sealed definition, so it publishes an equation for each of its fields: the transcribed
relator expressions with their generator indices written out, and the provenance a manifest row
exists to record. Together with `EpsilonEridani.GroupPresentation.relators_def` and
`EpsilonEridani.GroupPresentation.mem_relatorSet_iff` the first of those determines the compiled words and
the relations defining the presented group, so a consumer reasons about the row without unfolding
it.

Three decidable checks accompany those equations. The relator lengths and their total record the
compiled data one word at a time and in aggregate, and cyclic reducedness is what makes such a
letter count comparable with a published presentation length, since both are measured after free
and cyclic reduction of each relator. This row records no published length, so the total here
states the transcription for a reviewer to compare with the source, rather than checking it against
a recorded number.

## Main definitions and results

* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.j4Presentation`: John Bray's ATLAS finite presentation of `J₄`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.j4Presentation_transcribed` and the equations for the remaining fields: the
  characterization of the sealed row.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.j4Presentation_map_length_relators`,
  `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.j4Presentation_totalLength` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Sporadic.j4Presentation_relatorsCyclicallyReduced`: the three checks on the compiled
  words.
