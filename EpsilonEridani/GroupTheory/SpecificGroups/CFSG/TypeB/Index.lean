# The validated indices of the untwisted family `Bₙ(q)`

The classification list carries the untwisted odd orthogonal family named `Bₙ(q)` for `n ≥ 2`,
whose matrix name in Gorenstein--Lyons--Solomon is `Ω_{2n+1}(q)`. This file cuts that family out of
`EpsilonEridani.ValidLieTypeIndex`, in the shape the other families are cut out in
`EpsilonEridani/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/Index.lean`: a constructor selector, the subtype of
validated indices it selects, an introduction form, and the diagram facts that hold of every index
of the subtype.

The selector is false on the Suzuki family `²B₂(2^(2m+1))`, which shares the rank-two diagram `B₂`
but takes an odd power of a half-Frobenius for its Steinberg map, and the two families on that
diagram are separated instead by `EpsilonEridani.RankTwoBLieIndex` and `EpsilonEridani.TypeB2LieIndex`.

This file is diagram-level indexing data only: it attaches no carrier, no endomorphism and no
group, and nothing here asserts that a named group is finite or simple. The rank-two members are
also served, beside the Suzuki family, in
`EpsilonEridani/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/TypeB/Two/Basic.lean`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex.IsTypeB` and `EpsilonEridani.TypeBLieIndex`: the constructor selector of the
  family and the subtype of validated indices it cuts out.
* `EpsilonEridani.TypeBLieIndex.ofB` and `EpsilonEridani.TypeBLieIndex.exists_eq_ofB`: the introduction form and
  the induction principle it supplies.
* `EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex.not_usesHalfFrobenius_of_isTypeB`: the family lies in the non-half-Frobenius
  subtype `EpsilonEridani.GraphTwistedIndex`.
* `EpsilonEridani.TypeBLieIndex.dynkinType_cartanMatrix_apply` and `EpsilonEridani.TypeBLieIndex.two_le_rank`:
  the Cartan matrix of the diagram such an index names, and the rank bound that the double edge
  naming the family imposes.

/-- Whether a Lie-type index belongs to the untwisted family `B_r(q)`.

This is a constructor selector, not a mathematical property of a group. It is false on the Suzuki
family `²B₂(2^(2m+1))`, which shares the `B₂` diagram but takes an odd power of a half-Frobenius
for its Steinberg map. The rank, field, and preferred-representative restrictions come from the
enclosing `EpsilonEridani.ValidLieTypeIndex`. -/

/-- The untwisted type-`B` family does not use a half-Frobenius: of the two families on the `B₂`

/-- A validated index in the untwisted type-`B` family `B_r(q)`.

In particular, its rank is at least two, and neither `B₂(2)`, whose recipe does not produce a
simple group, nor `B₂(3)`, which the list carries as `²A₃(2)`, is an index of this subtype. The
Suzuki family `²B₂(2^(2m+1))`, which shares the `B₂` diagram, is not of this subtype either. -/
