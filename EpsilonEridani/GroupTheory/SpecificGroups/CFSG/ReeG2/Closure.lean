# The algebraic closure for the Ree family of type `G₂`

This file records that the algebraic closure attached to a validated Ree index of type `G₂` has
characteristic three, and equips it with the resulting structure of an algebra over the field of
three elements. This is the base ring over which the family's short-root carrier is defined.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ReeG2LieIndex.charP_closure_three`: the algebraic closure attached to a Ree index of
  type `G₂` has characteristic three.
* `EpsilonEridani.ReeG2LieIndex.algebraZModThree`: the resulting `ZMod 3`-algebra structure on it.
