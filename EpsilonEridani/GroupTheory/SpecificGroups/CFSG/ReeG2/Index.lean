# The index of the Ree family of type `G₂`

`EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex` names the Ree family of type `G₂` by its constructor `reeG2 m`, whose
field order is `3 ^ (2m+1)`. This file selects that constructor and validates it, giving the
restricted index domain `EpsilonEridani.ReeG2LieIndex` on which the family's carrier, Steinberg
endomorphism and candidate group are built, together with the numerical facts a consumer of that
domain needs: its diagram is `G₂`, its rank is two, and its characteristic is three.

The selector is a constructor test, not a mathematical property of a group. Nothing here asserts
that a named group is finite or simple.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex.IsReeG2`: the constructor selector, with
  `EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex.isReeG2_iff_exists` naming the constructor and its parameter.
* `EpsilonEridani.ReeG2LieIndex`: a validated index in the family.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ReeG2LieIndex.exists_eq_of`: the eliminator matching the introduction form.
* `EpsilonEridani.ReeG2LieIndex.dynkinType_eq`, `EpsilonEridani.ReeG2LieIndex.rank_eq_two` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ReeG2LieIndex.characteristic_eq_three`: the diagram, rank and characteristic.
* `EpsilonEridani.ReeG2LieIndex.fieldOrder_eq_three_pow`: the field order is three to the recorded
  exponent.

/-- Whether a Lie-type index names the Ree family of type `G₂`, `²G₂(3^(2m+1))`.

This is a constructor selector, not a mathematical property of a group. The exclusion of `²G₂(3)`
comes from the enclosing `EpsilonEridani.ValidLieTypeIndex`; no finiteness or simplicity is asserted
here. -/

/-- A validated index in the Ree family of type `G₂`, `²G₂(3^(2m+1))`.

The outer subtype is important: `²G₂(3)`, the parameter `m = 0`, is excluded from the
classification list; its derived subgroup has index three and is isomorphic to a group already
named in another family, so the derived-subgroup recipe does not produce a new simple group there,
and `²G₂(3)` is not a `ReeG2LieIndex`. The Suzuki--Ree relatives `²B₂`, `²F₄` and the Tits group
are excluded too; they are the other three constructors of `EpsilonEridani.SuzukiReeIndex`. -/
