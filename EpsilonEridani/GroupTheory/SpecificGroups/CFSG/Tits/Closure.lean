# The algebraic closure for the Tits construction

This file records that the algebraic closure attached to the validated Tits index has
characteristic two, and equips it with the resulting structure of an algebra over the field of two
elements. These are the structures through which the index reaches the explicit type-`F₄` carrier
and its exceptional isogeny.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.TitsLieIndex.charP_closure_two`: the algebraic closure attached to the Tits index has
  characteristic two.
* `EpsilonEridani.TitsLieIndex.algebraZModTwo`: the resulting `ZMod 2`-algebra structure.
