# The Lie-type indices whose Dynkin diagram is unimodular

`EpsilonEridani.ValidLieTypeIndex.GeckGroup` gives every valid index a concrete matrix group with numbered
root subgroups and a Frobenius. That carrier is built from the adjoint representation, so the
characters occurring in it generate the root lattice and not, in general, the whole character
lattice of the pinned torus: it is expected to be the adjoint form of a Chevalley--Demazure group,
whereas the CFSG recipe has to be run in the simply connected form. The lattice condition that
separates the two forms -- that the weights span the whole character lattice -- holds by
`EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.span_range_geckWeight_eq_top_iff` exactly in the types `E₈`, `F₄` and `G₂`.

This file proves that span, and the closed immersion of the weight torus it buys, for
`EpsilonEridani.UnimodularLieIndex`, the valid indices whose underlying diagram is one of those three.
Six of the seventeen Lie-type constructors qualify, and they are of two kinds:

```text
E₈(q),  F₄(q),  G₂(q),        ²G₂(3^(2m+1)),  ²F₄(2^(2m+1)),  ²F₄(2)'.
```

The three on the left are untwisted, and their Steinberg map is the `q`-power Frobenius
`EpsilonEridani.ValidLieTypeIndex.geckFrobenius`; they are collected as
`EpsilonEridani.UnimodularExceptionalIndex` and carried through the rest of the recipe here. The three on
the right take an odd power of a half-Frobenius instead, so their Steinberg map is not built in
this file.

The predicate `EpsilonEridani.LieTypeIndex.HasUnimodularDiagram` is about the diagram alone, so it says
nothing about which Steinberg map an index takes. That is what makes it the right hypothesis here:
`²F₄(2^(2m+1))` and `²F₄(2)'` have the same character lattice as `F₄(q)`, and `²G₂(3^(2m+1))` the
same as `G₂(q)`, whatever endomorphism is later taken of their common carrier. The Suzuki family
`²B₂(2^(2m+1))` does *not* appear: its underlying diagram is `B₂`, whose Cartan matrix has
determinant two, so the Geck carrier is not its simply connected form.

Identifying the carrier itself with the pinned simply connected Chevalley--Demazure group, and
proving it reductive, is the Layer 9 work of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md` that this
roadmap consumes rather than performs; no declaration below asserts either, nor that a constructed
group is finite, perfect, or simple.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.UnimodularExceptionalIndex`: the unimodular indices whose Steinberg map is not a
  half-Frobenius power, that is `E₈(q)`, `F₄(q)` and `G₂(q)`, with
  `EpsilonEridani.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.AmbientGroup` their ambient group,
  `EpsilonEridani.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.simpleRootSubgroup` its numbered simple root subgroups,
  `EpsilonEridani.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.steinberg` their Steinberg map and
  `EpsilonEridani.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.Group` the candidate simple group, the derived subgroup of
  the fixed points of that map modulo the centre of that derived subgroup.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.UnimodularLieIndex.span_range_geckWeight_eq_top`: the Geck weights of an index with
  unimodular diagram span the whole character lattice, the lattice condition the simply connected
  form requires.
* `EpsilonEridani.UnimodularLieIndex.isClosedImmersion_geckWeightTorus`: consequently the pinned split
  torus is a closed subgroup scheme of the Geck carrier.
* `EpsilonEridani.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.steinberg_geckRootSubgroup` and
  `EpsilonEridani.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.steinberg_geckWeightTorus`: the Steinberg map raises the
  parameter of every numbered root subgroup, and every coordinate of a weight-torus point, to the
  `q`-th power, which is how the Steinberg map of an untwisted index acts on both halves of the
  pinned data of this carrier.
* `EpsilonEridani.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.mem_fixedSubgroup_steinberg_iff`: the fixed points of that
  map are the points of the carrier whose matrix entries lie in the field of definition `𝔽_q`
  recorded by `EpsilonEridani.ValidLieTypeIndex.fixedField`.

* `EpsilonEridani.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.primeFrobenius`, with
  `EpsilonEridani.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.coe_primeFrobenius_apply`,
  `EpsilonEridani.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.primeFrobenius_geckRootSubgroup`,
  `EpsilonEridani.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.primeFrobenius_geckWeightTorus` and
  `EpsilonEridani.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.steinberg_eq_primeFrobenius_pow`: the prime-field Frobenius,
  its entrywise action, its action on the numbered root subgroups and on the weight torus, and the
  Steinberg endomorphism as its `e`-th power.

## Carrier-level description

For the three untwisted branches treated here, `steinberg` is the `q`-power Frobenius on the Geck
carrier. Thus `mem_fixedSubgroup_steinberg_iff` identifies its fixed points with the carrier points
whose matrix entries lie in `𝔽_q`, and `Group` is the derived subgroup of those fixed points
modulo the centre of that derived subgroup. Both are formed on the Geck carrier, and they transfer
to the pinned simply connected group scheme of the diagram only along an identification of the two
carriers, which is not proved here. The other unimodular branches use half-Frobenius maps instead
and are therefore not included in `UnimodularExceptionalIndex`.

of the results here. It is a statement about characters only: that the carrier is reductive, and
that it is the pinned simply connected group of `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum`, are
