/-! # Recognition of the low-degree transitive groups by order

In degrees at most five, the order of a transitive permutation group determines its
transitive-group label up to one collision: the two labels of order four, `4T1` and `4T2`, are
distinguished by cyclicity. Together with `EpsilonEridani.TransitiveGroupLabel.isCyclic_iff`, which
transports cyclicity across a transitive-group label, this recognizes every label of degree at
most five from the order of the labelled subgroup alone, or from its order and cyclicity in
degree four.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.TransitiveGroupLabel.natCard_mem_three`,
  `EpsilonEridani.TransitiveGroupLabel.natCard_mem_four`: the order of a subgroup labelled `3Tj` or
  `4Tj` is one of `3, 6` or `4, 8, 12, 24`, respectively. In degree five the corresponding
  fact follows from `EpsilonEridani.natCard_mem_of_natCard_eq_five_of_isPretransitive` and
  `EpsilonEridani.TransitiveGroupLabel.isPretransitive`.
* `EpsilonEridani.transitiveGroupLabel_three_iff_natCard_eq`,
  `EpsilonEridani.transitiveGroupLabel_five_iff_natCard_eq`: in degrees three and five the order
  recognizes the label.
* `EpsilonEridani.transitiveGroupLabel_four_zero_iff`, `EpsilonEridani.transitiveGroupLabel_four_one_iff`: the
  two labels of order four in degree four are exactly distinguished by cyclicity.
* `EpsilonEridani.transitiveGroupLabel_four_iff_natCard_eq_of_two_le`: the order recognizes the labels
  `4T3`, `4T4` and `4T5`.
