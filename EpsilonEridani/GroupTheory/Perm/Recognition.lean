# Recognizing cycles and transpositions in a permutation group

This file supplies recognition steps that read off structure of a permutation group from cycle
data. A transitive subgroup of a finite symmetric group whose degree is prime contains a full
cycle. A permutation with exactly one 2-cycle and all its other cycles of odd length has an odd
power that is a transposition, and the exponent is given explicitly as the product of those odd
lengths.

Both feed the recognition of a full symmetric group, which needs a primitive group containing a
transposition: a transitive group of prime degree is primitive, and a transposition is what the
second result produces. In the Galois-theoretic application the cycle pattern of the element fed
to the second result is the degree pattern of a factorization of a polynomial modulo a prime, read
through the Frobenius element.

A subgroup of `Sₙ`, `n ≥ 5`, of index less than `n` contains `Aₙ`. This recognizes the large
subgroups in the low-degree classification, where the order of a subgroup bounds its index.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.card_dvd_natCard_and_natCard_dvd_factorial_of_isPretransitive`: the order of a
  transitive permutation group of degree `n` is a multiple of `n` and a divisor of `n !`.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_isCycle_mem_of_isPretransitive_of_prime_card`: a transitive permutation group
  of prime degree contains a full cycle.
* `EpsilonEridani.subgroup_eq_top_of_isPretransitive_of_prime_card_of_isSwap_mem`: a transitive
  permutation group of prime degree that contains a transposition is the full symmetric group.
* `EpsilonEridani.alternatingGroup_le_of_isPretransitive_of_orderOf_eq_three`: a transitive subgroup of
  `S₅` containing an element of order `3` contains `A₅`.
* `EpsilonEridani.subgroup_eq_top_of_isPretransitive_of_orderOf_eq_six`: a transitive subgroup of `S₅`
  containing an element of order `6` is the full symmetric group.
* `EpsilonEridani.alternatingGroup_le_of_index_lt`: a subgroup of `Sₙ`, `n ≥ 5`, of index less than
  `n` contains `Aₙ`.
* `Equiv.Perm.cycleType_eq_two_three_of_orderOf_eq_six`: an order-six permutation on five points
  has cycle type `(2, 3)`.
* `Equiv.Perm.isThreeCycle_of_orderOf_eq_three`: an order-three permutation on five points is a
  three-cycle.
* `Equiv.Perm.isSwap_pow_prod_erase_two_cycleType_and_odd`: if a permutation has exactly one
  2-cycle and all its other cycles have odd length, an explicit odd power is a transposition.
* `Equiv.Perm.exists_odd_isSwap_pow`: the corresponding existential form.
