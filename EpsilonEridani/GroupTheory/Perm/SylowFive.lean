# Sylow `5`-subgroups of `S₅` and the orders of its transitive subgroups

Let `α` be a type with five elements, so that `Equiv.Perm α` is the symmetric group `S₅` of
order `120`. Its Sylow `5`-subgroups have order `5`; there are six of them, and each has a
normalizer of order `20`.

The main result is a dichotomy for a subgroup `G` of `S₅` whose order is divisible by `5`:
either `G` lies between a Sylow `5`-subgroup `P` of `S₅` and its normalizer, or `G` contains
the alternating group. The two cases are distinguished by whether `G` has one or six Sylow
`5`-subgroups.

Applied to a transitive subgroup, whose order is divisible by `5`, this shows that the order of a
transitive subgroup of `S₅` is one of `5`, `10`, `20`, `60`, `120`. This is the first half of the
classification of the transitive subgroups of `S₅`: the transitive subgroups of order `60` and
`120` are `A₅` and `S₅`, and those of order dividing `20` sit inside the normalizer of a Sylow
`5`-subgroup.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.card_sylow_five_perm`: `S₅` has six Sylow `5`-subgroups.
* `EpsilonEridani.card_normalizer_sylow_five_perm`: each has a normalizer of order `20`.
* `EpsilonEridani.card_sylow_five_eq_one_or_six`: a subgroup of `S₅` has one or six Sylow
  `5`-subgroups.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_sylow_le_le_normalizer_of_card_sylow_five_eq_one`: if it has one, it lies
  between a Sylow `5`-subgroup of `S₅` and its normalizer.
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_alternatingGroup_or_eq_top_of_thirty_dvd_natCard`: a subgroup of `S₅` of order
  divisible by `30` is `A₅` or `S₅`.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_sylow_le_le_normalizer_or_alternatingGroup_le`: a subgroup of `S₅` of order
  divisible by `5` lies between a Sylow `5`-subgroup and its normalizer, or contains `A₅`.
* `EpsilonEridani.natCard_mem_of_five_dvd_natCard`: a subgroup of `S₅` of order divisible by `5` has
  order `5`, `10`, `20`, `60` or `120`.
* `EpsilonEridani.natCard_mem_of_natCard_eq_five_of_isPretransitive`: in particular so does a transitive
  subgroup of `S₅`.
