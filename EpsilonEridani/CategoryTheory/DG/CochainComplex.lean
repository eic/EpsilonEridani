# Cochain complexes as a differential graded category

Cochain complexes in an `R`-linear preadditive category are enriched in cochain complexes of
`R`-modules through `EpsilonEridani.linearHomComplex`, so they form a differential graded category.  This
file evaluates the differential graded operations of `EpsilonEridani/CategoryTheory/DG/Basic.lean` on that
example: the degree-`n` morphisms are the degree-`n` cochains, the differential is Mathlib's
signed `CochainComplex.HomComplex.δ`, the identity is the identity cochain, and composition is
composition of cochains with the Koszul sign.

That sign is the whole content of the comparison.  A differential graded category composes
`Hom(X, Y) ⊗ Hom(Y, Z) ⟶ Hom(X, Z)` while composition of cochains is a closed map out of
`Hom(Y, Z) ⊗ Hom(X, Y)`, and interchanging the two factors of a tensor product of complexes is
the Koszul braiding.  Hence a degree-`p` cochain `z₁` followed by a degree-`q` cochain `z₂`
composes to `(-1) ^ (p * q) • z₁.comp z₂`.  This is the bridge between Mathlib's enriched factor
order and Keller's untwisted operation `m₂ (g, f) = g ∘ f`, and it is what fixes the sign
conventions of every later differential graded construction.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.dgDifferential_linearHomComplex`, `EpsilonEridani.dgId_linearHomComplex` and
  `EpsilonEridani.dgComp_linearHomComplex`: the differential, identity and composition of this
  differential graded category.
