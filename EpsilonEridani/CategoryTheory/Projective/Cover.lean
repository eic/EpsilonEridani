# Essential epimorphisms and the uniqueness of a projective cover

A *projective cover* of an object `M` is an epimorphism `π : P ⟶ M` from a projective object which
is minimal, in the sense of being an **essential epimorphism**: a morphism `g` into `P` is an
epimorphism as soon as `g ≫ π` is one. That epimorphism condition is the definition used here —
`EpsilonEridani.IsEssentialEpi` — and nothing beyond `[Category C]` is assumed for it. It is what makes
"the" projective cover well defined: two projective covers of the same object are isomorphic
over it.

The familiar reading of minimality, that no proper subobject of `P` already maps onto `M`, is
intuition rather than a restatement, and the two are not interchangeable. In a *balanced*
category, where a morphism that is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism is an isomorphism,
essentiality *implies* subobject-minimality: a subobject `m : P' ⟶ P` with `m ≫ π` an epimorphism
is an epimorphism by essentiality, hence an isomorphism. The converse needs more than
balancedness — an epimorphism–monomorphism factorization, to reduce an arbitrary `g : X ⟶ P` to
its image before applying minimality to that subobject — which module and representation
categories do have, so there the two conditions agree. In an arbitrary category they need not,
and it is the epimorphism condition, not the subobject one, that the results below use.

Mathlib has projective objects (`CategoryTheory.Projective`) and projective *presentations*
(`CategoryTheory.ProjectivePresentation`, an epimorphism from a projective with no minimality
demanded), but neither essential epimorphisms nor projective covers. The module-level notion is
`EpsilonEridani.IsProjectiveCover` in `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.Module.ProjectiveCover.Basic`, phrased through the
superfluousness of the kernel; `EpsilonEridani.isProjectiveCover_iff_forall_surjective` shows that over an
additive group it is exactly the condition used here, so this file is the categorical reading of
the same notion, available in categories with no ambient kernel or subobject theory.

The uniqueness argument is short and needs no additivity, exactness, or subobjects — only the
lifting property of projectives and the fact that a split epimorphism whose section is an
epimorphism is an isomorphism (`CategoryTheory.IsIso.of_epi_section'`). Given two covers
`π : P ⟶ M` and `π' : P' ⟶ M`, lift `π` through `π'` to `h : P ⟶ P'`. Essentiality of `π'` makes
`h` an epimorphism, so projectivity of `P'` splits it: there is `σ : P' ⟶ P` with `σ ≫ h = 𝟙`.
That section satisfies `σ ≫ π = π'`, so essentiality of `π` makes `σ` an epimorphism too, and a
split epimorphism whose section is an epimorphism is an isomorphism.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsEssentialEpi`: `π` is an epimorphism, and every morphism into its source whose
  composite with `π` is an epimorphism is already one. An essential epimorphism from a projective
  object is a projective cover.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsEssentialEpi.isIso_of_comp_eq`: **rigidity** — any morphism between the sources of
  two projective covers of `M` that commutes with them is an isomorphism. Only the *target* of
  that morphism has to be projective.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsEssentialEpi.exists_iso`: **uniqueness** — two projective covers of `M` are
  isomorphic by an isomorphism commuting with the covering morphisms.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsEssentialEpi.exists_comp_eq_and_isSplitEpi`: **minimality** — every epimorphism onto
  `M` from a projective object factors through a projective cover by a *split* epimorphism, so the
  cover is a retract of every projective presentation of `M`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsEssentialEpi.isIso_of_isSplitEpi`: an essential epimorphism that splits is an
  isomorphism; hence `EpsilonEridani.IsEssentialEpi.isIso_of_projective_target`, a projective object is
  its own projective cover.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsEssentialEpi.comp` and `EpsilonEridani.isEssentialEpi_of_isIso`: essential epimorphisms are
  closed under composition and contain the isomorphisms.

## Implementation notes

Nothing here uses a preadditive structure — every declaration assumes only `[Category C]`, with
projectivity entering as a hypothesis on individual objects — so the file is placed under
`EpsilonEridani.CategoryTheory.Projective` rather than beside its import
`Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Preadditive.Projective.Basic`.

`IsEssentialEpi` carries `Epi π` as a field rather than as an instance argument, so that the
predicate is a single self-contained hypothesis that can be produced and consumed as a term. Its
second field takes the epimorphism hypothesis on the composite as an explicit argument for the
same reason.

/-- An **essential epimorphism** is an epimorphism `π : P ⟶ M` such that a morphism `g` into `P` is
an epimorphism as soon as `g ≫ π` is one. In a balanced category it implies that nothing smaller
than `P` already covers `M`; the converse implication needs in addition an epimorphism–monomorphism
factorization, as a module or representation category has. No subobject theory is assumed here.

An essential epimorphism from a projective object is a **projective cover**. Over a module
category this is exactly `EpsilonEridani.IsProjectiveCover`, by
