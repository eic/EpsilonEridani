# The graded resolution theorem for resolving subcategories

Let `E` be a graded exact category and let `P` be a resolving property for its underlying exact
structure. If `P` is stable under the grading shift, then its induced exact structure is graded,
and the inclusion of `P` into the ambient category induces an isomorphism

```text
K₀^gr(P) ≃ K₀^gr(C)
```

of modules over `ℤ[q,q⁻¹]`. Its inverse sends the class of an object to the alternating class of
any finite `P`-resolution. In particular, shifting an object and its resolution multiplies the
Euler class by `q`.

The additive equivalence is the general resolution theorem of
`EpsilonEridani.ExactStructure.IsResolving.resolutionEquiv`. Laurent-linearity follows because its
forward map is induced by the graded conflation-exact inclusion. Thus the common-refinement
argument establishing independence and additivity of the Euler class is inherited unchanged from
the ungraded theorem.

This differs from `EpsilonEridani.GradedExactStructure.laurentResolutionEquiv`, which assumes that `P`
consists of projectives and compares it with the full subcategory of objects of finite
`P`-dimension. Here `P` is resolving, so every ambient object has a finite `P`-resolution, and the
comparison is with the whole category.

A conflation-exact functor `F` into an ungraded exact category with `{1} ⋙ F ≅ F`, carrying `P`
into a resolving property of the target, forgets the grading on both sides of this isomorphism;
the resulting square commutes, so the specialization at `q = 1` of the graded resolution class of
an object is the resolution class of its image. The termwise form of that statement, for an
arbitrary finite resolution rather than the resolution theorem, is
`EpsilonEridani.GradedExactStructure.forgetGrading_foldAlternating`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.GradedExactStructure.IsResolving.laurentResolutionEquiv`: the graded resolution theorem
  for a shift-stable resolving property.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GradedExactStructure.IsResolving.laurentResolutionEquiv_toLinearMap`: the forward map is
  the map induced by the graded inclusion.
* `EpsilonEridani.GradedExactStructure.IsResolving.laurentResolutionEquiv_of` and
  `EpsilonEridani.GradedExactStructure.IsResolving.laurentResolutionEquiv_symm_of`: the values on object
  classes, with the inverse computed by any finite resolution.
* `EpsilonEridani.GradedExactStructure.IsResolving.foldAlternating_shift_eq_T_one_smul`: shifting a
  resolved object multiplies its resolution Euler class by `q`.
* `EpsilonEridani.GradedExactStructure.IsResolving.forgetGrading_laurentResolutionEquiv` and
  `EpsilonEridani.GradedExactStructure.IsResolving.forgetGrading_laurentResolutionEquiv_symm`: forgetting
  the grading along a conflation-exact functor into an ungraded exact category intertwines the
  graded and the ungraded resolution theorems, so that at `q = 1` the graded resolution class of an
  object is the ungraded resolution class of its image.
