# Abelian `K₀` of an essentially small abelian category

The abelian Grothendieck group `EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0 C` of an essentially small abelian category `C`
is the free abelian group on the isomorphism classes of objects modulo the relations
`[X₂] = [X₁] + [X₃]`, one for each short exact sequence `X₁ ⟶ X₂ ⟶ X₃`.

It is *not* a second presentation: it is defined as the exact `K₀` of the canonical exact
structure `EpsilonEridani.ExactStructure.abelian C`, whose conflations are exactly the short exact short
complexes. The whole exact-`K₀` API therefore applies verbatim, along the identification
`EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0.toExactK0`; what this file adds is the same API phrased in terms of
`CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.ShortExact` instead of conflations, functoriality under the exactness
hypothesis appropriate to abelian categories, and the calculus of kernels and cokernels which is
available here but not in a general exact category.

The last point is the substance of the file. Because an abelian category factors every morphism,
an arbitrary `f : X ⟶ Y` — with no monomorphism or epimorphism hypothesis whatsoever — satisfies
`[X] - [Y] = [ker f] - [coker f]` in `AbelianK0 C`; see
`EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0.of_sub_of_eq_of_kernel_sub_of_cokernel`. The proof splits `f` through its
coimage and its image and uses that the two agree.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0 C`: abelian `K₀`, with class map `EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0.of`, defined as the exact
  `K₀` of `EpsilonEridani.ExactStructure.abelian C`.
* `EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0.toExactK0`: the identification of abelian `K₀` with that exact `K₀`, along
  which the exact-`K₀` API transfers.
* `EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0.AdditiveInvariant C G`: an isomorphism-invariant function on objects which is
  additive on short exact sequences, and `EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0.lift` the homomorphism it induces.
* `EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0.map` and `EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0.mapEquiv`: functoriality for an additive functor
  preserving finite limits and finite colimits, and invariance under an additive equivalence.
* `EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0.fromSplit`: the canonical comparison out of split `K₀`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0.of_shortExact`: the defining relation, with
  `EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0.of_eq_add_of_cokernel` and `EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0.of_eq_of_kernel_add` its
  consequences for a monomorphism and for an epimorphism.
* `EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0.of_sub_of_eq_of_kernel_sub_of_cokernel`: for *every* morphism `f : X ⟶ Y`,
  `[X] - [Y] = [ker f] - [coker f]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0.liftEquiv`: the universal property. Invariants additive on short exact
  sequences correspond bijectively to homomorphisms `AbelianK0 C →+ G`.
* `EpsilonEridani.AbelianK0.map_comp_fromSplit`: naturality of the comparison out of split `K₀` in an
  exact functor.
