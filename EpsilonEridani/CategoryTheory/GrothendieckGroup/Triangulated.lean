# Triangulated `K₀` of a pretriangulated category

The triangulated Grothendieck group `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0 C` of an essentially small
pretriangulated category `C` is the free abelian group on the isomorphism classes of objects
modulo the relations `[Y] = [X] + [Z]`, one for each distinguished triangle
`X ⟶ Y ⟶ Z ⟶ X⟦1⟧`. It is the universal recipient of an invariant which is constant on
isomorphism classes and additive on distinguished triangles.

The construction is the presentation engine of
`EpsilonEridani/CategoryTheory/GrothendieckGroup/Presentation.lean` applied to the triangle relations,
so the skeleton and shrink choices are made once and for all there, and the whole public API
below is phrased in terms of objects and distinguished triangles of `C`.

Unlike exact `K₀`, triangulated `K₀` sees the shift: the distinguished triangle
`X ⟶ 0 ⟶ X⟦1⟧ ⟶ X⟦1⟧` forces `[X⟦1⟧] = -[X]`, hence `[X⟦n⟧] = (-1)ⁿ[X]` for every integer `n`.
The sign is recorded by `Int.negOnePow`, so that one statement covers negative shifts as well.
The biproduct triangles are distinguished, so the class map is additive on biproducts and
`EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.fromSplit` compares split `K₀` with triangulated `K₀`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.triangleRelation T`: the relation `[T.obj₂] - [T.obj₁] - [T.obj₃]` attached to a
  triangle, and `EpsilonEridani.triangulatedRelations C` the family of those attached to the
  distinguished triangles.
* `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0 C`: triangulated `K₀`, with class map `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.of`.
* `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.AdditiveInvariant C G`: an isomorphism-invariant, triangle-additive
  function on objects, and `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.lift` the homomorphism it induces.
* `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.map` and `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.mapEquiv`: functoriality for
  triangulated functors and invariance under triangulated equivalences.
* `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.fromSplit`: the canonical comparison from split `K₀`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.of_distTriang`: the defining relation, with
  `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.of_biprod` and `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.of_eq_zero_of_isZero` its
  biproduct and zero-object consequences.
* `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.of_fullSubcategory_distTriang`: in a full triangulated subcategory, a
  distinguished triangle of the ambient category with vertices in the subcategory gives the
  defining relation.
* `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.of_shift_one` and `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.of_shift`: the class of a
  shift, `[X⟦1⟧] = -[X]` and `[X⟦n⟧] = (-1)ⁿ[X]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.liftEquiv`: the universal property. Triangle-additive invariants with
  values in `G` correspond bijectively to homomorphisms `TriangulatedK0 C →+ G`.
* `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.fromSplit_surjective` and
  `EpsilonEridani.TriangulatedK0.map_comp_fromSplit`: triangulated `K₀` is a quotient of split `K₀`,
  naturally in a triangulated functor.
