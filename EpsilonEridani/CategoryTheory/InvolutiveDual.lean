# Involutive contravariant endofunctors

A contravariant endofunctor `F : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ C` is *involutive* when double dualization is naturally
isomorphic to the identity by an isomorphism satisfying the triangle identity
`CategoryTheory.Functor.IsInvolutiveDual`, which is strictly stronger than the bare existence of
such an isomorphism. The linear dual on finite-dimensional vector spaces and finite dualization
of finite locally free Hopf algebras are the motivating examples.

Turning such an `F` into an equivalence `Cᵒᵖ ≌ C` by `CategoryTheory.Functor.asEquivalence`
loses the involutivity: the inverse produced there is an abstract quasi-inverse, so no theorem
identifies it with `F` again. `CategoryTheory.Functor.dualityEquivalence` instead takes the
double-dual isomorphism as input and returns an equivalence whose inverse is `F.rightOp`, so
both directions and both structural isomorphisms compute.

## Main declarations

* `CategoryTheory.Functor.IsInvolutiveDual`: the triangle identity a double-dual isomorphism
  must satisfy.
* `CategoryTheory.Functor.dualityEquivalence`: the anti-equivalence attached to an involutive
  contravariant endofunctor, together with the computations of its functor, inverse, unit and
  counit in both directions.

/-- The triangle identity for a double-dual isomorphism `ev : 𝟭 C ≅ F.rightOp ⋙ F`: dualizing
`ev.inv` at `X` and then applying `ev.inv` at the dual of `X` is the identity. -/

/-- An involutive contravariant endofunctor is an anti-equivalence.

The inverse of the double-dual isomorphism `ev` plays the role of the counit, and the opposite
of that inverse plays the role of the unit, so unlike `CategoryTheory.Functor.asEquivalence` the
inverse of the resulting equivalence is `F.rightOp`: dualizing back is the same operation as
dualizing.

The body is exposed because the unit and counit computations below are not merely proved by
`rfl`: their statements only typecheck once `unitIso` and `counitIso` reduce. -/
