# Comparing objects in the skeleton of a full subcategory

Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.toSkeleton_eq_toSkeleton_iff` says that two objects have the same class
in `CategoryTheory.Skeleton C` exactly when they are isomorphic *in `C`*. When `C` is a full
subcategory `P.FullSubcategory`, that is an isomorphism of the bundled pairs, whereas a consumer
starts and ends with objects of the ambient category and wants an isomorphism there. The gap is
only bookkeeping -- the inclusion `ObjectProperty.ι` is full and faithful, so the two notions of
isomorphism correspond -- but it has to be crossed every time the skeleton of a full subcategory is
used as a type of isomorphism classes. This file crosses it once.

The same gap is crossed once more to descend functions to such a skeleton: a function on the full
subcategory that is invariant under isomorphism in the ambient category descends to the skeleton.

Its consumers are `EpsilonEridani.SimpleFDRepClasses` and `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.LineBundleClass`,
the types of isomorphism classes of simple representations and of line bundles.

## Main results

* `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.toSkeleton_eq_toSkeleton_iff_nonempty_iso`: two objects of a full
  subcategory have the same class in its skeleton exactly when they are isomorphic in the ambient
  category;
* `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.skeletonLift` descends a function on a full subcategory that is
  invariant under isomorphism in the ambient category to its skeleton, with computation rule
  `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.skeletonLift_toSkeleton`.
