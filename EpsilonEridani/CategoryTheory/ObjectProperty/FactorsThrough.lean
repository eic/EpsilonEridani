# Morphisms factoring through a class of objects

Given an object property `P` in a category, this file defines `P.FactorsThrough f`: the
morphism `f` admits a `CategoryTheory.Factorisation` whose midpoint satisfies `P`. It
records the closure properties of this predicate — enlarging `P`, composing on either side, and,
in a preadditive category, negating a factorization and adding two of them when `P` is closed
under binary products, the sum then factoring through the biproduct of the two intermediate
objects.

Everything here lives in Mathlib's root `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty` namespace, so that
`P.FactorsThrough f` elaborates as dot notation on an object property; a copy of that namespace
nested in `EpsilonEridani` would break it.

## Main definitions

* `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.FactorsThrough P f`: the morphism `f` factors through an
  object satisfying `P`.

## Main results

* `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.factorsThrough_iff`: the characterization of the predicate by
  an explicit intermediate object and two factors.
* `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.factorsThrough_id_iff`: when `P` is stable under retracts, an
  identity factors through a `P`-object exactly when its source satisfies `P`.
* `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.FactorsThrough.add`: over a preadditive category with binary
  biproducts, a sum of factorizations through a product-closed `P` again factors through a
  single `P`-object.
