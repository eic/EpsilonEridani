# Transitive `G`-sets

A `G`-set, in the categorical sense of an object of `Action (Type u) G`, is *transitive* when it
is nonempty and `G` acts transitively on its underlying type. This file records that condition as
an `ObjectProperty`, shows it is closed under isomorphisms, and names the resulting full
subcategory.

The action referred to is the one `Action.instMulAction` puts on the underlying type `ToType A`,
so both conjuncts are read through that instance rather than through `A.ρ`.
Following Mathlib's convention, `MulAction.IsPretransitive` allows the empty set, so nonemptiness
is a genuine extra condition and is imposed separately.

The property is named `EpsilonEridani.isTransitiveAction` rather than being placed in a
`EpsilonEridani.Action` namespace: `Action` is a Mathlib type, and `scripts/lint-dot-notation.py`
rejects a Mathlib type's namespace nested inside `namespace EpsilonEridani`, because dot notation on
that type then fails to elaborate.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.isTransitiveAction`: the property of being a transitive `G`-set.
* `EpsilonEridani.isTransitiveAction_iff`: its two conjuncts.
* `EpsilonEridani.smul_eq_ρ_apply`: the scalar multiplication both conjuncts refer to is evaluation of
  the representation.
* `EpsilonEridani.TransitiveAction`: transitive `G`-sets as a full subcategory of all `G`-sets, with
  `EpsilonEridani.TransitiveAction.mk`, `EpsilonEridani.TransitiveAction.forget`,
  `EpsilonEridani.TransitiveAction.isTransitiveAction` and
  `EpsilonEridani.TransitiveAction.fullyFaithfulForget`.
