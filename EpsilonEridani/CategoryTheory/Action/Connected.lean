# Connected `G`-sets are the transitive ones

An object of a category is *connected* in the sense of
`CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.IsConnected` when it is not initial and admits no nontrivial
subobject. This file identifies that condition for `G`-sets: an object of `Action (Type u) G` is
connected exactly when it is nonempty and `G` acts transitively on it, which is
`EpsilonEridani.isTransitiveAction`.

Mathlib proves the same statement for *finite* `G`-sets in
`CategoryTheory.Action.isConnected_iff_transitive`, but that proof runs through the fibre functor
of the Galois category `Action FintypeCat G`, machinery unavailable here: `Action (Type u) G` has
objects with infinite underlying type and is not a Galois category. The argument is instead run
directly, over the two facts about the forgetful functor `Action (Type u) G ⥤ Type u` that replace
it: it preserves and reflects monomorphisms, and a `G`-set is initial exactly when its underlying
type is empty.

Both facts are Mathlib's, once the concrete-category forgetful functor of `Action (Type u) G` is
known to preserve and reflect the empty colimit; that is what the two instances below record, and
with them `CategoryTheory.Concrete.initial_iff_empty_of_preserves_of_reflects` applies verbatim to
`G`-sets.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.mono_action_iff_injective`: a map of `G`-sets is a monomorphism exactly when it is
  injective.
* `EpsilonEridani.isConnected_action_iff_isTransitiveAction`: **a `G`-set is connected exactly when it is
  transitive.**
