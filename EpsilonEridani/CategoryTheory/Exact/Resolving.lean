# Resolving subcategories of exact categories

Let `E` be an exact structure on an additive category `C`. An object property `P` is resolving
for `E` when it contains a zero object, is closed under binary direct sums and extensions, is
closed under kernels of deflations between `P`-objects, and every object of `C` admits a finite
`P`-resolution.

This file packages those hypotheses as `EpsilonEridani.ExactStructure.IsResolving`. The full subcategory
on a resolving property inherits the exact structure induced from `E`; its inclusion preserves
and reflects conflations. These are the exact-category data used by the general resolution
theorem. Repleteness is derived from zero and binary-product closure rather than stored as a
redundant field.

The property of all objects is resolving. More substantially, the relatively projective objects
are resolving whenever every object admits a finite projective resolution. For the latter
example, kernel closure follows because a conflation with projective quotient splits, making its
kernel a retract of the projective middle term.

Finally, the resolving hypotheses control `P`-dimension along conflations with a resolving term.
The proofs use only pullbacks of deflations and the Noether conflation of a composite deflation,
never a splitting, and are what make the Euler class of a finite resolution well defined in
`EpsilonEridani/CategoryTheory/GrothendieckGroup/Resolving.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.ExactStructure.IsResolving`: the resolving hypotheses for an object property.
* `EpsilonEridani.ExactStructure.resolvingSubcategory`: the induced exact structure on the full
  subcategory.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ExactStructure.IsResolving.prop_X₁`: closure under kernels of admissible deflations.
* `EpsilonEridani.ExactStructure.IsResolving.isConflationExact_ι` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ExactStructure.IsResolving.reflectsConflations_ι`: the inclusion preserves and
  reflects conflations.
* `EpsilonEridani.ExactStructure.isResolving_top`: the full category is resolving.
* `EpsilonEridani.ExactStructure.isResolving_isProjective`: finite projective resolutions make the
  relatively projective objects a resolving subcategory.
* `EpsilonEridani.ExactStructure.IsResolving.exists_finiteResolution_X₁_length_le_of_prop_X₂`:
  **dimension shifting**. If `K ↪ Q ↠ X` is a conflation with `Q` resolving and `X` has
  `P`-dimension at most `n + 1`, then `K` has `P`-dimension at most `n`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ExactStructure.IsResolving.exists_finiteResolution_X₂_length_le_of_prop_X₃` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ExactStructure.IsResolving.exists_finiteResolution_X₁_length_le_of_prop_X₃`: extensions
  of a resolving object, and kernels of deflations onto one, do not raise `P`-dimension.

/-- An object property is **resolving** for an exact structure when it is additive and extension
closed, is closed under kernels of deflations between its objects, and gives a finite resolution
of every ambient object.

The first two fields imply that `P` is closed under isomorphisms, so repleteness is exposed as a
derived theorem rather than duplicated in the structure. -/

`P`. It is by definition `EpsilonEridani.ExactStructure.fullSubcategory`, so the Grothendieck-group

projectives form a resolving subcategory.

Extension closure follows because an extension with projective quotient splits. For kernel
closure, a conflation with projective quotient identifies its middle term with the biproduct of
its kernel and quotient; hence the kernel is a retract of the projective middle term. -/
