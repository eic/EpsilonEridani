# Finite resolutions in a graded exact category

In a graded exact category the grading shift `{1}` and its inverse are conflation-exact, so they
carry finite resolutions to finite resolutions. When the resolving class `P` is stable under the
shift, the shift of a finite `P`-resolution of `X` is a finite `P`-resolution of `X{1}`, with the
same length and the internal degrees of all its terms raised by one.

Consequently the objects of finite `P`-dimension form a shift-stable class as well. This is the
hypothesis under which the full subcategory of such objects carries the induced graded exact
structure of `EpsilonEridani.GradedExactStructure.fullSubcategory`, so that the resolution theorem can
be stated between graded Grothendieck groups.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GradedExactStructure.admitsFiniteResolution_inverseImage_shift`: if `P` is stable
  under the grading shift, then so is the property of admitting a finite `P`-resolution.

/-- **Shift stability of finite `P`-dimension.** If an object satisfies `P` exactly when its
shift does, then an object admits a finite `P`-resolution exactly when its shift does: a
resolution is carried across by the shift in one direction, and by the inverse shift followed by
transport along the unit isomorphism in the other. -/
