# Recognizing indecomposable objects from their endomorphisms

Mathlib defines `CategoryTheory.Indecomposable X` as the conjunction "`X` is not a zero object,
and in every decomposition `X ≅ Y ⊞ Z` one of `Y`, `Z` is zero", and proves exactly one criterion
for it: a simple object is indecomposable (`CategoryTheory.indecomposable_of_simple`). That
criterion is too strong for the objects that carry the theory of a finite-dimensional algebra: an
indecomposable projective module is almost never simple. The criterion that does apply is the one
this file supplies — an object all of whose idempotent endomorphisms are trivial is
indecomposable — together with the two forms in which it is used in practice. An object whose
endomorphisms are recorded faithfully in a *local* ring, by a map preserving zero, the identity and
squares, is indecomposable; this is the criterion behind the Krull–Schmidt theorem, and the one
the quiver Jordan blocks need, their endomorphism algebra `k[X]/(Xⁿ⁺¹)` being local but not a
field. And over a field, an object whose endomorphism space is one-dimensional (a *brick*) is
indecomposable.

The converse holds as soon as idempotents split, that is, over an idempotent-complete category
(`CategoryTheory.IsIdempotentComplete`, which every abelian category is): splitting `e` and `𝟙 - e`
produces two retracts of `X` whose idempotents add up to the identity, and any such pair realizes
`X` as their biproduct. So over such a category an object is indecomposable exactly when it is
nonzero and carries no idempotent endomorphism other than `0` and the identity, which is the form
in which indecomposability is *used*: it turns a decomposition of a vertex space into a
decomposition of the whole object.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.indecomposable_of_idempotent_eq_zero_or_id`: a nonzero object whose only idempotent
  endomorphisms are `0` and the identity is indecomposable.
* `EpsilonEridani.indecomposable_of_injective_of_isLocalRing`: **an object whose endomorphisms are
  recorded faithfully in a local ring, by a map preserving zero, the identity and squares, is
  indecomposable.**
* `EpsilonEridani.indecomposable_of_finrank_end_eq_one`: in a `k`-linear category over a field,
  **a brick is indecomposable**.
* `EpsilonEridani.isoBiprodOfRetracts`: two retracts of `X` whose idempotents sum to the identity exhibit
  `X` as their biproduct.
* `EpsilonEridani.idempotent_eq_zero_or_id_of_indecomposable`: the converse of the first criterion, over
  an idempotent-complete category, packaged with it as
  `EpsilonEridani.indecomposable_iff_idempotent_eq_zero_or_id`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isIso_of_isIso_comp`: an invertible composite `f ≫ g` through an object with only
  trivial idempotent endomorphisms has `f` invertible.

## Implementation notes

The idempotent hypothesis is phrased with composition, `e ≫ e = e`, rather than through the ring
`CategoryTheory.End X`, whose multiplication is composition in the opposite order; for an
idempotent the two agree, but the hypothesis is easier to discharge as stated.

`indecomposable_of_injective_of_isLocalRing` records the endomorphisms in an unbundled map `φ`,
asked to be injective, to send `0` to `0` and `𝟙 X` to `1`, and to carry squares to squares,
`φ (e ≫ e) = φ e * φ e`. Those are exactly the equations the proof consumes: an idempotent has an
idempotent record, a local ring pins that record to `0` or `1`, the two normalization equations
say which endomorphisms those values are the records of, and injectivity carries the dichotomy
back to the idempotent. Multiplicativity is asked on squares alone because that is where the proof
meets `φ`, and because it is the hypothesis that costs a use site least: asking instead that `φ`
turn every `≫` into a product would raise a question this one does not, the multiplication of
`End X` being composition in the opposite order. On a square the two orders agree, so no use site
has to choose between them. Bundling `φ` as a ring homomorphism would settle the order the other
way and demand additivity besides, which no use site has reason to prove. The ring is not asked to
be commutative because the endomorphism ring of an indecomposable object, the intended source of
`φ`, is not.

Two neighbours state the same idea in narrower settings and do not reach the objects that need it
here. `EpsilonEridani.indecomposable_iff_isLocalRing_end` asks `CategoryTheory.End` itself to be local but
is confined to `ModuleCat A` and to modules of finite length;
`EpsilonEridani.isIndecomposableModule_of_isLocalRing_end` is the statement for bare modules. A quiver
representation is a functor `Paths Q ⥤ ModuleCat k`, not an object of `ModuleCat A`, and asking for
`IsLocalRing (X ⟶ X)` would make every use site exhibit its endomorphisms as a ring first —
recording them instead in a ring already known to be local is what makes the criterion cheap to
apply.

`indecomposable_of_idempotent_eq_zero_or_id` extracts, from an isomorphism `X ≅ Y ⊞ Z`, the
idempotent `biprod.fst ≫ biprod.inl` transported to `X`. It is `0` exactly when `Y` is zero and the
identity exactly when `Z` is zero, so the hypothesis splits the decomposition; the proof reads off
`𝟙 Y` and `𝟙 Z` from it using only the biproduct equations `biprod.inl_fst`, `biprod.inr_snd` and
`biprod.inr_fst`.

That every endomorphism of a brick is a scalar is Mathlib's `finrank_eq_one_iff_of_nonzero'`
applied to the identity, which spans the endomorphism space because it is nonzero.

The brick criterion is stated for a field. The argument itself only inverts one scalar, so it
would run over a division ring, but `CategoryTheory.Linear` takes a commutative base and
`Module.finrank` is the invariant used by the consumers, so no generality is lost in practice.

`isoBiprodOfRetracts` asks only for the two retractions and the identity `r₁ ≫ i₁ + r₂ ≫ i₂ = 𝟙 X`;
the orthogonality relations `i₁ ≫ r₂ = 0` and `i₂ ≫ r₁ = 0` that make the comparison map an
isomorphism are consequences, extracted by cancelling the split monomorphisms `i₁` and `i₂`. Stating
it this way keeps it usable from any source of complementary idempotents, not only from
`CategoryTheory.IsIdempotentComplete.idempotents_split`.

/-- **An object whose endomorphisms are recorded faithfully in a local ring is indecomposable.**
The record `φ` is asked to be injective and to preserve zero, the identity and squares. An
idempotent endomorphism then has an idempotent record, and a local ring carries no idempotent
other than `0` and `1` (`EpsilonEridani.IsLocalRing.eq_zero_or_eq_one_of_isIdempotentElem`), so the
record — and with it the endomorphism, the record being faithful — is `0` or the identity. This is
