# Additive structure of morphism-ideal quotients

Quotienting an additive category by a two-sided morphism ideal preserves zero objects and
finite biproducts. These instances allow the quotient to be used as an additive category, not
just as a category with additive hom groups. The quotient functor preserves these biproducts
by Mathlib's `Functor.preservesFiniteBiproductsOfAdditive`; its standard biproduct comparison
isomorphisms therefore apply without a separate choice of sums in the quotient.

The constructions reuse Mathlib's `Functor.hasZeroObject_of_additive`,
`Functor.hasFiniteProducts_of_additive_of_essSurj`, and biproduct preservation API.
