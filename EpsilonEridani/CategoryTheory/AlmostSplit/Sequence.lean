# Almost-split (Auslander-Reiten) sequences

An **almost-split sequence**, or **Auslander-Reiten sequence**, is a short exact sequence
`0 ⟶ A ⟶ B ⟶ C ⟶ 0` whose first map is left almost split and whose second map is right almost
split.  It is the basic object of Auslander-Reiten theory: `B ⟶ C` absorbs every map into `C` that
is not a split epimorphism, and `A ⟶ B` absorbs every map out of `A` that is not a split
monomorphism, so the sequence records all the "inessential" maps at both of its ends at once.

`EpsilonEridani/CategoryTheory/AlmostSplit/Basic.lean` builds the two lifting conditions on a single
morphism; this file assembles them on a `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex` and develops the consequences
of the assembly, which is where the two conditions start to interact with exactness.

The definition carries only three fields, and this is deliberate: the textbook definition also
demands that the sequence does not split, that both ends are indecomposable, and that the right-hand
end is not projective, and **every one of those is a theorem**, not a hypothesis.  Non-splitness and
indecomposability already follow from the lifting properties alone, so they are available from the
two lifting fields through `EpsilonEridani.isEmpty_splitting_of_isRightAlmostSplit` and
`EpsilonEridani.IsRightAlmostSplit.indecomposable`; non-projectivity of the right-hand end and
non-injectivity of the left-hand end need exactness too, and are
`CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.IsAlmostSplit.not_projective_X₃` and
`CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.IsAlmostSplit.not_injective_X₁` below.  Assuming redundant clauses
would only make the predicate harder to establish.

Exactness also removes the degenerate case the morphism-level notions leave open.  A right almost
split morphism may be zero — over a field, `0 ⟶ k` is right almost split — but the second map of an
almost-split sequence is an epimorphism onto a nonzero object and so is never zero
(`CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.IsAlmostSplit.ne_zero_g`), and dually for the first map.

## Main definitions

* `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.IsAlmostSplit`: a short complex is almost split when it is short
  exact, its first map is left almost split and its second map is right almost split.

## Main results

* `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.IsAlmostSplit.not_isZero_X₁`, `.not_isZero_X₂` and `.not_isZero_X₃`:
  **all three objects of an almost-split sequence are nonzero**, because neither of its maps is.
* `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.IsAlmostSplit.not_projective_X₃` and `.not_injective_X₁`: **its
  right-hand end is not projective and its left-hand end is not injective.**  A projective
  right-hand end would section the sequence, an injective left-hand end would retract it.
* `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.isAlmostSplit_op_iff`: **being almost split is self-dual**, the two
  lifting conditions being exchanged by passage to the opposite category, so every statement about
  the left-hand end dualizes to one about the right-hand end.
* `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.isAlmostSplit_iff_of_iso`: the notion is invariant under an
  isomorphism of short complexes, so it descends to isomorphism classes of sequences.
* `EpsilonEridani.isEmpty_splitting_of_isRightAlmostSplit` and
  `EpsilonEridani.isEmpty_splitting_of_isLeftAlmostSplit`: **a short complex one of whose maps is almost
  split on the corresponding side has no splitting**, so an almost-split sequence does not split.

## Implementation notes

The lifting quantifiers of `EpsilonEridani.IsLeftAlmostSplit` and `EpsilonEridani.IsRightAlmostSplit` range over
all objects of the ambient category, and the ambient category intended for Auslander-Reiten theory
is the finite-dimensional one; see the implementation notes of
`EpsilonEridani/CategoryTheory/AlmostSplit/Basic.lean`, where the failure of the unrestricted form is
recorded.  Nothing in this file constrains `C` beyond what each statement needs, so instantiating it
at the finite-dimensional subcategory of representations of a finite-dimensional algebra recovers
the intended notion.

The declarations about an almost-split sequence sit in the `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex` namespace,
so that `hS.op` and `S.IsAlmostSplit` read as dot notation on Mathlib's
`CategoryTheory.ShortComplex`; the two morphism-level lifting conditions they are assembled from
stay in `EpsilonEridani`, and so do the two non-splitting results, which are statements about a short
complex carrying one almost split map rather than about an almost-split sequence.

Those two results sit in their own preadditive section rather than in the ambient
`CategoryTheory.Limits.HasZeroMorphisms` one: `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.Splitting` is stated for
the zero morphisms coming from the additive structure, which is not syntactically the ambient
instance, so sharing one variable block would leave the two `ShortComplex C`s unequal.

/-- **The right-hand end of an almost-split sequence is not projective.**  This is where exactness
enters: it supplies the epimorphism `S.g` that

section the sequence. -/

exchanged by `EpsilonEridani.isLeftAlmostSplit_op_iff` and `EpsilonEridani.isRightAlmostSplit_op_iff`, and the
opposite of a short exact sequence is short exact. -/
