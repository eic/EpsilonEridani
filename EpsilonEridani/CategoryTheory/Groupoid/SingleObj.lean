# A connected groupoid is equivalent to its vertex group

Let `C` be a groupoid and `x₀ : C` a *weakly initial* object, that is, one which admits a morphism
to every object. This file proves that the one-object category `SingleObj (End x₀)` of the vertex
group at `x₀` is equivalent to `C`, through the functor sending the unique object to `x₀` and an
endomorphism to itself.

Both halves are immediate once the functor is written down. It is fully faithful in any category,
because its action on the single hom-set is the identity of `End x₀`, and it is essentially
surjective because in a groupoid a morphism `x₀ ⟶ x` is already an isomorphism. What the
equivalence buys is a dictionary: functors out of `C` become functors out of `SingleObj (End x₀)`,
that is, objects with an action of the vertex group, and the dictionary is natural in the target
category; `EpsilonEridani.Groupoid.natIsoOfEnd` in `EpsilonEridani.CategoryTheory.Groupoid.ConnectedFunctor` is
that dictionary applied to isomorphisms.

The weak initiality hypothesis is stated as the family of nonemptiness assertions
`∀ x, Nonempty (x₀ ⟶ x)` rather than through `CategoryTheory.IsConnected`: the intended source of
that data is a path-connected topological space, whose fundamental groupoid comes with paths out
of a chosen basepoint.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Groupoid.singleObjFunctor`: the functor `SingleObj (End x₀) ⥤ C` picking out `x₀`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Groupoid.fullyFaithfulSingleObjFunctor`: it is fully faithful, without hypotheses.
* `EpsilonEridani.Groupoid.essSurj_singleObjFunctor` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Groupoid.isEquivalence_singleObjFunctor`: it is essentially surjective, hence an
  equivalence, when `x₀` admits a morphism to every object.
* `EpsilonEridani.Groupoid.singleObjEquivalence`: **a connected groupoid is equivalent to the
  one-object category of its vertex group.**
