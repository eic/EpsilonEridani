# Factorizations through subobjects

This file records two elementary forms of the universal property of a subobject. Factoring is
unchanged by precomposition with an equality-induced isomorphism, and a factorization through a
subobject is unique because its representing arrow is a monomorphism.

## Main declarations

* `CategoryTheory.Subobject.factors_eqToHom_comp_iff`: precomposition by an equality-induced
  isomorphism does not change whether a morphism factors through a subobject.
* `CategoryTheory.Subobject.factors_iff_existsUnique`: factoring through a subobject is equivalent
  to the existence of a unique lift.
