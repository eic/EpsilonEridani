# The multiplicative coefficient modules of Galois cohomology

Galois cohomology takes its coefficients in discrete modules over `G_K = AbsoluteGaloisGroup K`,
the automorphism group of a separable closure `Kˢ`. This file fixes the two multiplicative
coefficient modules once and for all, written additively through `Additive` as Mathlib's
`Representation.ofMulDistribMulAction` does:

```text
UnitsCoeff K = Additive (Kˢ)ˣ,      KummerCoeff K n = Additive μₙ,
```

with `μₙ = rootsOfUnity n Kˢ`. Both are **discrete** `G_K`-modules: their point stabilizers are
open because every element of `Kˢ` is separable over `K`, hence lies in a finite subextension
(`EpsilonEridani.stabilizer_isOpen_units`). The action on `μₙ` is in general nontrivial, and the Kummer
isomorphism is false for the trivial action, so it is the module and not the abstract group that
is named here.

The two maps between them assemble the **Kummer sequence**

```text
1 ⟶ μₙ ⟶ (Kˢ)ˣ ⟶ (Kˢ)ˣ ⟶ 1
```

as a `EpsilonEridani.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact`, so that the long exact sequence of continuous
cohomology applies to it verbatim. Exactness in the middle holds over any field and for any `n`;
surjectivity on the right is where `IsUnit (n : K)` enters, through the separability of `Xⁿ - a`
and the separable closedness of `Kˢ`.

Finally `EpsilonEridani.baseUnitsEquivInvariants` identifies `H⁰(G_K, (Kˢ)ˣ)` with `Kˣ`. These are not
the same Lean type — the invariants are an additive subgroup of `Additive (Kˢ)ˣ` — so what is
supplied is the canonical isomorphism and not an equality. Using the **separable** closure is
essential: for imperfect `K` the fixed field of the automorphism group of an algebraic closure is
the purely inseparable closure of `K` and not `K` itself
(`EpsilonEridani.mem_perfectClosure_iff_fixed`), so the invariants of the units of an algebraic closure
are strictly larger than `Kˣ`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.UnitsCoeff`, `EpsilonEridani.KummerCoeff`: the two coefficient modules, with their discrete
  topologies.
* `EpsilonEridani.kummerCoeffIncl`, `EpsilonEridani.unitsCoeffPow`: the inclusion `μₙ ↪ (Kˢ)ˣ` and the `n`-th
  power map, the two maps of the Kummer sequence.
* `EpsilonEridani.kummerShortExact`: the Kummer sequence as a short exact sequence of discrete
  `G_K`-modules.
* `EpsilonEridani.baseUnitsEquivInvariants`: the isomorphism `Kˣ ≅ H⁰(G_K, (Kˢ)ˣ)`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.unitsCoeff_continuousSMul`, `EpsilonEridani.kummerCoeff_continuousSMul`: the coefficients are
  discrete modules, that is, the action is continuous.
* `EpsilonEridani.mem_H0_unitsCoeff_iff`: a unit of `Kˢ` fixed by `G_K` comes from `Kˣ`.

## References

* J. Neukirch, A. Schmidt, K. Wingberg, *Cohomology of Number Fields*, 2nd ed., (6.2.1) and the
  display following it, for the Kummer sequence and the invariants of `(Kˢ)ˣ`.

/-- The multiplicative coefficient module of Galois cohomology: the units of a separable closure
of `K`, written additively. This is the module Hilbert 90 and the cohomological Brauer group are
stated at, and `KummerCoeff K n` is its `n`-torsion submodule. -/

written additively. The `G_K`-action on `μₙ` is in general nontrivial and the Kummer isomorphism
depends on it, so the coefficients are fixed as this module rather than as an abstract cyclic
group. -/
