# Embeddings into a normal extension, and the action on them

For fields `L` and `M` over a base `F`, the group `M ≃ₐ[F] M` acts on the embeddings
`L →ₐ[F] M` by postcomposition (`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/GroupAction/AlgHom.lean`). This file records
the three facts that make that action a dictionary for the subfields of `L`.

*Transitivity.* When `M / F` is normal, any two embeddings lie in the same orbit, because an
isomorphism between two embedded images extends to `M`. This asserts nothing about existence:
if no embedding `L →ₐ[F] M` exists the statement holds vacuously.

*Faithfulness.* When the embedded images generate `M` — that is, when
`IntermediateField.normalClosure F L M = ⊤` — an automorphism fixing every embedding is the
identity, so the action has trivial kernel.

*Counting.* When `L / F` is finite and separable, `M / F` is normal, and at least one embedding
`L →ₐ[F] M` exists, there are exactly `[L : F]` of them. All three hypotheses are needed: without
separability the count drops, and without normality the minimal polynomials need not split in `M`.

## Main results

* `AlgHom.liftNormal_equivFieldRange_apply`: lifting the isomorphism between two embedded
  images carries one embedding to the other. This isolates the field-range bookkeeping.
* `AlgEquiv.isPretransitiveAlgHom`: over a normal `M / F`, any two embeddings lie in one orbit.
* `EpsilonEridani.FieldTheory.eq_one_of_forall_smul_eq`: if the embedded images generate `M`, an
  automorphism fixing every embedding is the identity.
* `EpsilonEridani.FieldTheory.faithfulSMul_of_normalClosure_eq_top`: equivalently, the action is
  faithful. Injectivity of the permutation representation is then Mathlib's
  `smul_left_injective'`.
* `AlgHom.card_of_normal`: for `L / F` finite separable and `M / F` normal admitting an embedding
  of `L`, there are exactly `[L : F]` embeddings.

/-- **Lifting the isomorphism between two embedded images carries one embedding to the other.**

This isolates the field-range and coercion bookkeeping: `φ x` is transported into `φ.fieldRange`,
the isomorphism `φ.fieldRange ≃ ψ.fieldRange` is applied there, and `liftNormal_commutes` brings
the result back to `M`. Keeping it separate lets `isPretransitiveAlgHom` state only the
mathematical step. -/
