# The trace and the norm of a quadratic irrationality

An element `x` of a degree-`2` extension `E/F` that does not lie in `F` satisfies a monic quadratic
`x² = t x - d` over `F`, and the pair `(1, x)` is then an `F`-basis of `E`. In that basis
multiplication by `x` **is** the companion matrix `EpsilonEridani.companionFinTwo t d` of `X² - t X + d`,
which is the reading of the companion matrix its own docstring advertises. Since the trace and the
norm of `x` are the trace and the determinant of that matrix, and both are basis independent,
`Tr_{E/F} x = t` and `N_{E/F} x = d`.

These are what pin the elliptic normal form of `GL₂` in
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/NormalForm.lean`, where the quadratic is the
characteristic polynomial of a matrix and `x` is the eigenvalue it acquires in `E`.

Read in the other direction, every `x : E` satisfies the quadratic built from its own trace and
norm, `x² = Tr_{E/F}(x) · x - N_{E/F}(x)`, with no hypothesis on `x`: what the `x ∉ F` hypothesis
buys the two theorems above is not the equation but the *uniqueness* of its coefficients. This is
what separates the elliptic conjugacy classes of `GL₂(F)` from the split ones, an eigenvalue in `E`
outside `F` being exactly what a split class does not have.

Over a *finite* base field such an `x` always exists as soon as the quadratic has no root in `F`:
the quadratic is then irreducible, so `AdjoinRoot` of it is a degree-`2` extension of `F`, and any
two extensions of a finite field of the same degree are isomorphic
(`FiniteField.algEquivExtension`), so every degree-`2` extension already contains a root.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.trace_eq_of_mul_self_eq` and `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.norm_eq_of_mul_self_eq`: the trace
  and the norm of an element `x` of a degree-`2` extension satisfying `x² = t x - d`, and lying
  outside the base field, are `t` and `d`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.mul_self_eq_trace_mul_sub_norm`: conversely, every element of a degree-`2`
  extension satisfies the quadratic built from its own trace and norm.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_mul_self_eq_of_finite`: over a finite field, a quadratic with no root in `F` has
  a root in every degree-`2` extension.

hypothesis on `x`. Together with `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.trace_eq_of_mul_self_eq` and
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.norm_eq_of_mul_self_eq` this makes `(Tr x, N x)` the *unique* pair of coefficients
of a monic quadratic over `F` satisfied by an `x` outside `F`. For an `x` inside `F` the equation
still holds, `Tr x` being `2 x` and `N x` being `x²`, but the pair is no longer unique there, the
minimal polynomial being linear. This is what separates the elliptic conjugacy classes of `GL₂(F)`
from the split ones in
