# Minimal polynomials over a relatively algebraically closed base field

Let `F / k` be a field extension in which `k` is relatively algebraically closed, that is,
`IsIntegrallyClosedIn k F` — equivalently `algebraicClosure k F = ⊥` — and let `E` be a further
commutative `F`-algebra.  An element `x` of `E` algebraic over `k` then has the same minimal
polynomial over `F` as over `k`: the coefficients of `minpoly F x` are integral over `k`, because
that polynomial divides the monic polynomial `(minpoly k x).map (algebraMap k F)`, and relative
algebraic closedness puts them back into `k`.

Consequently, for `E` a field, `F⟮x⟯ / F` and `k⟮x⟯ / k` have the same degree.  This is the
mechanism behind the degree behaviour of a constant field extension: adjoining constants to `F`
costs exactly what adjoining them to `k` costs. More strongly, every separable extension
of `k` inside `E` is linearly disjoint from `F`, and a linearly independent family of separable
constants over `k` stays linearly independent over `F`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.minpoly.map_algebraMap_of_isIntegrallyClosedIn`: `minpoly F x` is the image of
  `minpoly k x`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IntermediateField.finrank_adjoin_simple_eq_finrank_adjoin_simple_of_isIntegrallyClosedIn`
  : `[F⟮x⟯ : F] = [k⟮x⟯ : k]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.linearDisjoint_fieldRange_of_isIntegrallyClosedIn`: a separable extension of `k` inside
  a common overfield is linearly disjoint from `F`.
* `EpsilonEridani.linearIndependent_algebraMap_comp_of_isIntegrallyClosedIn`: a linearly independent
  family of separable elements stays linearly independent after extending scalars from `k` to `F`.

## References

* H. Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*, 2nd ed., GTM 254, Springer, 2009,
  Section III.6.  This is the field theory behind the persistence of linear independence under a
  constant field extension (Proposition 3.6.1(b)); it is stated here for an arbitrary extension
  `F / k` with `k` relatively algebraically closed, with no function field involved.

Without the hypothesis only the divisibility `minpoly F x ∣ (minpoly k x).map (algebraMap k F)`
