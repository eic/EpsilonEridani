# The geometric degree of an extension of function fields

Let `F' / k'` be a finite extension of an algebraic function field `F / k`, so that `k'` is the
constant field upstairs and `k` the constant field downstairs.  The two degrees `[F' : F]` and
`[k' : k]` are related through the **compositum** `F · k'`, formed inside `F'`: the tower
`F ⊆ F·k' ⊆ F'` splits `[F' : F]` as `[F·k' : F] · [F' : F·k']`, and the second factor is the
**geometric degree** `n(F'/F)`, the degree of the extension after the constants have been
absorbed.

When `F` and `k'` are linearly disjoint over `k` this reads `[F' : F] = n(F'/F) · [k' : k]`.  The
hypothesis is carried here in the degree form `[F·k' : F] = [k' : k]`; that equality is equivalent
to linear disjointness when `k' / k` is finite and `k` sits in both `F` and `k'` compatibly with
the two routes into `F'`, and without those provisos it can hold for want of content, both sides
being `0`.  In particular `[k' : k]` divides `[F' : F]`, which is what turns the cross-multiplied
degree identity `[k' : k] · deg (Con D) = [F' : F] · deg D` for the conorm into
`deg (Con D) = n(F'/F) · deg D`.

Linear disjointness is not automatic; it is what an inseparable constant field extension can
destroy.  It does hold whenever `k' / k` is separable and `k` is the exact constant field of `F`;
that is `EpsilonEridani.linearDisjoint_fieldRange_of_isIntegrallyClosedIn`, from which the degree
equality is derived here.
Mathlib's predicate `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint` also supplies the degree equality, through
`EpsilonEridani.finrank_constantCompositum_eq_finrank_of_linearDisjoint`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.constantCompositum`: the compositum `F · k'` inside `F'`.
* `EpsilonEridani.geometricDegree`: the geometric degree `n(F'/F) = [F' : F·k']`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.finrank_constantCompositum_mul_geometricDegree`: the tower law
  `[F·k' : F] · n(F'/F) = [F' : F]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.finrank_eq_geometricDegree_mul_finrank_of_finrank_constantCompositum_eq`:
  `[F' : F] = n(F'/F) · [k' : k]` when adjoining the constants to `F` costs `[k' : k]`, and
  `EpsilonEridani.finrank_dvd_finrank_of_finrank_constantCompositum_eq` for the divisibility it contains.
* `EpsilonEridani.geometricDegree_eq_finrank_of_constantCompositum_eq_bot`: the geometric degree is
  the whole degree as soon as the compositum is trivial, however that is established.
* `EpsilonEridani.geometricDegree_eq_finrank`: the geometric degree is the whole degree when the
  constants of `F'` already lie in `F`.
* `EpsilonEridani.finrank_constantCompositum_eq_finrank_of_isSeparable`: that degree equality holds for a
  separable constant field extension over an exact constant field.
* `EpsilonEridani.linearDisjoint_fieldRange_of_isIntegrallyClosedIn` and
  `EpsilonEridani.linearIndependent_algebraMap_comp_of_isIntegrallyClosedIn`: the stronger
  linear-disjointness and persistence-of-linear-independence statements from which that degree
  equality follows.
* `EpsilonEridani.finrank_constantCompositum_eq_finrank_of_linearDisjoint`: it also follows from
  `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint`.

## Implementation notes

The two lemmas that *use* the hypothesis `[F·k' : F] = [k' : k]`,
`EpsilonEridani.finrank_eq_geometricDegree_mul_finrank_of_finrank_constantCompositum_eq` and
`EpsilonEridani.finrank_dvd_finrank_of_finrank_constantCompositum_eq`, are arithmetic in the tower
`F ⊆ F·k' ⊆ F'` and assume no relation between `k` and `F`, because Lean's `unusedSectionVars`
linter — which this repository enforces and does not disable — rejects a statement carrying
instances that appear neither in it nor in its proof.  The remaining three declarations of that
section — `EpsilonEridani.constantCompositum_eq_adjoin_simple`,
`EpsilonEridani.finrank_constantCompositum_eq_finrank_of_linearDisjoint` and
`EpsilonEridani.finrank_constantCompositum_eq_finrank_of_isSeparable`, where linear disjointness is
*established* — are stated over the compatible tower `k → F → F'`, `k → k' → F'`, as is the
consumer `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.degree_conorm`.

section LinearDisjoint

variable [Algebra k k'] [Algebra k' F'] [Algebra F F'] (F k' F')

/-- **The degree of a function field extension in terms of its geometric degree**: if adjoining
the constants of `F'` to `F` costs exactly `[k' : k]`, then `[F' : F] = n(F'/F) · [k' : k]`.

The hypothesis `h` is the degree form of the linear-disjointness condition on `F` and `k'` over
`k`; it is that condition in the situation where `k` sits in both `F` and `k'` compatibly with the
two routes into `F'`, where `EpsilonEridani.finrank_constantCompositum_eq_finrank_of_linearDisjoint`
derives it from `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint`.  That is the situation of
`EpsilonEridani.finrank_constantCompositum_eq_finrank_of_isSeparable`, where `h` is proved, and of
`EpsilonEridani.Divisor.degree_conorm`, where it is consumed.  Establishing `h` is where that
compatibility does the work, and where the condition can fail — an inseparable `k' / k` can
destroy it.  Deducing the degree identity from `h` is arithmetic in the tower `F ⊆ F·k' ⊆ F'`
alone, so no scalar tower relating `k` to `F` is assumed here: assuming one would leave it unused
in the proof and in the statement.

This is the companion of Stichtenoth's Proposition 3.6.6, which splits `[F' : F]` the same way. -/

/-- **Adjoining a separable constant field extension to the lower function field preserves
finrank**, provided the constant field downstairs is exact: `[F·k' : F] = [k' : k]`, which for
finite `k' / k` is the degree form of linear disjointness of `F` and `k'` over `k`.

This is the degree consequence of Stichtenoth's Proposition 3.6.1(b); that proposition's own
statement — the persistence over `k'` of linear independence over `k` — is
`EpsilonEridani.linearIndependent_algebraMap_comp_of_isIntegrallyClosedIn`.

This is the statement in which that condition has content, and it is stated over the full
compatible tower: `k` embeds in `F` and in `k'`, and the two routes `k → F → F'` and `k → k' → F'`
agree.  Both hypotheses are used: exactness of `k` in `F` keeps the minimal polynomial of a
constant irreducible over `F` (`EpsilonEridani.minpoly.map_algebraMap_of_isIntegrallyClosedIn`), while
separability lets the linear-disjointness proof reduce each finite family in `k'` to a finite
separable subextension. -/
