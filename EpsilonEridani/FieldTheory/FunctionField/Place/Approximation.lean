# Weak approximation for the places of an algebraic function field

Finitely many distinct places of a function field `F/k` impose independent conditions on `F`:
given pairwise distinct places `P₁, …, Pₙ`, target functions `f₁, …, fₙ : F` and prescribed
integers `r₁, …, rₙ`, there is a single `g : F` with `ord_{Pᵢ} (g - fᵢ) = rᵢ` for every `i`.
This is the **weak approximation theorem**, Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*,
Theorem 1.3.1, in the equality form; it is `EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_forall_ord_sub_eq`.

The analytic content is not reproved here. `EpsilonEridani.Valuation.exists_forall_sub_eq_exp` already
proves weak approximation for an arbitrary finite family of surjective, pairwise inequivalent
`ℤᵐ⁰`-valued valuations of a field, by way of Mathlib's
`AbsoluteValue.denseRange_algebraMap_pi`. What a place adds is exactly the two hypotheses that
engine consumes: its valuation is surjective by normalization, and distinct places have
inequivalent valuations because a normalized valuation is determined by its equivalence class
(`EpsilonEridani.Place.eq_of_isEquiv`). So the work in this file is to package the conclusion in the
additive `ord` vocabulary and to draw the consequences the divisor theory uses.

Taking all targets to be `0` prescribes the orders themselves
(`EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_forall_ord_eq`), which is the form in which independence of places is
usually met: a function may be asked to have a simple zero at one place and a pole of any
prescribed order at each of finitely many others. Taking all prescribed orders to be `1`
instead makes `g` agree with each target to first order. When the targets are integral, so is
`g`; choosing integral lifts of prescribed residue classes therefore shows that the residue
maps of finitely many distinct places are simultaneously surjective
(`EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_forall_residue_eq`), a Chinese-remainder statement for the places of `F`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_forall_ord_sub_eq`: **weak approximation** (Stichtenoth, Theorem 1.3.1).
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_forall_mem_valuation_sub_le`: weak approximation along a finite set of
  places, as the bound `v_P (g - f P) ≤ exp (r P)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_forall_ord_eq` and `EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_ne_zero_forall_ord_eq`:
  prescribed orders at finitely many distinct places, by an arbitrary and by a nonzero function.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_ord_eq_one_and_forall_mem_ord_eq_zero`: a function with a simple zero at
  a given place which is a unit at each of finitely many other places.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_mem_integers_notMem_integers`: the valuation rings of two distinct
  places are incomparable.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_forall_residue_eq`: simultaneous surjectivity of the residue maps of
  finitely many distinct places.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_residue_eq_and_forall_mem_ord_eq`: a prescribed residue at one place
  together with prescribed orders at finitely many others.

## Implementation notes

The families are indexed by a `Finite` type together with an injective map to `Place k F`,
matching the shape of the approximation engine. The `Finset` restatements
(`EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_forall_mem_ord_sub_eq` and
`EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_forall_mem_ord_eq`) are what the divisor theory, which meets places as
elements of the support of a divisor rather than as a numbered list, actually applies.

/-- **The weak approximation theorem** for the places of an algebraic function field
(Stichtenoth, Theorem 1.3.1), in the equality form: for finitely many pairwise distinct places
`P i`, arbitrary target functions `f i` and arbitrary prescribed integers `r i`, some single
`g : F` satisfies `ord_{P i} (g - f i) = r i` for every `i`.

The prescription is an equality, not an inequality: the error `g - f i` is not merely small at
`P i`, its order there is exactly `r i`. In particular `g - f i ≠ 0` whenever `r i ≠ 0`. -/

is `0`, and then a constant serves. -/

prescribed positive order — at each of the remaining places. This is the shape Stichtenoth's
count of the zeros of a function consumes: a lift of a residue basis at one place must not
interfere with the other places under consideration. -/
