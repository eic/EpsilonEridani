# Existence of extensions of places

Every place of an algebraic function field extends across an integral field extension. More
generally, the base field may also grow by an integral extension: a valuation trivial on the
smaller base field is automatically trivial on the larger one. For an extension of algebraic
function fields with `F' / F` finite, both integrality hypotheses are automatic, the one on the
base fields because the base extension is then finite. The same argument shows that the places
above a place `P` see the whole integral closure of its valuation ring: an element regular at
all of them is integral over `𝒪_P`.

The proof dominates the local valuation ring of the original place by a valuation subring of the
larger function field. Locality ensures that the resulting valuation subring is proper. Since
valuation subrings are integrally closed, it contains the enlarged base field, so it defines a
place whose restriction is the original place.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Place.restrict_surjective`: every place downstairs is the restriction of a place
  upstairs (Stichtenoth, Proposition 3.1.7).
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.restrict_surjective_of_finiteDimensional`: the same statement for an extension
  of algebraic function fields, where both integrality hypotheses are theorems rather than
  hypotheses.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.isIntegral_iff_forall_restrict_eq_mem_integers`: the integral closure of the
  valuation ring `𝒪_P` in the larger field is the intersection of the valuation rings of the
  places above `P` (Stichtenoth, Section III.2).

/-- **The integral closure of `𝒪_P` is the intersection of the valuation rings above `P`**
(Stichtenoth, Section III.2): an element of `F'` is integral over the valuation ring of a place
`P` of `F / k` exactly when it is regular at every place of `F' / k'` lying over `P`.

An element outside the integral closure is separated from it by a valuation subring of `F'`; that
subring contains the base field `k'`, whose elements are integral over `k`, and it contains
`𝒪_P`, so it is the valuation ring of a place lying over `P`. -/

/-- **Existence of extensions of places for an extension of function fields** (Stichtenoth,
Proposition 3.1.7): every place of `F / k` is the restriction of a place of `F' / k'`.

This is a convenience corollary of `EpsilonEridani.Place.restrict_surjective`, which replaces both
explicit integrality hypotheses by the function-field hypotheses together with finiteness of
`F' / F`: it asks nothing of the base extension, since `k' / k` is then finite by
`EpsilonEridani.IsFunctionField.finiteDimensional_baseExtension`.  The general statement
`EpsilonEridani.Place.restrict_surjective` stays available for an infinite algebraic extension
`F' / F`. -/
