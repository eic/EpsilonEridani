# The degree of a place over the place below it

Let `F' / F` be an algebraic extension of fields, both with the same field of constants `k`, and
let `P'` be a place of `F' / k` lying over the place `P = P'|_F` of `F / k`. The residue fields
then form a tower `k ⊆ F_P ⊆ F'_{P'}`, so the multiplicativity of `Module.finrank` reads

`deg P' = deg P · f(P' ∣ P)`.

This is the same-constant-field case of Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*, 2nd
ed., Corollary 3.1.14, where the general form is cross-multiplied as
`[k' : k] · deg P' = deg P · f(P' ∣ P)`. The extra factor cannot be written here: the residue
field of a place of `F' / k'` is a `k'`-algebra, and the `k`-algebra structure needed to speak of
`Module.finrank k F'_{P'}` at all comes with the constant-field extension theory.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Place.degree_eq_degree_restrict_mul_relativeDegree`: `deg P' = deg P · f(P' ∣ P)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.degree_restrict_le`: hence `deg P ≤ deg P'`, the form consumed when a
  finiteness statement about places of `F` is transported to `F'`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.relativeDegree_eq_one_of_isSepClosed`: a separable extension of a separably closed
  residue field has relative degree `1`.
