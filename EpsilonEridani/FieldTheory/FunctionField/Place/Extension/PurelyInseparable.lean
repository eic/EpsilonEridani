# Places in a purely inseparable extension

Let `F' / k'` be an extension of the field extension `F / k` in which `F' / F` is purely
inseparable: every `z ∈ F'` has a power `z ^ q ^ n` in `F`, where `q` is the exponential
characteristic. Such an extension is invisible to places in the following sense.

* **A place of `F` has at most one place of `F'` above it.** Whether `z` is regular at a place
  `P'` of `F'` is decided by whether its power `z ^ q ^ n ∈ F` is regular at the place `P` below,
  so the valuation ring of `P'` — and hence `P'` itself — is determined by `P`. Together with the
  existence of extensions of places (`EpsilonEridani.Place.restrict_surjective`), there is exactly one.
* **The fundamental identity has a single term:** at a place of an algebraic function field `F / k`
  and for `F' / F` finite, `e(P' ∣ P) · f(P' ∣ P) = [F' : F]`.
* **The residue extension is purely inseparable**, since the residue of `z` has the residue of
  `z ^ q ^ n` as a `q ^ n`-th power.

In particular, for a purely inseparable step of prime degree `p` the product `e · f` is `p`, so
the place is either totally ramified (`e = p`, `f = 1`) or has residue degree `p` (`e = 1`,
`f = p`). The clean conclusion `e = [F' : F]`, `f = 1` holds as soon as the residue extension is
also separable — for instance when the residue field of `P` is perfect, which is automatic over a
perfect constant field — because an extension that is both separable and purely inseparable is
trivial.

Without that hypothesis the conclusion fails, and the last section proves the standard
counterexample. Let `k` have characteristic `p` and let `s ∈ k` not be a `p`-th power. In
`F' = k(x)` over `F = k(t)` with `t = x ^ p`, the place `P'` of `x ^ p − s` lies over the zero `P`
of `t − s`, and `e(P' ∣ P) = 1`, `f(P' ∣ P) = p`: the residue field of `P` is `k`, while that of
`P'` is `k(s^{1/p})`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Place.restrict_injective_of_isPurelyInseparable`: in a purely inseparable extension,
  distinct places lie over distinct places; with the existence of extensions this is
  `EpsilonEridani.Place.restrict_bijective_of_isPurelyInseparable`, a unique place above each place.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.ramificationIdx_mul_relativeDegree_eq_finrank_of_isPurelyInseparable`:
  `e(P' ∣ P) · f(P' ∣ P) = [F' : F]` for every place `P'` of a finite purely inseparable extension
  of an algebraic function field.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.isPurelyInseparable_residueField`: the residue extension at a place of a purely
  inseparable extension is purely inseparable.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.relativeDegree_eq_one_of_isPurelyInseparable` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Place.ramificationIdx_eq_finrank_of_isPurelyInseparable`: `f(P' ∣ P) = 1` and
  `e(P' ∣ P) = [F' : F]` when the residue extension is separable.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.ramificationIdx_adicOfIrreducible_X_pow_sub_C`,
  `EpsilonEridani.Place.ord_restrict_adicOfIrreducible_X_pow_sub_C` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Place.relativeDegree_adicOfIrreducible_X_pow_sub_C`: the counterexample
  `e = 1`, `f = p` in `k(x) / k(x ^ p)` at the zero of `x ^ p − s`.

/-! ### An unramified place of a purely inseparable extension

Let `k` have characteristic `p` and let `s ∈ k` not be a `p`-th power, so that `x ^ p − s` is
irreducible. In `k(x)` over `k(t)`, `t = x ^ p`, the place of `x ^ p − s` lies over the zero of
`t − s` with ramification index `1` and relative degree `p`, although the extension is purely
inseparable of degree `p`. The residue field `k` of the place below is not perfect. -/
