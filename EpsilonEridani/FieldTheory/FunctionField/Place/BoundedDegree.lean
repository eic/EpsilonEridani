# Over a finite constant field there are finitely many places of bounded degree

Let `F / k` be an algebraic function field whose constant field `k` is **finite**. Then for every
bound `r` only finitely many places of `F / k` have degree at most `r`.

On the rational function field this is a count of polynomials: by the classification of the
places of `k(x)` they are the place at infinity together with the monic irreducible polynomials,
and the degree of the place of `q` is `deg q`, so a bound on the degree of a place is a bound on
the degree of a polynomial over a finite field. In general one chooses a transcendental `x`,
which makes `F` a finite extension of `k(x)`; a place of `F` is at least as large as the place of
`k(x)` below it (`EpsilonEridani.Place.degree_restrict_le`), and each place of `k(x)` has only finitely
many extensions (`EpsilonEridani.Place.finite_setOf_restrict_eq`), so the bounded-degree places of `F`
sit in finitely many finite fibres.

This is the counting input of Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*, 2nd ed.,
Lemma 5.1.1, on the way to the finiteness of the degree-zero divisor class group; it is not the
lemma itself, which counts effective divisors.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Place.finite_setOf_degree_le_ratFunc`: the bounded-degree places of `k(x)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.finite_setOf_degree_le`: the bounded-degree places of an arbitrary algebraic
  function field over a finite constant field.
