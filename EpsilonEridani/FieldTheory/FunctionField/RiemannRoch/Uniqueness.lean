# Uniqueness of the Riemann–Roch data

The Riemann–Roch theorem asserts that there are a natural number `g₀` and a divisor `W` of an
algebraic function field `F / k` with

`ℓ(D) = deg D + 1 - g₀ + ℓ(W - D)` for every divisor `D`.

This file proves that such a pair is essentially unique, **before** any such pair is constructed:
`g₀` is forced to be the genus `g(F/k)` of Riemann's theorem, `W` is forced to have
`ℓ(W) = g` and `deg W = 2g - 2`, and any two such `W` are linearly equivalent, so they span a
single divisor class.  Once a Weil differential produces one such `W` — the canonical divisor —
these statements say that the genus and the canonical class of the Riemann–Roch theorem are the
genus and the canonical class, and not merely some pair that happens to satisfy the identity.
This is Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*, 2nd ed. (GTM 254),
Proposition 1.6.1.

The proofs use only Riemann's theorem and the degree-zero calculus already available: `g₀ = g`
comes from evaluating the identity at divisors of large degree, where Riemann's theorem is an
equality and `ℓ(W - D)` vanishes because `W - D` is a negative divisor; `ℓ(W) = g₀` and
`deg W = 2g₀ - 2` come from evaluating it at `D = 0` and at `D = W`; and the linear equivalence
of two Riemann–Roch divisors comes from `ℓ(W' - W) = 1` together with `deg (W' - W) = 0`, which
is exactly the criterion for a degree-zero divisor to be principal.

The predicate is not vacuous: the rational function field satisfies the Riemann–Roch identity
with `g₀ = 0` and `W = -2 · P_∞`, proved here from the closed formula
`ℓ(D) = (deg D + 1)⁺` for divisors of `k(x)`.  Applying `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.IsRiemannRochDivisor`'s
consequences to that witness recovers `g(k(x)) = 0`, `ℓ(-2 · P_∞) = 0` and
`deg (-2 · P_∞) = -2 = 2g - 2`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.IsRiemannRochDivisor`: `W` satisfies the Riemann–Roch identity with the
  natural number `g₀` in the role of the genus.  The name is provisional in the sense that the
  results below show the only such divisors are the canonical ones, with `g₀ = g`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.IsRiemannRochDivisor.genus_eq`: `g₀` is the genus (Stichtenoth,
  Proposition 1.6.1).
* `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.IsRiemannRochDivisor.dim_eq` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.IsRiemannRochDivisor.degree_eq`: `ℓ(W) = g₀` and `deg W = 2g₀ - 2`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.IsRiemannRochDivisor.indexOfSpecialty_eq`: the identity read as duality,
  `i(D) = ℓ(W - D)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.IsRiemannRochDivisor.linearlyEquivalent`: **any two Riemann–Roch divisors are
  linearly equivalent**, so the class they determine — the canonical class — is well defined
  ahead of its construction; `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.IsRiemannRochDivisor.of_linearlyEquivalent` is the
  converse transport, so the property depends only on the divisor class.
* `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.isRiemannRochDivisor_neg_two_zsmul_ofPoint_infty`: `-2 · P_∞` is a
  Riemann–Roch divisor of the rational function field, with `g₀ = 0`.

## Provenance

The mathematics is Stichtenoth's and the Lean development is independent. The separate
`vaca22/riemann-roch-function-fields` project (Guanghao Li, Apache-2.0) carries a complete
function-field Riemann–Roch development by the same Stichtenoth route; no code is copied or
adapted from it here.

/-- **A Riemann–Roch divisor for the value `g₀`**: a divisor `W` for which the Riemann–Roch

`g₀` in the role of the genus (Stichtenoth, Theorem 1.5.15 in the form of Proposition 1.6.1).

The results in this file show that `g₀` is then the genus of `F / k` and that any two such `W`
are linearly equivalent; the Riemann–Roch theorem itself is the assertion that one exists, and
exhibits the divisor of a nonzero Weil differential as such a `W`. -/

Proposition 1.6.1).

Riemann's theorem is an equality `ℓ(D) = deg D + 1 - g` in large degree.  The divisors
`D = W + n · P`, for a place `P` and `n ≥ 1`, have arbitrarily large degree and satisfy
`W - D = -n · P < 0`, so `ℓ(W - D) = 0` and the Riemann–Roch identity reads
`ℓ(D) = deg D + 1 - g₀` there; comparing the two forces `g₀ = g`. -/

/-- **`-2 · P_∞` is a Riemann–Roch divisor of `k(x)`, with `g₀ = 0`**: the closed formula
`ℓ(D) = (deg D + 1)⁺` on the rational function field turns the Riemann–Roch identity into an
identity between truncated integers.

This is the witness that keeps `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.IsRiemannRochDivisor` from being vacuous, and
the acceptance instance for the general statements above: it has `deg (-2 · P_∞) = -2`,
`ℓ(-2 · P_∞) = 0` and, by `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.IsRiemannRochDivisor.genus_eq`, `g(k(x)) = 0`. -/
