# Holomorphy rings in an extension: `𝒪'_P` is the integral closure of `𝒪_P`

Let `F' / k'` be an extension of the algebraic function field `F / k`, integral both on the
constants and on the functions. Every place `P'` of `F' / k'` restricts to a place
`P'.restrict k F` of `F / k` (`EpsilonEridani.Place.restrict`), and at a single place `P` the integral
closure `𝒪'_P` of `𝒪_P` in `F'` is already known to be the intersection of the valuation rings
of the fibre over `P` (`EpsilonEridani.Place.isIntegral_iff_forall_restrict_eq_mem_integers`). This file
extends that computation from one place to a set of them: for a set `S` of places of `F / k`, the
intersection of the valuation rings `𝒪_{P'}` over the places `P'` lying over `S` is the integral
closure of the holomorphy ring `𝒪_S = ⋂_{P ∈ S} 𝒪_P` in `F'`. So integrality over an arbitrary
holomorphy ring is regularity above its defining set of places.

It also reads the fibre back off the integral closure: the places of `F' / k'` at which every
function of `𝒪'_P` is regular are exactly the places over `P`, and likewise over a set.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.coe_holomorphyRing_setOf_restrict_mem` and
  `EpsilonEridani.mem_holomorphyRing_setOf_restrict_mem_iff_isIntegral`: the holomorphy ring of the
  places lying over `S` is the integral closure of `𝒪_S` in `F'`, in set and membership form.
* `EpsilonEridani.coe_integralClosure_integers_subset_integers_iff`: the places of `F' / k'` at which
  every function of `𝒪'_P` is regular are exactly the places over `P`, so `𝒪'_P` remembers the
  fibre; `EpsilonEridani.coe_integralClosure_holomorphyRing_subset_integers_iff` is the version over a
  set of places.

## References

* H. Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*, 2nd ed., GTM 254, Springer, 2009,
  Sections III.2 and III.3.  The description of the integral closure of `𝒪_P` in `F'` as the
  intersection of the valuation rings of the places over `P` is the opening result of
  Section III.3, on which its local integral bases rest.

`k`-algebra `R` acting on `F'` through `F`, there is a place `P'` of `F' / k'` at which `z` is
irregular while every function of `R` is regular at the place of `F / k` below `P'`. This
separation statement extends the one-place integral-closure criterion to arbitrary holomorphy

/-- The places of `F' / k'` at which every function of `𝒪'_P` is regular are exactly the places
lying over `P`, so the fibre over `P` is recovered from `𝒪'_P` (Stichtenoth, Corollary 3.2.8 read
through `EpsilonEridani.Place.isIntegral_iff_forall_restrict_eq_mem_integers`).  Unlike the version over
a set of places, this needs no hypothesis on `F / k`. -/
