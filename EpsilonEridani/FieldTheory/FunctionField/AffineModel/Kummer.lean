# Kummer's theorem at an affine model: the places over a place, exactly

Let `F' / k'` be a finite extension of an extension of fields `F / k`, let `R` be an affine model
of `F / k` and let `S` be a module-finite affine model of `F' / k'` over `R`, as in
`EpsilonEridani/FieldTheory/FunctionField/AffineModel/Extension.lean`.  Let `y : S` and let `𝔭` be a
height one prime of `R` **prime to the conductor** of `R[y]` in `S` — Stichtenoth's monogenicity
hypothesis `𝒪'_P = 𝒪_P[y]`, in the form that only asks for it after localizing at `𝔭`.  Then the
factorization

`φ ≡ ∏ᵢ γᵢ ^ εᵢ (mod 𝔭)`,  `φ` the minimal polynomial of `y` over `R`,

determines the places of `F' / k'` over the place of `𝔭` completely: they are in bijection with
the monic irreducible factors `γᵢ`, and the place attached to `γᵢ` has relative degree `deg γᵢ`
and ramification index `εᵢ`.  This is Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*, 2nd ed.,
Corollary 3.3.8 — the conclusion that
`EpsilonEridani/FieldTheory/FunctionField/Place/Extension/Kummer.lean` deliberately does not draw: its
Theorem 3.3.7 bounds the splitting of a place without the monogenicity hypothesis, and neither
computes the ramification indices nor rules out further places over `P`.

The proof is the affine-model dictionary of
`EpsilonEridani/FieldTheory/FunctionField/AffineModel/Extension.lean` — the places over the place of `𝔭`
are the primes of `S` over `𝔭`, with `e` the ramification index and `f` the residue degree of the
centre — composed with the Kummer–Dedekind criterion of
`EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/KummerDedekind.lean`.  Nothing about function fields enters
beyond that dictionary; in particular no hypothesis on `k`, `k'` or the constant fields is needed.

The polynomial being factored is Stichtenoth's `φ`: `R` is integrally closed with fraction field
`F`, so `minpoly R y` maps to `minpoly F y` under `R → F`, by Mathlib's
`minpoly.isIntegrallyClosed_eq_field_fractions`.  The conductor hypothesis holds at every prime
as soon as `S = R[y]`, since then the conductor is the unit ideal by Mathlib's
`conductor_eq_top_of_adjoin_eq_top`.

The places of `F' / k'` outside the finite chart of `S` are reached, as always, by running the
same statement at a second model, exactly as for the fundamental identity.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Place.restrictOfPrimeEquivNormalizedFactors`: the places of `F' / k'` over the place of
  `𝔭`, in bijection with the normalized irreducible factors of `minpoly R y` modulo `𝔭`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Place.restrictOfPrimeEquivNormalizedFactors_symm_apply_coe_eq_ofPrime`: the place
  attached to the class of a lift `Q` is the place of the prime `span (𝔭 S ∪ {Q (y)})` of `S`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.valuation_restrictOfPrimeEquivNormalizedFactors_symm_apply_lt_one`: the place
  attached to a factor is a zero of that factor evaluated at `y`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.relativeDegree_restrictOfPrimeEquivNormalizedFactors_symm_apply`: the relative
  degree of the place attached to a factor is the degree of that factor.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.ramificationIdx_restrictOfPrimeEquivNormalizedFactors_symm_apply`: its
  ramification index is the multiplicity of that factor.
