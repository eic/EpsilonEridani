# Local components of a Weil differential

A `k`-linear form `ω` on the repartition space `A_F` of an algebraic function field `F / k` can be
evaluated on the repartitions supported at a single place: writing `ι_P x` for the repartition
with the entry `x` at `P` and `0` everywhere else, the **local component** of `ω` at `P` is the
`k`-linear form

`ω_P : F → k`, `ω_P x = ω (ι_P x)`

on `F` itself.  When `ω` is a Weil differential the local components determine it, and they do so
by a *sum*: for every repartition `a`, all but finitely many of the values `ω_P (a P)` vanish and

`ω a = ∑_P ω_P (a P)`.

Applying this to the constant repartition of a function `x ∈ F` — which a Weil differential kills,
being a linear form on `A_F / (A_F(D) + F)` — gives `∑_P ω_P (x) = 0`, the **abstract residue
theorem**: it is Stichtenoth's `(1.45)` for `x = 1`, and it holds over an arbitrary constant field,
with no analysis and before any residue map has been constructed.

This is Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*, 2nd ed., Definitions 1.7.1,
Proposition 1.7.2 and the divisor-free half of Proposition 1.7.3(a).  For a function field with
exact constants, the nonvanishing of every local component of a nonzero differential, and hence
the fact that one local component determines the differential, are proved in
`EpsilonEridani.FieldTheory.FunctionField.Differential.LocalNonvanishing`.  The remaining statements of
Section I.7 — that `v_P (ω)` is the largest bound its local component respects and the explicit
generator of `Ω_{k(x)}` — need the divisor of a Weil differential.

The repartitions `ι_P x` themselves are built in
`EpsilonEridani.FieldTheory.FunctionField.Repartition.Basic`, next to the repartition space and its
filtration, which are all they depend on.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.repartitionDualComponent`: the local component `ω_P` of a `k`-linear form on `A_F`
  (Stichtenoth, Definition 1.7.1).

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.repartitionDualComponent_apply_eq_zero_of_le`: the local component at `P` of a Weil
  differential bounded by `D` vanishes on the functions whose pole at `P` is bounded by `D`.
* `EpsilonEridani.repartitionDualComponent_repartitionDualMul_algebraMap`: scaling a linear form by a
  constant scales each of its local components.
* `EpsilonEridani.finite_support_repartitionDualComponent_apply` and
  `EpsilonEridani.apply_eq_finsum_repartitionDualComponent`: **`ω a = ∑_P ω_P (a P)`, with cofinite
  vanishing** (Stichtenoth, Proposition 1.7.2).
* `EpsilonEridani.mem_weilDifferentialFiltration_iff_repartitionDualComponent_eq_zero`: a Weil
  differential is bounded by `D` exactly when each of its local components vanishes on the
  functions `D` allows at that place (Stichtenoth, half of Proposition 1.7.3(a)).
* `EpsilonEridani.finsum_repartitionDualComponent_eq_zero`: **the abstract residue theorem**
  `∑_P ω_P (x) = 0` for every function `x` (Stichtenoth, (1.45)).
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_zero_iff_repartitionDualComponent_eq_zero`: a Weil differential all of whose local
  components vanish is zero.

/-! ### The local components -/

/-- The **local component** `ω_P` at a place `P` of a `k`-linear form `ω` on the repartition space
(Stichtenoth, Definition 1.7.1): the `k`-linear form `x ↦ ω (ι_P x)` on `F`. -/
noncomputable def repartitionDualComponent (ω : Module.Dual k ↥(repartitionSpace k F))

  (rfl)

/-- The local components of a multiple of a linear form: `(f · ω)_P x = ω_P (f x)`.

This is not `@[simp]`: `simp` already proves it from `repartitionDualComponent_apply`,
`repartitionDualMul_apply_apply` and `repartitionMul_singleRepartition`, so tagging it is a
simp-normal-form violation that `scripts/lint-env.sh` rejects. -/

/-- The local components of a constant multiple of a linear form: `(c · ω)_P x = c • ω_P x`.  This
is the case of `EpsilonEridani.repartitionDualComponent_repartitionDualMul` in which the scalar is a
constant, where the multiplication can be pulled out of the linear form. -/

/-- **The local component at `P` of a Weil differential bounded by `D` kills the functions whose
pole at `P` is bounded by `D`**: such an `x` has `ι_P x ∈ A_F(D)`, which `ω` kills. -/

/-- **A finite set of places carrying `ω`**: outside it the values `ω_P (a P)` vanish, and over it
they sum to `ω a` (Stichtenoth, Proposition 1.7.2).  This is the common witness behind the two
public halves, `EpsilonEridani.finite_support_repartitionDualComponent_apply` and
`EpsilonEridani.apply_eq_finsum_repartitionDualComponent`. -/
-- The witness is the support of `E - D` for a divisor `E` bounding `a`: off it the entry `a P` is
-- already bounded by `D`, so `ι_P (a P)` lies in `A_F(D)` and `ω_P (a P) = 0`; and subtracting
-- from `a` the finitely many repartitions `ι_P (a P)` with `P` in that support leaves a
-- repartition bounded by `D`, which `ω` kills.

values `ω_P (a P)` of the local components of a Weil differential vanish at all but finitely many
places `P` (Stichtenoth, Proposition 1.7.2).  It says nothing about a single local component
`ω_P`, which is a linear form on all of `F` and need not vanish anywhere. -/

/-- **A Weil differential is bounded by `D` exactly when its local components are**: the pole
order of `ω` at each place is a local condition, read off from `ω_P` alone.

This is the half of Stichtenoth, Proposition 1.7.3(a) that does not mention the divisor `(ω)`:
the bound at `P` restricts `ω_P` to vanish on the functions whose pole at `P` is bounded by `D`,
and conversely those vanishings force `ω` to kill `A_F(D)`, since `ω` is the sum of its local
components. -/

/-- **The abstract residue theorem** (Stichtenoth, (1.45)): the local components of a Weil
differential sum to zero on every function of `F`.

The constant repartition of `x` lies in the diagonal copy of `F` inside `A_F`, on which every Weil
differential vanishes, and its entry at every place is `x`.  Stichtenoth states the case `x = 1`;
no hypothesis on the constant field `k` is needed, and no residue map has been constructed. -/
