# The different divisor of a finite separable extension

Let `F' / k'` be an extension of the algebraic function field `F / k` with `F' / F` finite and
separable.  The different exponent `d(P' ∣ P)` of
`EpsilonEridani/FieldTheory/FunctionField/Different/Basic.lean` vanishes at all but finitely many places
of `F'`, so the formal sum

`Diff(F'/F) = ∑_{P'} d(P' ∣ P) · P'`

is a divisor of `F' / k'` — the **different divisor** (Stichtenoth, Definition 3.4.3 and
Remark 3.4.4).  It is effective, its support is exactly the set of ramified places, and Dedekind's
different theorem reads on it as `e(P' ∣ P) ≤ Diff(F'/F)(P') + 1`.

## The finiteness

Fix once and for all an `F`-basis `b` of `F'`.  At a place `P` of `F / k` at which every `b i` is
integral and at which the discriminant `disc(b) ∈ F` is a unit, the complementary module of the
local model `𝒪_P ⊆ 𝒪'_P` is `𝒪'_P` itself: Mathlib's
`isIntegral_discr_mul_of_mem_traceDual` makes `disc(b) · x` integral for every `x` of the trace
dual, and dividing by the unit `disc(b)` puts `x` back in `𝒪'_P`.  So the different ideal of the
local model is the unit ideal and `d(P' ∣ P) = 0` for every `P'` over `P`.

Both exceptional conditions hold at only finitely many `P`: the first because a fixed element of
`F'` is integral at almost every place
(`EpsilonEridani.Place.finite_setOf_not_isIntegral`), the second because `disc(b)` is a
nonzero element of `F` and so has finitely many zeros and poles
(`EpsilonEridani.Place.finite_setOf_ord_ne_zero`).  Each of the finitely many exceptional places carries
finitely many places of `F'` (`EpsilonEridani.Place.finite_setOf_restrict_eq`), which bounds the support.

No local integral basis is needed for this, only integrality of the vectors of one fixed global
basis: the discriminant estimate bounds the trace dual of `𝒪'_P` by `disc(b)⁻¹ · 𝒪'_P` for any
integral spanning family, and once `disc(b)` is a unit at `P` that bound already forces equality,
whether or not `b` happens to be an `𝒪_P`-basis of `𝒪'_P`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.different`: the different divisor `Diff(F'/F)`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Place.finite_setOf_differentExponent_ne_zero` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Place.finite_setOf_exists_differentExponent_ne_zero`: the different exponent vanishes
  at all but finitely many places of `F'`, and only finitely many places of `F` ramify.
* `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.zero_le_different`: the different divisor is effective (Stichtenoth,
  Remark 3.4.4).
* `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.mem_support_different_iff_not_isUnramifiedAt`: its support is the set of
  ramified places (Stichtenoth, Corollary 3.5.5).
