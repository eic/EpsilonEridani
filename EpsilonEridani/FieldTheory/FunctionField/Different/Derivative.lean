# The different exponent is bounded by the derivative of a generating equation

Let `F' / k'` be an extension of the field extension `F / k` with `F' / F` finite and separable,
let `P'` be a place of `F'` over the place `P` of `F`, and suppose `F' = F(y)`. If `y` is a root
of a monic polynomial `ψ` with coefficients in the valuation ring `𝒪_P`, then

`d(P' ∣ P) ≤ ord_{P'} (ψ'(y))`

provided `ψ'(y) ≠ 0` (Stichtenoth, Theorem 3.5.10(a), where `ψ` is the minimal polynomial of
`y`). This is the tool that computes different exponents from an explicit equation: a place at
which `ψ'(y)` is a unit is unramified, with `d(P' ∣ P) = 0`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Place.differentExponent_le_ord_aeval_derivative`: `d(P' ∣ P) ≤ ord_{P'} (ψ'(y))`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.differentExponent_eq_zero_of_valuation_aeval_derivative_eq_one`: if `ψ'(y)` is a
  unit at `P'`, then `d(P' ∣ P) = 0`.

/-- **The different exponent is bounded by the derivative of a generating equation**
(Stichtenoth, Theorem 3.5.10(a)): if `F' = F(y)` and `y` is a root of a monic `ψ ∈ F[X]` whose
coefficients are regular at the place `P` below `P'`, then `d(P' ∣ P) ≤ ord_{P'} (ψ'(y))`, as
long as `ψ'(y) ≠ 0`. Stichtenoth takes `ψ` to be the minimal polynomial of `y`; any monic multiple
of it with coefficients in `𝒪_P` works as well. -/
