# Fixed fields of finite automorphism groups of function fields

If a finite group of automorphisms acts on an algebraic function field `F / k`, its fixed field
is again an algebraic function field over `k`. The extension of the fixed field is finite Galois,
and its Galois group is the acting group. This is the field-theoretic input to applying
Riemann--Hurwitz to a quotient by a finite automorphism group.

function field over `k`. `IsGalois.of_fixed_field` makes `F` Galois over
this field, and `FixedPoints.toAlgAutMulEquiv` identifies its Galois group
with `H`. -/
