# Strong approximation for an algebraic function field

Weak approximation (`EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_forall_mem_ord_sub_eq`) prescribes the behaviour of a
function at finitely many places of `F / k` and says nothing whatever about the remaining ones.
**Strong approximation** keeps that prescription and adds regularity at every place of a set `S`
which misses at least one place of `F / k`: given such an `S`, a finite subset `s ⊆ S`, targets
`f P` and prescribed orders `r P`, there is a single `x : F` with

`ord_P (x - f P) = r P` for every `P ∈ s`, and `x ∈ 𝒪_P` for every `P ∈ S` outside `s`.

Some freedom is what pays for the extra control, and the properness of `S` is exactly that
freedom: for `S` the set of *all* places the statement is false, because a function regular at
every place is a constant (`EpsilonEridani.Place.coe_algebraicClosure_eq_iInter_integers`).

This is Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*, 2nd ed., Theorem 1.6.5.  Unlike weak
approximation it is a consequence of Riemann's theorem, and it is the form of approximation that
consumers working inside a holomorphy ring `𝒪_S` want.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_forall_mem_valuation_sub_le_and_forall_mem_integers`: strong
  approximation in the inequality form, `ord_P (x - f P) ≥ r P` on `s` and integrality on the
  rest of `S`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Place.exists_forall_mem_ord_sub_eq_and_forall_mem_integers`: **strong approximation**
  (Stichtenoth, Theorem 1.6.5), with the orders on `s` prescribed exactly.

## Implementation notes

The proof is the repartition-space argument.  Take a place `Q ∉ S` and let `E` be the divisor
with coefficient `-r P` at each `P ∈ s` and `n` copies of `Q`, with `n` large enough that `E` is
nonspecial; the enlargement happens at `Q` alone, so it disturbs no coefficient of `E` at a place
of `S`.  Then `A_F(E) + F = A_F`
(`EpsilonEridani.adeleFiltration_sup_diagonalRepartitions_eq_repartitionSpace_iff`), so the repartition
carrying `f P` at each `P ∈ s` and `0` elsewhere differs from a *constant* `x` by a repartition
bounded by `E`.  Reading that bound off place by place gives both conclusions at once: at `P ∈ s`
it is the approximation `ord_P (x - f P) ≥ r P`, and at the other places of `S`, where `E` has
coefficient `0` and the repartition has entry `0`, it is the integrality of `x`.

The inequality form is stated multiplicatively, as `v_P (x - f P) ≤ exp (-r P)`, for the reason
recorded in `EpsilonEridani/FieldTheory/FunctionField/Repartition/Basic.lean`: the additive reading
`r P ≤ ord_P (x - f P)` is wrong at `x = f P`, where the junk value `ord_P 0 = 0` would exclude
an exact hit whenever `r P > 0`.  No such guard is needed in the equality form, whose conclusion
`ord_P (x - f P) = r P` already forces `x ≠ f P` when `r P ≠ 0`.

/-- **Strong approximation, in the inequality form** (Stichtenoth, Theorem 1.6.5): for a set `S`
of places of `F / k` that is not all of them and a finite subset `s ⊆ S`, some `x : F`
approximates the target `f P` to order `r P` at every `P ∈ s` and is regular at every place of
`S` outside `s`.

The approximation is the multiplicative bound `v_P (x - f P) ≤ exp (-r P)`, which reads
`ord_P (x - f P) ≥ r P` at every place where `x ≠ f P` and is satisfied outright where
`x = f P`. -/
