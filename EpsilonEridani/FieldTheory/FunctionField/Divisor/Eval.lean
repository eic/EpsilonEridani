# Evaluating a function on a divisor

For a function `f` and a divisor `D` whose support avoids the zeros and poles of `f`, the
classical quantity

`f(D) = ∏_{P ∈ supp D} N_{F_P/k}(f(P)) ^ (coeff D P)`

is what Weil reciprocity `f(div g) = g(div f)` compares. This file defines it. The local factors
`N_{F_P/k}(f(P))` are `EpsilonEridani.Place.normResidueOrOne`, built in
`FieldTheory/FunctionField/Place/Residue.lean`.

The construction is total on `Fˣ` — every nonzero function, at every divisor — and classical
where both the admissibility and the finiteness conditions below hold: at a place
whose residue field is module-finite over `k`. `EpsilonEridani.Place.finiteDimensional_residueField`
supplies that at every place of an algebraic function field; absent it, `Algebra.norm` is the junk
value `1` and the factor drops out silently, which is the convention `EpsilonEridani.Place.degree`
already follows (junk `0` under the same hypothesis). No result below is stated only in the
classical regime — the divisor and function laws are formal and hold for every `F`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.eval`: `f(D)`, as a unit of `k`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.IsUnitAtSupport`: the admissibility condition — `f` is a unit at every place of
  `D`. This is exactly disjointness of `D` from the divisor of `f`
  (`isUnitAtSupport_iff_disjoint`).

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.eval_add`, `eval_neg`, `eval_sub`, `eval_zero`: `f(-)` is a homomorphism from
  the additive group of divisors to `kˣ`, unconditionally.
* `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.eval_eq_prod_normResidue`: on an admissible divisor, the textbook product
  formula.
* `EpsilonEridani.Divisor.eval_one`, `eval_inv`, `eval_mul` and `eval_div`: the group laws in the
  *function* variable. The bundled homomorphism supplies the divisor variable; these supply the
  other one, and
  the two together are the bilinearity Weil reciprocity is stated against. Note the asymmetry:
  `eval_one` and `eval_inv` need no hypothesis, while `eval_mul` and `eval_div` need admissibility
  for both arguments.
* Admissibility is a subgroup condition in *each* variable, which is what makes those laws usable
  together: `isUnitAtSupport_one`, `IsUnitAtSupport.mul`, `isUnitAtSupport_inv_iff` and
  `IsUnitAtSupport.div` in the function, and `isUnitAtSupport_zero`, `IsUnitAtSupport.add`,
  `isUnitAtSupport_neg_iff` and `IsUnitAtSupport.sub` in the divisor. The divisor side is what
  moving a divisor within its class to obtain disjoint support needs.

## Implementation notes

Three choices are load-bearing, and each rules out an alternative that does not work.

**Functions are taken in `Fˣ`, not `F`.** The admissibility condition is `P.ord f = 0`, and
`P.ord 0 = 0` by the junk-value convention on `ord`; so over `F` the condition would declare
`f = 0` admissible at every place. Taking `f : Fˣ` excludes that, and it matches
`EpsilonEridani.Divisor.principal`, which is already stated for `Fˣ`.

**Values are taken in `kˣ`, not `k`, and the neutral value is `1`, not `0`.** The coefficient of a
place is an integer, so the local factor is raised to a possibly negative power, and the divisor law
has to survive that. With `0` as the neutral value in `k` it does not: at a place where `f` is not a
unit, `eval (single P 1) * eval (single P (-1))` would be `0` while `eval 0 = 1`. In `kˣ` every
`zpow` identity holds unconditionally and the law is automatic.

**The definition is total, with admissibility carried by the theorems.** Admissibility depends on
the divisor, so a definition that demanded it could not be a homomorphism on the divisor group: it
would be one on the subgroup of divisors admissible for that particular `f` — a domain that shrinks
with each `f`, which `IsUnitAtSupport.zero`, `.add`, `isUnitAtSupport_neg_iff` and `.sub` below
describe. Instead `Place.normResidueOrOne` is total, `eval` is a homomorphism on the whole group,
and `eval_eq_prod_normResidue` recovers the textbook formula wherever
admissibility holds.

/-- **The value `f(D)` of a function on a divisor.**

Two conditions separate this from the classical quantity, and both have to hold. `f` must be a
unit at every place of `D` (`EpsilonEridani.Divisor.IsUnitAtSupport`): the local factor is total, so at a
zero or pole of `f` it is `1` rather than a norm, and that factor silently disappears. And every
residue field involved must be module-finite over `k`, or `Algebra.norm` degenerates to `1` for
the same reason (`Algebra.norm_eq_one_of_not_module_finite`).
`EpsilonEridani.Place.finiteDimensional_residueField` supplies the second at every place of an algebraic
function field, so in the intended setting only admissibility is a real hypothesis — but it is
one. See `EpsilonEridani.Place.normResidue` for the full statement of the finiteness convention, which is
the one `EpsilonEridani.Place.degree` already follows. -/
