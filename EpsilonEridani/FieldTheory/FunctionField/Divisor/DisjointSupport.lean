# Moving a divisor within its class to avoid finitely many places

Every divisor class of an algebraic function field contains a representative whose support misses
any prescribed finite set of places:

```
∀ D, ∀ s : Finset (Place k F), ∃ D' ~ D, Disjoint D'.support s.
```

Weak approximation is what makes this true. Finitely many distinct places impose independent
conditions on `F`, so there is a function whose order at each place of `s` is exactly the negative
of the coefficient of `D` there; adding its divisor cancels `D` on `s` and changes nothing about
the class.

/-- **Every divisor class has a representative avoiding a given finite set of places.**

Evaluating a function on a divisor requires the divisor's support to miss the function's zeros and
poles; this is what makes that arrangeable, by replacing the divisor with a linearly equivalent one
that avoids them. Weil reciprocity and the divisor construction of the Weil pairing both need the
move. -/
