# A quadratic extension away from characteristic two is separable

An extension of fields of degree `2` is separable unless `2 = 0` in the base field. Indeed the
separable degree divides the degree, so it is `1` or `2`; the value `2` is separability itself,
while the value `1` makes the extension purely inseparable, hence of degree a power of the
exponential characteristic — and `2` is a power of the exponential characteristic only in
characteristic two.

The characteristic-two exception is genuine: over `K = 𝔽₂(t)` the extension `K(√t) / K` has
degree `2` and is purely inseparable.

/-- **A field extension of degree two with `2 ≠ 0` in the base field is separable.**

The hypothesis is the nonvanishing of `2` in the base field rather than a `CharP` assumption, so
that it transfers along any field extension by injectivity of the structure map. -/
