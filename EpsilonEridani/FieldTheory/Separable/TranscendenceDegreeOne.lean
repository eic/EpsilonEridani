# Separating elements in transcendence degree one

A finitely generated extension of a perfect field admits a finite separating transcendence
basis.  When the extension has transcendence degree one, that basis consists of one element.
Thus there is a transcendental `x` such that the extension is separable algebraic over the
simple field `k(x)`.

This is the one-variable form of Mathlib's
`exists_isTranscendenceBasis_and_isSeparable_of_perfectField`.  It is useful for passing from
abstract separable generation to constructions that require a single separating parameter.
