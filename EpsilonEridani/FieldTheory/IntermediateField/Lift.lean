# Intermediate fields of an intermediate field

For `E` an intermediate field of `L / F`, the intermediate fields of `E / F` are the intermediate
fields of `L / F` lying below `E`. Mathlib supplies the two maps — `IntermediateField.lift` and
`IntermediateField.restrict` — and one of the two round trips (`lift_restrict`). This file adds
the other round trip and the order-embedding statement, and packages them as an order
isomorphism

`IntermediateField F E ≃o Set.Iic E`.

Having the correspondence as a single `OrderIso` rather than as a pair of monotone maps is what
lets it be composed with the Galois correspondence, which is also an `OrderIso`; that composition
is the subfield dictionary of
`EpsilonEridani/FieldTheory/Galois/SubfieldDictionary.lean`.

## Main results

* `IntermediateField.restrict_lift`: restricting a lifted intermediate field recovers it. This
  is the round trip Mathlib does not state; `lift_restrict` is the other one.
* `IntermediateField.lift_le_lift_iff`: `lift` reflects as well as preserves the order.
* `IntermediateField.liftOrderIso`: the resulting order isomorphism with `Set.Iic E`, with
  `IntermediateField.liftOrderIso_apply` and `IntermediateField.liftOrderIso_symm_apply` giving
  its two directions as `lift` and `restrict`.
