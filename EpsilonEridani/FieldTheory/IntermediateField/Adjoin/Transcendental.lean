# Linear independence over a simple transcendental extension

Combined with the tower rule for linear independence, a family that is linearly independent over
the simple extension `k⟮x⟯` stays linearly independent over `k` after multiplying by arbitrary
powers of a transcendental element `x`.

The second statement is the source of dimension growth in the theory of algebraic function
fields: multiplying a basis of `F / k⟮x⟯` by the powers `1, x, …, xⁿ` exhibits `(n + 1) [F : k(x)]`
functions that are independent over `k` and whose poles are controlled by those of `x`.

## Main results

* `Transcendental.linearIndependent_mul_pow`: a `k⟮x⟯`-linearly independent family in
  `F`, multiplied by the powers of a transcendental `x`, is `k`-linearly independent.
* `Transcendental.linearIndependent_mul_pow_fin`: the finite-power restriction used in
  dimension estimates.

/-- **The growth family**: multiplying a `k⟮x⟯`-linearly independent family by the powers of a
transcendental element `x` yields a `k`-linearly independent family.  This is Mathlib's tower rule
`linearIndependent_smul`, applied to the powers of `x` inside `k⟮x⟯`. -/
