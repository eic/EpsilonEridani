# Adjoining roots of finitely many elements

For finitely many elements of a field `F` and `0 < n`, there is a finite extension of `F` in
which each of them has an `n`-th root: adjoin the roots inside an algebraic closure.

Nothing here is specific to purely inseparable extensions or to a characteristic exponent; the
result is stated for an arbitrary positive power.

It has no consumer in this repository yet. The motivating application is the `L'` of Stacks
10.161.13 (tag 032O), feeding `RingTheory/IntegralClosure/NormalizationFinite`: the embedding
theorem in `EpsilonEridani/FieldTheory/PurelyInseparable/Embedding.lean` assumes exactly such an
extension as a hypothesis rather than building one, so it does not use this lemma.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_finiteDimensional_forall_exists_pow_eq`: a finite extension of `F` containing
  `n`-th roots of finitely many given elements of `F`.

## Provenance

The construction is the finite root-adjoining step appearing in Stacks, Lemma 10.161.13
(tag 032O), in the normalization-finiteness argument described above.

/-- For finitely many elements `s` of a field `F` and `0 < n`, there is a finite extension `E` of
`F` in which every `c ∈ s` has an `n`-th root: adjoin the roots inside an algebraic closure. Both
conjuncts concern the same witness `E`, which is why they are bundled.

This is the shape the construction of the extension `L′` in Stacks, Lemma 10.161.13 (tag 032O)
needs —
"There exists a finite purely inseparable field extension `L′/K` and `q = p^e` such that
`L ⊂ L′(x^{1/q})`" — but is NOT that extension: nothing here asserts that `E / F` is purely
inseparable, only that it is finite and contains the required roots. -/
