# Polynomials with full symmetric Galois group

`Polynomial.HasFullSymmetricGaloisGroup f` requires separability and surjectivity of
the Galois action on the roots in the splitting field. Separability ensures that this is the
symmetric group on `f.natDegree` points, rather than on a smaller set of distinct roots.
The predicate is also available as `f.HasFullSymmetricGaloisGroup` by dot notation.

The property can be checked in any field where `f` splits, or by checking that the Galois
group has order `f.natDegree!`. A numbering of the roots gives an explicit group isomorphism
with the permutations of `Fin f.natDegree`. These interfaces connect reduction criteria
for Galois groups with realizations of symmetric groups over the rational numbers.
