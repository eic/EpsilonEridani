# The Galois group of a cubic

An irreducible separable cubic has transitive Galois image in `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)`, and the only
transitive subgroups of the symmetric group on three points are the alternating group `A₃`, the
reference subgroup of the label `3T1`, and the whole group `S₃`, that of `3T2`. So such a cubic
carries exactly one label, and which one is decided by parity: away from characteristic `2` the
Galois image lies in the alternating group exactly when the discriminant is a square. The
discriminant therefore determines the Galois group of an irreducible separable cubic on its
own: the label is `3T1` when `f.discr` is a square and `3T2` when it is not.

The two classical examples over `ℚ` are computed in full. The cubic `X³ - 3X - 1` has discriminant
`81 = 9²`, so its Galois group is cyclic of order three; the cubic `X³ - 2` has discriminant
`-108`, which is not a square in `ℚ` since it is negative, so its Galois group is `S₃`, of order
six. Irreducibility over `ℚ` is checked by the integral root theorem and a reduction modulo a small
prime.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.existsUnique_hasGaloisLabel_three`: an irreducible separable cubic carries exactly one
  label.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasGaloisLabel_three_zero_iff`, `EpsilonEridani.hasGaloisLabel_three_one_iff`: **the
  discriminant decides the label of a cubic**, `3T1` for a square discriminant and `3T2`
  otherwise.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasGaloisLabel_X_pow_three_sub_three_mul_X_sub_one`: `X³ - 3X - 1` over `ℚ` has label
  `3T1`, and `EpsilonEridani.natCard_gal_X_pow_three_sub_three_mul_X_sub_one`: its Galois group has
  order `3`.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasGaloisLabel_X_pow_three_sub_two`: `X³ - 2` over `ℚ` has label `3T2`, and
  `EpsilonEridani.natCard_gal_X_pow_three_sub_two`: its Galois group has order `6`.
