# Degree of the root permutation representation

This file records the degree bookkeeping for the faithful permutation representation of the
Galois group of a polynomial. A separable polynomial has `natDegree` distinct roots in its
splitting field, so its intrinsic root set admits a numbering by `Fin p.natDegree`. No numbering
is chosen globally: the result is stated as a `Nonempty` equivalence, leaving later comparisons
with reference permutation groups to carry their chosen numbering explicitly.

The Galois action itself is faithful over every splitting extension. Consequently its image has
the same cardinality as the polynomial Galois group, and the Galois-group order divides the
factorial of the polynomial degree.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.nonempty_rootSet_splittingField_equiv_fin`: a separable polynomial's roots in its
  splitting field can be numbered by `Fin p.natDegree`.
* `EpsilonEridani.natCard_galActionHom_range`: the faithful Galois image has the order of the polynomial
  Galois group.
* `EpsilonEridani.natCard_gal_dvd_factorial_card_rootSet`: the Galois-group order divides the factorial
  of the number of distinct roots.
* `EpsilonEridani.natCard_gal_dvd_factorial_natDegree`: the order of a polynomial's Galois group divides
  the factorial of its degree.

The proofs reuse Mathlib's `Polynomial.card_rootSet_eq_natDegree`,
`Polynomial.Gal.galActionHom_injective`, `MonoidHom.ofInjective`, and Lagrange's theorem. This is
the degree bookkeeping used by the orbit-to-factor dictionary and by low-degree label predicates.

/-- A separable polynomial's roots in its splitting field admit a numbering by
`Fin p.natDegree`.

Only existence is recorded: later statements choose a numbering locally, so the intrinsic root
set is not equipped with a global order. -/
