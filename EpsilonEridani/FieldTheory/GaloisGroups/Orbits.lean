# Galois orbits on the roots of a polynomial

Let `p` be a polynomial over a field `F` and let `E` be an extension in which `p` splits. The
Galois group `Polynomial.Gal p` acts on `p.rootSet E`, and this file identifies the orbits of
that action with the monic irreducible factors of `p`.

The invariant that separates the orbits is the minimal polynomial: two roots lie in the same
orbit exactly when they have the same minimal polynomial over `F`, so the orbit of a root is the
whole root set of its minimal polynomial. When `p` is nonzero, passing to the orbit quotient
turns this into a bijection with the distinct monic irreducible factors of `p`, that is, with
the members of `Polynomial.Factors p`.

The dictionary also identifies transitivity of the root action with irreducibility for a
separable polynomial of positive degree, and records the same descriptions for the action inside
the splitting field itself, where an irreducible polynomial acts transitively.

For the intrinsic action, this file also records the evaluation rule on the splitting field and
the instances identifying `Polynomial.Gal p` as a Galois group for that field over the base.

## Main results

* `Polynomial.Gal.galActionHom_eq_permCongr`: the root permutations in two splitting extensions
  correspond under `Polynomial.Gal.rootsEquivRoots`.
* `EpsilonEridani.mem_orbit_iff_minpoly_eq`: two roots of `p` are in the same Galois orbit exactly when
  their minimal polynomials agree.
* `EpsilonEridani.image_val_orbit_eq_rootSet_minpoly`: read inside `E`, the orbit of a root is the root
  set of its minimal polynomial.
* `EpsilonEridani.natCard_orbit_eq_natDegree_minpoly`: when the corresponding minimal polynomial is
  separable, an orbit has as many elements as its degree.
* `EpsilonEridani.natCard_rootSet_complex_eq_natDegree`: an integral polynomial with nonzero
  discriminant has as many distinct complex roots as its degree.
* `EpsilonEridani.isPretransitive_iff_irreducible`: for separable `p` of positive degree, transitivity
  of the root action is equivalent to irreducibility of `p`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isPretransitive_range_galActionHom`: the Galois image of an irreducible polynomial,
  as a group of permutations of the roots, is transitive.
* `EpsilonEridani.mem_orbit_iff_minpoly_eq_splittingField`,
  `EpsilonEridani.image_val_orbit_eq_rootSet_minpoly_splittingField`,
  `EpsilonEridani.natCard_orbit_eq_natDegree_minpoly_splittingField`: the same three descriptions of an
  orbit for the intrinsic action on the roots in the splitting field.
* `EpsilonEridani.isPretransitive_of_irreducible`: inside the splitting field, an irreducible
  polynomial has a transitive root action.
* `Polynomial.Gal.smul_eq_apply`: the action on the splitting field is evaluation.
* `EpsilonEridani.galIsGaloisGroup`: `Polynomial.Gal p` is a Galois group for its splitting field.
* `EpsilonEridani.orbitQuotientEquivFactors`: the orbit quotient is in bijection with the
  monic irreducible factors of `p`, the orbit of a root going to its minimal polynomial.
* `EpsilonEridani.natCard_orbit_eq_natDegree_factor`: along that bijection, a separable
  factor has as many roots in the matching orbit as its degree.

/-! ## Transitivity and irreducibility -/

/-- For a separable polynomial of positive degree, the Galois action on the roots in a splitting
extension is transitive exactly when the polynomial is irreducible.

Separability cannot be dropped: over `ℚ` the polynomial `(X ^ 2 - 2) ^ 2` is reducible, yet its
Galois group acts transitively on its two distinct roots. Without separability the forward
implication only says that `p` is a unit times a power of one irreducible polynomial. -/

/- The results below are about `p.rootSet p.SplittingField` carrying Mathlib's
`Polynomial.Gal.galActionAux`, the intrinsic action for which `↑(g • x)` is literally `g ↑x`.
That is not the instance `E := p.SplittingField` gives the results above: those use
`Polynomial.Gal.galAction`, the transport of `galActionAux` along `Gal.rootsEquivRoots`, which
goes through the `Algebra p.SplittingField p.SplittingField` instance built from
`IsSplittingField.lift` rather than through the identity. So no `Fact` instance is introduced
here; the orbit descriptions are obtained by feeding the intrinsic orbit criterion to the same
proofs as above, and transitivity is proved directly rather than read off
`EpsilonEridani.isPretransitive_iff_irreducible` or `Polynomial.Gal.galAction_isPretransitive`. -/
