# Resolvents and transitive-group labels

The resolvent criterion of `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.exists_isRoot_specialize_iff_exists_le_map_conj`
compares the roots of a specialized resolvent in the base field with the Galois image of `f` read
through a numbering of its roots. That image is only defined up to a numbering, while the
transitive-group label `EpsilonEridani.HasGaloisLabel` of `f` is not, so the criterion is restated here
against the label: a resolvent of `f` has a root in the base field exactly when the reference
subgroup of the label of `f` lies in a conjugate of the subgroup of the specification.

One direction assumes nothing about the resolvent; the converse needs the specialized resolvent
to be separable, since two orbit values that collide at the roots of `f` produce a root of the
resolvent that constrains the Galois image no further.

This is what turns a resolvent into a test on labels: for a fixed degree, the labels whose
reference subgroup is conjugate into the subgroup of the specification can be listed once and for
all as a statement of permutation group theory, and the resolvent then decides membership in that
list.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.HasGaloisLabel.exists_isRoot_specialize_of_exists_le_map_conj`: a label whose reference
  subgroup lies in a conjugate of the subgroup of the specification gives the resolvent a root in
  the base field.
* `EpsilonEridani.HasGaloisLabel.exists_isRoot_specialize_iff`: conversely for a separable specialized
  resolvent, so that the resolvent decides the containment.

/-- **A label confined to the subgroup of a specification gives the resolvent a root.** If the
reference subgroup of the label of a monic `f` lies in a conjugate of the subgroup of a resolvent
specification, then the resolvent of `f` has a root in the base field. Nothing is assumed about
the resolvent. -/

/-- **The resolvent criterion, read on the label.** Let `f` be monic with a transitive-group
label, and let the resolvent of `f` for a specification be separable. The resolvent then has a
root in the base field exactly when the reference subgroup of the label of `f` lies in a
conjugate of the subgroup of the specification.

Separability of the resolvent is what the forward implication needs; the reverse implication is
`EpsilonEridani.HasGaloisLabel.exists_isRoot_specialize_of_exists_le_map_conj`, which assumes nothing
about the resolvent. -/
