# The quintic `F₂₀` resolvent specification and the resolvent sextic

Index five formal roots by `ℤ/5` and set

`Φ = ∑ a, xₐ² (xₐ₊₁ xₐ₋₁ + xₐ₊₂ xₐ₋₂)`,

the ten monomials `x₀²x₁x₄ + x₀²x₂x₃ + x₁²x₂x₀ + x₁²x₃x₄ + ⋯`. The stabilizer of `Φ` under
permutation of the variables is exactly the reference subgroup of the transitive-group label
`5T3`, the Frobenius group `F₂₀ = AGL(1, 5)` of affine maps of `ℤ/5`, of order twenty: the
affine maps `a ↦ a + 1` and `a ↦ 2a + 1` that generate it permute the summands of `Φ`. The
orbit of `Φ` under the whole symmetric group therefore has `120 / 20 = 6` elements, and the
orbit resolvent of a quintic is a sextic.

That the stabilizer is *exactly* `F₂₀`, and not merely contained in it, identifies the six
universal orbit elements with the cosets `S₅ / F₂₀`. After specialization their values may still
collide, so using a rational root to detect containment in a conjugate of `F₂₀` requires
separation evidence, for example a nonzero discriminant of the specialized sextic.

`EpsilonEridani.resolventSextic f` is the specialization of this specification at a quintic `f` over
`ℤ`. Integrality is a theorem about `ResolventSpec.specialize` and not an extra hypothesis, so
the sextic is a monic integral polynomial of degree six; the sextic over `ℚ` is its image under
`Polynomial.map`, by `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.specialize_map`. Being monic and integral, any
rational root is integral, reducing the rational-root search to integers; concluding containment
from such a root separately requires the separation evidence above.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.quinticF20Invariant`: the invariant `Φ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.quinticF20Spec`: the resolvent specification of `Φ`, for the subgroup `5T3`.
* `EpsilonEridani.resolventSextic`: the resolvent sextic of an integral quintic.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.rename_quinticF20Invariant_eq_self_iff`: the stabilizer of the invariant is exactly
  the reference subgroup of `5T3`.
* `EpsilonEridani.card_renameOrbit_quinticF20Invariant`: its orbit has six elements.
* `EpsilonEridani.natDegree_resolventSextic`: the resolvent sextic has degree six.

## References

* D. S. Dummit, *Solving solvable quintics*, Mathematics of Computation **57** (1991), §2,
