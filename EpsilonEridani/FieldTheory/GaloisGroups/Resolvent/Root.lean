# Roots of a resolvent in the base field

A resolvent specification `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec n` carries an invariant `Φ` in `n` formal roots
whose stabilizer under renaming the variables is exactly its subgroup `H ≤ Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`.
Specializing it at a monic separable `f : F[X]` of degree `n` gives
`EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.specialize`, a monic polynomial over `F` whose image in an extension `E`
where `f` splits is the product of `X - Ψ(x)` over the orbit of `Φ`, evaluated at the roots `x`
of `f`.

This file compares the roots of that polynomial in `F` with the Galois group. Numbering the roots
of `f` in `E` by an equivalence `e : f.rootSet E ≃ Fin n` turns the image of the Galois action on
the roots into a subgroup of `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`. An automorphism of `E` over `F` carries the
value of `Φ` at the roots to the value of the invariant renamed along the permutation it induces,
so that value is fixed by the whole Galois group, hence lies in `F`, as soon as the image lies in
`H`; and it is a root of the resolvent. Renaming the invariant, the resolvent therefore has a root
in `F` whenever the image lies in a conjugate of `H`. That direction assumes nothing about the
resolvent.

The converse does assume something. After specialization two distinct elements of the orbit may
take the same value at the roots of `f`, and a root of the resolvent then no longer singles out
one coset of `H`. Separability of the specialized resolvent rules this out: it makes the values of
the orbit pairwise distinct, so a root in `F` is the value of exactly one renamed invariant, that
invariant is fixed by every element of the Galois image, and the image lies in its stabilizer,
which is a conjugate of `H`.

Both readings pass through a numbering of the roots, while the resolvent itself and the property
of being conjugate into `H` do not depend on one.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.exists_isRoot_specialize_of_le` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.exists_isRoot_specialize_of_le_map_conj`: a Galois image inside `H`,
  respectively inside a conjugate of `H`, gives the resolvent a root in the base field.
* `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.exists_le_map_conj_of_isRoot_specialize`: conversely, when the
  specialized resolvent is separable, a root of it in the base field confines the Galois image to
  a conjugate of `H`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.exists_isRoot_specialize_iff_exists_le_map_conj`: the two together, the
  criterion that a separable resolvent provides.

/-! ## From the Galois image to a root of the resolvent -/

/-- **A Galois image inside `H` gives the resolvent a root in the base field.** If, read through
some numbering of the roots of a monic separable `f` of degree `n` in a Galois splitting extension
`E`, the image of the Galois action lies in the subgroup of the specification, then the value of
the invariant at those roots is fixed by every automorphism of `E` over `F`, hence lies in `F`,
and it is a root of the resolvent of `f`.

Nothing is assumed about the resolvent here; the converse
`EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.exists_le_map_conj_of_isRoot_specialize` does assume its separability. -/

/-! ## From a root of a separable resolvent to the Galois image -/

/-- **A root of a separable resolvent confines the Galois image to a conjugate of `H`.** Let `f`
be monic and separable of degree `n`, let `E` be a normal splitting extension, and let the
resolvent of `f` for the specification be separable. The values of the orbit of the invariant at
the roots of `f` are then pairwise distinct, so a root of the resolvent in `F` is the value of
exactly one renamed invariant; that invariant is fixed by every element of the Galois image, which
therefore lies in its stabilizer, a conjugate of `H`.

Separability of the resolvent is what makes the argument work, and it cannot be dropped: two
cosets whose invariants happen to collide at the roots of a particular `f` produce a root of the
resolvent in `F` that constrains the Galois image no further. The opposite implication,
`EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.exists_isRoot_specialize_of_le_map_conj`, holds unconditionally. -/
