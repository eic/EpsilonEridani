# Resolvent specifications

A resolvent tests whether the Galois group of a polynomial of degree `n`, viewed as a subgroup of
`Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` through a numbering of the roots, lies in a conjugate of a subgroup `H`. The
test is built from an invariant `Φ` in `n` formal roots whose stabilizer under permutation of the
variables is *exactly* `H`: the orbit of `Φ` is then in bijection with the cosets of `H`, and the
factorization of the orbit product records how the Galois group permutes those cosets. A mere
containment of `H` in the stabilizer would not let the resolvent detect `H`.

A `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec n` packages this universal data once, independently of any polynomial or
coefficient ring: the subgroup, the integral invariant, the exact stabilizer statement, and the
unique integral expression of the orbit product in the elementary symmetric polynomials. The
last field is determined by the invariant (`MvPolynomial.existsUnique_orbitProduct`), and so is
the subgroup, so a specification is determined by its invariant (`EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.ext`).

Specializing at a polynomial `f` over any commutative ring substitutes the signed coefficients of
`f` for the elementary symmetric polynomials. The result is monic of degree the index `[Sₙ : H]`
over every nonzero ring, commutes with every ring morphism applied to the coefficients, and, when
the roots of `f` are listed with multiplicity in a domain, is the orbit product of the values of
the orbit of `Φ` at those roots.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec`: a resolvent specification.
* `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.mk'`: the specification attached to an invariant with prescribed exact
  stabilizer, with its orbit product supplied by the symmetric descent.
* `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.specialize`: the resolvent of a polynomial over a commutative ring.
* `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.rename`: the specification of a renamed invariant, for the conjugate
  subgroup.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.ext`: a specification is determined by its invariant.
* `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.specialize_map`: specialization commutes with base change.
* `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.monic_specialize` and `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.natDegree_specialize`: the
  resolvent is monic of degree `[Sₙ : H]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.map_specialize_eq_galResolvent`: the resolvent is the orbit product at
  the roots.
* `EpsilonEridani.ResolventSpec.specialize_rename`: renaming the invariant does not change the
  resolvent.
