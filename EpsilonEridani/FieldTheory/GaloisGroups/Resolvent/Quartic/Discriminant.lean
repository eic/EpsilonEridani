# Discriminants of quartics and their resolvent cubics

A monic quartic of degree four and the cubic obtained by specializing `quarticD4Spec` have the
same discriminant. Consequently, the specialized resolvent is separable exactly when the quartic
is separable, so downstream quartic Galois-group criteria require no additional separation
hypothesis.

For the depressed quartic

`X⁴ + pX² + qX + r`

and its cubic resolvent

`X³ - pX² - 4rX + (4pr - q²)`

the specialized resolvent is `EpsilonEridani.resolventCubic p q r`, giving the corresponding closed-form
identity and separability results. All these statements hold over an arbitrary commutative ring.

## Main results

* `Polynomial.Monic.discr_of_natDegree_eq_four`: the coefficient formula for the discriminant of
  a monic quartic.
* `EpsilonEridani.discr_depressedQuartic`: the explicit discriminant of a depressed quartic.
* `EpsilonEridani.discr_quarticD4Spec_specialize`: a monic quartic of degree four and its specialized
  resolvent have equal discriminants.
* `EpsilonEridani.separable_quarticD4Spec_specialize_iff`: the quartic is separable exactly when its
  specialized resolvent is.
* `EpsilonEridani.discr_resolventCubic`: a depressed quartic and its resolvent cubic have equal
  discriminants.
* `EpsilonEridani.separable_resolventCubic_iff`: the quartic is separable exactly when its resolvent is.
* `EpsilonEridani.separable_resolventCubic`: a separable quartic has a separable resolvent cubic.
