# The subfield dictionary for a field that need not be Galois

Mathlib's fundamental theorem of Galois theory, `IsGalois.intermediateFieldEquivSubgroup`,
describes the intermediate fields of a **Galois** extension `L / F` as the subgroups of
`Gal(L/F)`. It says nothing directly about the intermediate fields of `K / F` for an
intermediate field `K` that is not itself Galois over `F` — and for a general number field `K`
that is exactly the case of interest, `K` being presented inside its normal closure.

The correct statement is a relative one. The intermediate fields of `K / F` are an *interval*:
they are the intermediate fields of `L / F` below `K`, and under the Galois correspondence those
are the subgroups of `Gal(L/F)` **containing** `K.fixingSubgroup`. So

`IntermediateField F K ≃o (Set.Ici K.fixingSubgroup)ᵒᵈ`,

order-reversing, with the bottom `F` matching the top `⊤` and the top `K` matching
`K.fixingSubgroup` itself. Nothing here needs `K / F` to be normal; only `L / F` is Galois.

Both steps are existing order isomorphisms, composed:

* `IntermediateField.liftOrderIso` identifies `IntermediateField F K` with the interval
  `Set.Iic K` inside `IntermediateField F L`, replacing the abstract field `K` by a subfield of
  `L` (`EpsilonEridani/FieldTheory/IntermediateField/Lift.lean`);
* `OrderIso.Iic` restricts the Galois correspondence itself to that interval. Its codomain,
  `Set.Iic (IsGalois.intermediateFieldEquivSubgroup K)`, is the down-set of
  `OrderDual.toDual K.fixingSubgroup` in `(Subgroup Gal(L/F))ᵒᵈ`, which is definitionally
  `(Set.Ici K.fixingSubgroup)ᵒᵈ` — so the composition needs no bridging step.

## Main results

* `IntermediateField.intermediateFieldEquivSubgroup`: the dictionary,
  `IntermediateField F K ≃o (Set.Ici K.fixingSubgroup)ᵒᵈ`.

The evaluation rules for `OrderIso.Iic`, which Mathlib does not state, are in
`EpsilonEridani/Order/Hom/Set.lean`.
