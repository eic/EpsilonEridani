# Stabilizers for the Krull topology are open

`Mathlib/FieldTheory/KrullTopology.lean` supplies the Krull topology on `Gal(L/K)` together with
`stabilizer_isOpen_of_isIntegral`, the fact that a point of an integral extension `L/K` has an
**open** stabilizer. This file draws the consequence for a *unit* of `L`, an automorphism fixing
a unit being exactly one that fixes the underlying element.

Through Mathlib's `continuousSMul_iff_stabilizer_isOpen` this is what makes the units of an
algebraic extension a *discrete module* over the Galois group, in the sense continuous cohomology
asks for; `EpsilonEridani.unitsCoeff_continuousSMul` is that consequence for a separable closure.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.stabilizer_isOpen_units`: the stabilizer of a unit of `L` is an open subgroup of
  `Gal(L/K)`.
