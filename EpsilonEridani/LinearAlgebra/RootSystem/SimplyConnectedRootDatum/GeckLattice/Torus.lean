# The split torus in the Geck carrier

The represented Geck lattice of a valid Dynkin type `t` gives a morphism from the split torus
of rank `t.rank` into the explicit Kostant toral-closure carrier
`EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.geckGroupScheme`. This file proves that the morphism is a closed immersion
whenever the Geck weights span the full character lattice.

The proof is deliberately conditional in the general case. The Geck weights generate exactly the
root lattice, which is usually a proper sublattice of the weight lattice used by the simply
connected root datum. Consequently the represented torus need not embed in the Geck carrier for
an arbitrary Dynkin type. The spanning condition is known for the three unimodular exceptional
types `E₈`, `F₄`, and `G₂`, where the root and weight lattices coincide, and this file records
the resulting closed immersions explicitly.

This supplies the intended closed split-torus component of a future pinning for those
three types. Proving that it is maximal, constructing a compatible Borel, identifying the carrier
as split reductive with the stated root datum, and constructing full-weight admissible lattices for
the remaining types are separate Layer 9 steps in the ReductiveGroups roadmap. The resulting
completed carriers are consumed by milestone L0 of the CFSGStatement roadmap.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.isClosedImmersion_geckWeightTorus_of_span_eq_top`: the Geck weight torus is
  a closed immersion under the exact character-spanning hypothesis.
* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.geckWeightTorusClosedSubgroup`: the corresponding closed subgroup scheme of
  the Geck carrier.
* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.isClosedImmersion_geckWeightTorus_E8`, and the analogous `F4` and `G2`
  instances: the spanning hypothesis holds for the three unimodular exceptional types.
