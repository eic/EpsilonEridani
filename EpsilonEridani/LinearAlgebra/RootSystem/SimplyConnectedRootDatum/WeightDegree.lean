# The height degree of pinned integral weights

The pinned rational root system of a valid Dynkin type has the simple roots as a basis of its
weight space. Summing the coordinates in this basis gives a rational-valued degree on integral
weights. This file packages that functional as `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.weightDegree` and identifies
its value on the weights of Geck's defining representation.

On the coordinate indexed by a root `alpha`, `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.geckWeight` is the vector of
Cartan pairings of `alpha` against the numbered simple coroots. In the pinned fundamental-weight
coordinates this is the root itself. Its degree is therefore the height of `alpha`; in particular,
it is positive on every positive root and sends each simple-root Cartan row to one. These are the
facts needed to order a finite weight basis so that positive root subgroups act by upper
unitriangular matrices, the triangular input to the Borel component of a pinning.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.weightDegree`: the simple-root height functional on integral weights.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.weightDegree_geckWeight_inr`: the degree of a root coordinate is its root
  height.
* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.weightDegree_geckWeight_inr_pos`: positive-root coordinates have positive
  degree.
* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.weightDegree_cartanMatrix_row`: every simple-root Cartan row has degree one.
