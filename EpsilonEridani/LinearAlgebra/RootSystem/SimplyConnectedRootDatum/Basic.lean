# Scaffolding shared by the pinned simply connected root data

Layer 6 of the root-systems roadmap pins one integral root datum per valid Dynkin type, each on the
lattices `Fin n → ℤ` with the dot product as pairing, and each carrying a base whose support is the
image of an injective *simple index* map `e` naming the simple roots in Bourbaki order. This file
holds the part of that construction which carries no information about the type: only the per-type
files, such as `EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.SimplyConnectedRootDatum.A` and
`...SimplyConnectedRootDatum.D.Basic`, supply the mathematics of their own root system.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.simpleSupport`: the support of a pinned base, the image of a simple index map.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.hasCartanType_of_pairing_eq`: a base supported on a simple index map has Cartan type `t`
  as soon as the pairings of the simple roots are the entries of the standard Cartan matrix of `t`.
* `EpsilonEridani.corootSpan_eq_top_of_coroot_eq_single`: the coroots span the cocharacter lattice as soon
  as the simple coroots are the standard basis. This is the simply connected lattice condition.
* `EpsilonEridani.sum_smul_mem_or_neg_mem_closure`: a combination of a family with coefficients of one
  sign lies in the additive closure of the family, or its negative does. This is the shape in which
  the two membership axioms of `RootPairing.Base` are met.
* `EpsilonEridani.sub_mem_closure_of_le`: a difference of two members of a family telescopes into the
  additive closure of the consecutive differences. This is the shape in which those same axioms are
  met by the pinned data written in a coordinate potential.

Every pinned datum of Layer 6 pairs its two lattices by the dot product, which is a perfect pairing
by `EpsilonEridani.dotProductBilin_isPerfPair` in `EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Dual.lean`. The symmetry
and reflection preservation of the quadratic form carried by the Cartan matrix are supplied by
`EpsilonEridani.vecMul_dotProduct_comm` and `EpsilonEridani.reflect_vecMul_dotProduct_self` in
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Gram.lean`.
