# The tripled minuscule weight table of type D4

The three eight-dimensional representations of type `D₄`, the natural representation `V(ϖ₁)` and
the two half-spin representations `V(ϖ₃)` and `V(ϖ₄)`, are minuscule: every pairing of one of
their weights with a simple coroot is `-1`, `0` or `1`. This file enumerates their twenty-four
weights in the fundamental-weight basis `Fin 4 → ℤ`, eight per summand, beginning each block at
its fundamental weight, and records the structure a Chevalley carrier built on this weight family
needs.

The table is closed under the four Bourbaki-numbered simple reflections through explicit
permutations of `Fin 24`, with the reflection equation `s_i μ = μ - ⟨μ, αᵢ∨⟩ αᵢ`. Its weights
generate the full character lattice of `D₄`: the three blocks represent the three nonzero cosets
of the root lattice in the weight lattice, and their weights together generate the whole of it.
What makes all three blocks necessary is not that generation but stability under triality, which
cycles the blocks, so that no one block and no pair of blocks is stable.

Triality, the order-three symmetry `EpsilonEridani.trialityPermD4` of the `D₄` diagram, fixes the central
node and cycles the three outer nodes, so it cycles the three fundamental weights `ϖ₁`, `ϖ₃`, `ϖ₄`
and with them the three summands. The table is stable under it: `d4TripledTrialityPerm` is the
permutation of `Fin 24` carrying each weight `μ` to `μ ∘ σ⁻¹`, which is the equivariance
`wt (π a) (σ k) = wt a k` under which a numbered permutation of the coordinates of a Kostant
toral-closure carrier extends to an automorphism of the carrier. Its action on this table has order
three.

No representation or group scheme is constructed here. This is the weight-diagram input for the
tripled type-`D₄` Chevalley carrier, the carrier on which triality acts.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.d4TripledWeight`: the twenty-four weights in fundamental coordinates.
* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.d4TripledReflection`: the permutation induced by a simple reflection, with
  `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.d4TripledWeight_reflection` the simple-reflection equation.
* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.span_range_d4TripledWeight_eq_top`: the weights span the character lattice.
* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.d4TripledTrialityPerm`: the permutation of the table realizing triality,
  with `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.d4TripledWeight_d4TripledTrialityPerm_apply` its equivariance and
  `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.d4TripledTrialityPerm_pow_three` its order relation, whose pointwise forms
  for the permutation and its inverse are
  `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.d4TripledTrialityPerm_apply_apply_apply` and
  `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.d4TripledTrialityPerm_symm_apply_symm_apply_symm_apply`.

## References

The node numbering and the identification of the three minuscule weights follow Bourbaki, *Lie
Groups and Lie Algebras, Chapters 4--6*, Plate IV. The minuscule-orbit description of the
representations follows J. E. Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory*,
§13.4. That triality permutes the three eight-dimensional representations, and the conventions
for `³D₄(q)` that make this relevant, are R. W. Carter, *Simple Groups of Lie Type*, §12.2.
The formal organization follows the type-`E₆` minuscule orbit in
`EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.SimplyConnectedRootDatum.E6.MinusculeWeight`.

/-! ## The weight table -/

/-- **The twenty-four weights of the type-`D₄` representation `V(ϖ₁) ⊕ V(ϖ₃) ⊕ V(ϖ₄)`.**

Coordinates are pairings with the four Bourbaki-numbered simple coroots. Indices `0` to `7` carry
the weights of the natural representation, beginning at `ϖ₁ = (1, 0, 0, 0)`; indices `8` to `15`
those of the half-spin representation `V(ϖ₃)`, beginning at `ϖ₃`; and indices `16` to `23` those
of `V(ϖ₄)`, beginning at `ϖ₄`. Within each block every weight after the first is a simple
reflection of an earlier weight of the block; no mathematical structure depends on the ordering. -/
