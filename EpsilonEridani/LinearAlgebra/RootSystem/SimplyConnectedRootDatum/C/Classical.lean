# Classical coordinates on the pinned type `Cₙ` lattices

The pinned type `Cₙ` datum `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.typeCSimplyConnectedRootDatum` writes its character
lattice in the fundamental-weight basis and its cocharacter lattice in the simple-coroot basis.
Both lattices are also the classical lattice `ℤ ^ n` with standard basis `e₀, …, e_{n-1}`, because
the simple coroots `eᵢ - eᵢ₊₁` and `e_{n-1}` of `Cₙ` form a basis of it. This file makes that
identification explicit, in the form a concrete group with diagonal torus `𝔾ₘⁿ` consumes.

The change of coordinates on characters sends `λ` to its pairings `(⟨λ, e_a⟩)_a` with the
classical basis, and the one on cocharacters sends `μ` to `(⟨e_a, μ⟩)_a`. They send the families
`EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.TypeC.weight` and `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.TypeC.coweight` to the standard basis
vectors and carry the pinned dot-product pairing to the classical one. Both are integral with
integral inverse, since the matrices of the two families are inverse transposes of one another by
`EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.TypeC.weight_dotProduct_coweight`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.TypeC.classicalWeightEquiv`: classical coordinates on the character lattice.
* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.TypeC.classicalCoweightEquiv`: classical coordinates on the cocharacter
  lattice.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.TypeC.classicalWeightEquiv_weight` and
  `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.TypeC.classicalCoweightEquiv_coweight`: `e_a` has classical coordinates the
  `a`-th standard basis vector in both lattices, with inverses
  `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.TypeC.classicalWeightEquiv_symm_single` and
  `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.TypeC.classicalCoweightEquiv_symm_single`.
* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.TypeC.classicalWeightEquiv_dotProduct_classicalCoweightEquiv`: the change of
  coordinates preserves the pairing.
