# The sign character of a Weyl group

The Weyl group of a root pairing carries a canonical homomorphism to `ℤˣ` sending every reflection
to `-1`. This file builds it as `EpsilonEridani.weylSign`, from the parity of the inversion count: the
number of positive roots that an element sends to negative roots, taken modulo two.

Two facts make the construction work, and both are already available at the root level. A word in
the simple reflections spells an element whose inversion count has the parity of the word length
(`EpsilonEridani.ncard_inversions_wordProd_modEq_length`), and every element is spelled by such a word
(`EpsilonEridani.exists_wordProd_eq_and_length_eq_ncard_inversions`). Concatenating words therefore adds
inversion counts modulo two, which is exactly multiplicativity of `(-1) ^ (inversion count)`. No
Coxeter presentation is used: everything is stated in terms of `EpsilonEridani.inversions` and
`EpsilonEridani.wordProd`.

Although the definition names a base, the resulting character does not depend on it. Every root is
Weyl-conjugate to a simple root (`EpsilonEridani.exists_mem_support_weylGroupToPerm_eq`), and `ℤˣ` is
commutative, so the reflection in *any* root — simple or not — has sign `-1`. Since the reflections
generate the Weyl group, a homomorphism to `ℤˣ` killing no reflection is unique, and two bases give
the same character.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.weylSign`: the sign character `P.weylGroup →* ℤˣ` of a base, `w ↦ (-1) ^ ℓ(w)` with
  `ℓ(w)` the number of inversions.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ncard_inversions_mul_modEq`: the inversion count is additive modulo two, the fact that
  makes `EpsilonEridani.weylSign` a homomorphism.
* `EpsilonEridani.weylSign_ofIdx`: **every reflection has sign `-1`**, not only the simple ones.
* `EpsilonEridani.weylSign_wordProd`: a word of `n` letters spells an element of sign `(-1) ^ n`.
* `EpsilonEridani.weylSign_eq_one_iff` and `EpsilonEridani.weylSign_eq_neg_one_iff`: the sign reads off the
  parity of the inversion count.
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_weylSign_of_forall_ofIdx`: **the sign character is the unique homomorphism to `ℤˣ`
  sending every reflection to `-1`**, whence `EpsilonEridani.weylSign_eq_weylSign`: **it does not depend
  on the base**.
* `EpsilonEridani.weylSign_longestElement`: the longest element has sign `(-1) ^ |Φ⁺|`.

## Implementation notes

The target is `ℤˣ` rather than a two-element type of one's own, matching Mathlib's
`Equiv.Perm.sign` and the `(-1 : ℤˣ) ^ _` spelling that the Weyl numerator of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md` asks for.

`EpsilonEridani.weylSign_apply` is deliberately not a `simp` lemma. Unfolding the character back to a
power of `-1` would take every lemma below out of simp-normal form, `EpsilonEridani.weylSign_ofIdx` first
among them; the computations are meant to be done through the named lemmas, not by re-exposing the
inversion count.

The base-independence statement is an equality of homomorphisms rather than a definition of a
base-free `weylSign P`, because a base is what the inversion count is measured against: there is no
canonical choice to build the definition on, only the theorem that the choice does not matter.

## References

The sign character is the "`sgn(w)`" of the Weyl numerator
`∑_{w ∈ W} sgn(w) e^{w(λ+ρ) - ρ}` in Layer 6 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md` (the Weyl character formula, the
Weyl dimension formula and Kostant's multiplicity formula are all stated with it), and of the
Tits-sign criterion in the same layer. Its well-definedness is the length-parity statement
`EpsilonEridani.length_modEq_length_of_wordProd_eq` recorded in Layer 1 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/RootSystems/README.md`, whose docstring names this character
as its purpose; this file is that prerequisite, built where the inversion combinatorics lives.

The convention follows Bourbaki, *Lie Groups and Lie Algebras*, Chapters 4--6, Ch. VI §1, and

/-! ### The inversion count modulo two -/

/-- **The inversion count is additive modulo two.** Spell each factor by a word of exactly as many
letters as it has inversions and concatenate: the product is spelled by a word whose length is the
sum of the two lengths, and a word spells an element whose inversion count has the parity of the
word length.

Additivity itself fails — `EpsilonEridani.ncard_inversions_mul_le` is only an inequality — so the parity
is the sharpest statement available, and it is exactly what a sign character needs. -/

/-- **The sign character does not depend on the base.** Both characters send every reflection to
`-1`, and that pins a homomorphism to `ℤˣ` uniquely. So the sign is an invariant of the Weyl group
of the root pairing, even though the inversion count defining it is not. -/
