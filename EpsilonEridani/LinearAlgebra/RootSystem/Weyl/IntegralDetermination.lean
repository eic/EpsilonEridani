# An alternating element below a weight is determined by its dominant integral coefficients

An element of the integral group algebra `ℤ[M]` of the weight space of a root system is
*alternating* for the dot action (`EpsilonEridani.IsDotAlternating`) when its coefficients transform by
the sign character. Such an element is determined by its coefficients on a fundamental domain of
the dot action, and `EpsilonEridani.IsDotAlternating.eq_of_coeff_openDotDominantChamber_eq` says so with
the fundamental domain taken to be the open dominant chamber of the dot action. That statement
needs a `[LinearOrder R]` on the coefficient ring compatible with its ring structure
(`[IsStrictOrderedRing R]`), because a chamber is cut out by inequalities.

This file proves the same determination without any order on `R`, for an alternating element whose
support is **integral** — every simple coroot takes an integer value on it — and lies **below** a
fixed weight `lam`, in the sense that `lam - x` is a nonnegative integer combination of the simple
roots. The fundamental domain is then described arithmetically rather than by inequalities: a
weight `x` is taken to be *dominant integral* when every simple coroot takes a **natural** value
on it. Since `⟨ρ, αᵢ^∨⟩ = 1`, that is exactly the condition `⟨x + ρ, αᵢ^∨⟩ > 0` cutting out the
open dominant chamber of the dot action, read off arithmetically.

Both hypotheses are met by the object the Weyl character formula is about: for a finite-dimensional
highest weight module of weight `lam`, the product of the formal character with the Weyl
denominator is alternating and supported in `lam - Q⁺`, while the coefficient ring there is an
algebraically closed field, which carries no linear order making it a strictly ordered ring, so
that the chamber statement does not apply to it.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsDotAlternating.eq_zero_of_forall_coeff_dominantIntegral_eq_zero`: **an alternating
  element below `lam` whose dominant integral coefficients all vanish is zero.**
* `EpsilonEridani.IsDotAlternating.eq_of_forall_coeff_dominantIntegral_eq`: **two alternating elements
  below `lam` agreeing at every dominant integral weight are equal.**

## The argument

Suppose `f.coeff x ≠ 0` and `x` is not dominant integral, so that some simple coroot takes a
negative integer value `z` on `x`.

* If `z = -1` then `x` lies on the wall of the simple reflection `sᵢ` for the dot action, and an
  alternating element vanishes there
  (`EpsilonEridani.IsDotAlternating.coeff_eq_zero_of_coroot'_eq_neg_one`).
* Otherwise `z ≤ -2` and the dot reflection `sᵢ ⬝ x = x - (z + 1) αᵢ` *raises* `x` by the positive
  multiple `-(z+1)` of `αᵢ`. Its coefficient is `-f.coeff x`, again nonzero, so it too lies below
  `lam`, and the height of `lam - sᵢ ⬝ x` is smaller by `-(z+1) ≥ 1`.

Induction on that height — a natural number, because `lam - x` lies in the positive root cone
(`EpsilonEridani.exists_natCast_eq_heightLinearMap_of_mem_posRootCone`) — therefore reaches a dominant
integral weight, where the hypothesis applies. No Weyl-group orbit and no finiteness of the Weyl
group enters: the raising is by a single simple reflection at a time.

This supplies the order-free replacement, named as missing in
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/HighestWeight/Character.lean`, for the chamber step of the Weyl character
formula of Layer 6 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md`.

The raising induction is the one of `EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/DominantCone.lean`, run for
the dot action instead of the linear one.

/-- **An alternating element below `lam` whose dominant integral coefficients all vanish is zero.**

The support is assumed to lie in `lam - Q⁺` and to be integral on the simple coroots; the
conclusion is that a coefficient at a weight with a negative simple coroot value is forced to
vanish as well, either because the weight lies on a wall of the dot action or because the dot
reflection carries it to a weight strictly closer to `lam`. -/
