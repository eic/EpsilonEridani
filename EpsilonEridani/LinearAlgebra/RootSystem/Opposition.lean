# The opposition involution of a base

The longest element `w₀` of a finite Weyl group exchanges the positive and the negative roots, so
`α ↦ -w₀ α` permutes the positive roots. This file proves that it permutes the **simple** roots: it
is an involution of the base, the **opposition involution** `EpsilonEridani.opposition`.

The proof is the classical one. A simple root is exactly a positive root that is not the sum of two
positive roots — that is `EpsilonEridani.mem_support_iff_isPos_and_forall_ne_add`, proved in
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/Positive.lean` — and `α ↦ -w₀ α` is an additive bijection of the
positive roots, so it preserves that description.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.opposition` is the opposition involution `i ↦ -w₀ i` on root indices.
* `EpsilonEridani.oppositionPerm` is the permutation of the base that it induces.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.root_opposition`, `EpsilonEridani.coroot'_opposition` and `EpsilonEridani.opposition_involutive`: the
  opposition map is an involution of the root indices realising `α ↦ -w₀ α` on roots, and negating
  the longest-element translate on the coroot functionals.
* `EpsilonEridani.opposition_mem_support`: **the opposition involution permutes the simple roots.**
* `EpsilonEridani.neg_smul_mem_posRootCone_longestElement`: **`-w₀` preserves the positive root cone**, the
  consequence of that permutation for nonnegative combinations of the simple roots;
  `EpsilonEridani.neg_smul_mem_posRootCone_longestElement_iff` is the resulting `simp` normalisation, `-w₀`
  being an involution.

## Implementation notes

`EpsilonEridani.opposition` is defined on all of `ι`, not on the subtype `↥b.support`, so that it composes
with the permutation action of the Weyl group without coercions; `EpsilonEridani.oppositionPerm` is its
restriction to the base. The definition spells root negation as `P.reflectionPerm i i` rather than
through Mathlib's `RootPairing.indexNeg`, since the latter is not a global instance and would have
to be introduced by a `let` at every use site. `EpsilonEridani.oppositionPerm` is the
`Equiv.Perm.subtypePerm` of the ambient `Function.Involutive.toPerm`; its membership hypothesis is
rewritten along `Function.Involutive.coe_toPerm` instead of being supplied directly, because
`EpsilonEridani.opposition` is not `@[expose]` and the term is then not type-correct at reducible
transparency, which blocks `rw` and `simp` on `EpsilonEridani.coe_oppositionPerm`.

## References

This file belongs to the "longest element" item, last in Layer 4 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/RootSystems/README.md` — the stage implemented by its sole
import `EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/LongestElement.lean`. That item pins `w₀` by
`w₀ • posRoots b = negRoots b` and `w₀ ^ 2 = 1`, which say exactly that `-w₀` is an involutive
permutation of the positive roots; proved here is *which* permutation it is, namely one that
restricts to the base. Every stage the argument stands on is on `main`: the positivity and height
API of Layer 1 (`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/Positive.lean`, where the indecomposability
characterisation it consumes lives), and the chamber, fundamental-domain and longest-element
results of Layer 4.

Restricting `-w₀` to the base is what lets a condition imposed on the values of the *simple* coroot
functionals be transported along it. Its companion `LongestElement.lean` already transports one
such condition: `EpsilonEridani.neg_smul_mem_dominantChamber_longestElement` says `-(w₀ • x)` is dominant
whenever `x` is, and that argument needs only that `-w₀` carries positive roots to positive roots.
Integrality is the condition that needs the restriction to the base itself.
`EpsilonEridani.IsDominantIntegral` in `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Lie/HighestWeight/Basic.lean` is such a condition
— `∀ i ∈ b.support, ∃ n : ℕ, lam (coroot i) = (n : K)` — and transporting it along `-w₀` asks for
the natural value of `lam` at the *simple* index `opposition i`, so it needs exactly
`EpsilonEridani.opposition_mem_support` and `EpsilonEridani.coroot'_opposition`. That transport is one conjunct
of `exists_invariantForm_iff_neg_longest_smul_eq` in
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/Suggested.lean`; the conjunct mentions no Lie
algebra and no Verma module, and nothing here depends on the enveloping-algebra layers on which the
rest of that target rests. The argument is the one in J. E. Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie
Algebras and Representation Theory*, GTM 9, Ch. III, §10.3 and §13.1, and in N. Bourbaki, *Groupes
et algèbres de Lie*, Ch. VI, §1.6.
