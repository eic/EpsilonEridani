# Duality of Dynkin types

Interchanging the roots and the coroots of a root pairing (`RootPairing.flip`) transposes every
pairing `⟨αᵢ, αⱼ^∨⟩`, hence transposes the Cartan matrix of a base
(`RootPairing.Base.cartanMatrix_flip`, proved in `EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.Flip`).
On the classification side that operation permutes the Dynkin types, and this file pins the
permutation: `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.dual` exchanges `Bₙ` with `Cₙ` and fixes every other type.
Duality is what makes the orientation carried by `EpsilonEridani.HasCartanType` meaningful, since `Bₙ` and
`Cₙ` are exactly the pair of types that the orientation separates.

The dual type is not read off the transposed matrix on the nose. Transposing a Cartan matrix does
not merely relabel the diagram, it reverses every arrow, and for `F₄` and `G₂` the reversed diagram
is the original one read backwards. So duality carries a relabelling of the nodes as well as a
change of type, and `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.dualNodeEquiv` is that relabelling: the identity for the
classical families and the `E` types, and the reversal `Fin.revPerm` for `F₄` and `G₂`.

`EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.Valid` is deliberately *not* preserved by duality, and the failure is exactly
the low-rank coincidence `B 2 = C 2`: `B 2` is valid and its dual `C 2` is not, because the two
name the same root system and the enumeration keeps only one of the names. Away from that pair
validity does transfer (`EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.valid_dual_iff`). The last section shows that nothing
is lost there: at rank at most two a base has a Cartan type exactly when it has the dual type
(`EpsilonEridani.hasCartanType_dual_iff_of_rank_le_two`), because transposing a matrix with constant
diagonal and at most two indices is itself a simultaneous relabelling.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.dual`: the dual Dynkin type, exchanging `Bₙ` and `Cₙ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.dualNodeEquiv`: the relabelling of nodes that duality carries.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.cartanMatrix_dual`: the standard Cartan matrix of the dual type is the
  transpose of the standard Cartan matrix, read through `dualNodeEquiv`.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasCartanType_flip_iff`: **the Cartan type of a base and the Cartan type of the flipped
  base are dual**. In particular a base is of type `Bₙ` exactly when the flipped base is of type
  `Cₙ` (`EpsilonEridani.hasCartanType_flip_C_iff`, and `EpsilonEridani.hasCartanType_flip_B_iff` for the other
  orientation).
* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.valid_dual_iff`: validity transfers along duality except for the pair
  `B 2`, `C 2`.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasCartanType_dual_iff_of_rank_le_two`: at rank at most two a type and its dual match
  the same bases, which is why dropping `C 2` from the valid types loses nothing.

This file supplies the duality half of the `DynkinType` layer of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/RootSystems/README.md`: Layer 5 records that
`DynkinType.cartanMatrix (.B n)` is the transpose of `DynkinType.cartanMatrix (.C n)` and that the
two types are "identified only after `flip` (duality)", and Layer 6 asks for the adjoint root datum
to be `RootPairing.flip` of the dual type's datum. See Bourbaki, *Lie Groups and Lie Algebras,
Chapters 4-6*, plates I-IX, for the standard Cartan matrices and their duals.

/-- **The dual Dynkin type.** Duality reverses the arrows of a diagram, which exchanges the types
`Bₙ` and `Cₙ` — the one pair whose standard Cartan matrices are transposes of one another without
being equal — and fixes all the others. It is realized on root systems by `RootPairing.flip`; see
`EpsilonEridani.hasCartanType_flip_iff`.

This is `@[expose]`d because it occurs in the *type* of `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.dualNodeEquiv` below,
whose constructor equations do not even elaborate unless `(.A n).dual.rank` reduces to `n`. -/

low-rank coincidence `B 2 = C 2`: both names describe the same root system, and the enumeration
keeps only `B 2` valid. So both orientations of that pair genuinely fail — `B 2` is valid while its
dual `C 2` is not, and `C 2` is not valid while its dual `B 2` is (`simp` proves either from
`EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.valid_B`, `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.valid_C` and `dual_B`, `dual_C`). No base is lost
by keeping only the first name; see `EpsilonEridani.hasCartanType_dual_iff_of_rank_le_two`. -/

are self-dual without being simply laced — the reversed diagram is the original one read backwards,
