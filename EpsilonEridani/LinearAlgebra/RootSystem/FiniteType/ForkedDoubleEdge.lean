# The affine diagrams `B̃ₗ` and `A⁽²⁾₂ₗ₋₁` are not of finite type

A connected finite-type diagram is a tree of maximal degree three, and the constraints of the
Cartan-Killing classification that remain concern where a branch vertex and a multiple edge may
sit. The fork bound
(`EpsilonEridani.eq_zero_or_eq_one_one_or_eq_one_two_le_four_of_isFiniteType_star_three`) settles the
simply-laced branchings; the rank-two estimates of
`EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.FiniteType.Basic` settle a multiple edge locally; and
`EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_mul_apply_eq_one_of_three_le_card` already excludes a multiple edge
*incident to* a branch vertex, since a vertex of degree three meets each of its neighbours along a
single edge. What none of them reaches is a double edge at a positive distance from a branch
vertex, and the list `Aₙ, Bₙ, Cₙ, Dₙ, E₆, E₇, E₈, F₄, G₂` has no such member. This file supplies
that step.

The obstruction is the extended Dynkin diagram `B̃ₗ`, which is exactly the diagram of `Bₗ` with one
further vertex joined to the second vertex of its chain: a fork at one end, a chain, and the double
edge of `Bₗ` at the other end. Adjoining a pendant vertex is the general operation
`EpsilonEridani.adjoinPendant`, and `EpsilonEridani.affineBCartanMatrix n` is `Bₙ₊₃` with a pendant vertex
adjoined at the index `1`, so that the number of vertices separating the fork from the double edge
is arbitrary. An acyclic diagram whose only multiple edge is a double edge, and which has a branch
vertex, carries one of these or one of their transposes: keep the path joining the branch vertex to
the double edge, two further neighbours of the branch vertex, and nothing else. Carrying that
extraction out is left to the step that assembles the classification; what this file provides is
the exclusion it needs, in the form `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.submatrix` consumes.

The certificate is the vector of **comarks** `EpsilonEridani.affineBComark`: the value `1` at the two
vertices of the fork and at the short vertex beyond the double edge, and `2` at every vertex in
between. The Cartan matrix annihilates them, so they are a nonzero subdominant vector and
`EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.eq_zero_of_forall_mul_sum_apply_mul_nonpos` excludes the diagram. The
transposed family, `Cₙ₊₃` with the same pendant vertex adjoined, is the twisted affine diagram
`A⁽²⁾₂ₗ₋₁`, and it is excluded through `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.transpose`. The rows of the chain are
evaluated with `EpsilonEridani.sum_range_chainBEntry_mul`. Its simply-laced specialization is
`EpsilonEridani.sum_range_chainEntry_mul`, used by
`EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.FiniteType.Star.Basic`.

The exclusion is sharp in the only direction available to it: deleting the pendant vertex leaves
`CartanMatrix.B (n + 3)`, which `EpsilonEridani.isFiniteType_cartanMatrix_B` proves to be of finite type,
so it is the fork, and not the double edge, that these diagrams die of.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.affineBCartanMatrix`: the Cartan matrix of the extended Dynkin diagram `B̃ₗ`, for
  `ℓ = n + 3`.
* `EpsilonEridani.affineBComark`: its comarks, the test vector the exclusion is proved with.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.sum_affineBCartanMatrix_mul_affineBComark_eq_zero`: the comarks are a null vector of the
  Cartan matrix.
* `EpsilonEridani.not_isFiniteType_affineBCartanMatrix` and
  `EpsilonEridani.not_isFiniteType_affineBCartanMatrix_transpose`: `affineBCartanMatrix n` and its
  transpose, the affine diagrams `B̃ₗ` and `A⁽²⁾₂ₗ₋₁`, are not of finite type.

## References

This file continues the "chain/fork length constraints" step of the classification of finite-type
Cartan matrices, Layer 5 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/RootSystems/README.md`. The
diagram is the affine type `B⁽¹⁾ₗ` of V. G. Kac, *Infinite Dimensional Lie Algebras*, 3rd ed.,
Ch. 4 and Table Aff 1. Kac writes `aᵢⱼ = ⟨αⱼ, αᵢ^∨⟩`, the transpose of the convention
`cartanMatrix i j = ⟨αᵢ, αⱼ^∨⟩` used here, so the null vector below is his vector of comarks. See
also J. E. Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory*, §11.4, where the
same configuration is excluded.

/-! ### The affine diagram `B̃ₗ` -/

/-- **The Cartan matrix of the extended Dynkin diagram `B̃ₗ`**, for `ℓ = n + 3`: the chain of `Bₗ`,
whose last edge is double, with one further vertex joined to its second vertex. That second vertex
is then joined to three others, and the double edge stands at the far end of the chain, at an
arbitrary distance from it - at `n = 0` the branch vertex carries the double edge itself. -/

/-- The **comarks** of `B̃ₗ`: the value `1` at the two vertices of the fork and at the short vertex
beyond the double edge, and `2` at every vertex of the chain in between.

Along the chain these are the coefficients of the highest root of `Bₗ` in the basis of simple
coroots, `θ^∨ = α₁^∨ + 2 α₂^∨ + ⋯ + 2 α_{ℓ-1}^∨ + α_ℓ^∨`, and the pendant vertex carries `1`: they
are the comarks of the affine type `B⁽¹⁾ₗ`, which is what a null vector of the Cartan matrix is in
the convention `cartanMatrix i j = ⟨αᵢ, αⱼ^∨⟩` used here. -/

nonzero subdominant vector, indeed a null vector, so
`EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.eq_zero_of_forall_mul_sum_apply_mul_nonpos` excludes it.

For `n ≥ 1` no earlier elimination reaches it: it is a genuine generalized Cartan matrix, its
branch vertex has degree three, its one double edge is the only multiple edge and has Cartan
product `2`, which the rank-two estimates allow, and the fork bound applies to simply-laced stars
only. At `n = 0` the branch vertex carries the double edge itself, and
`EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_mul_apply_eq_one_of_three_le_card` - a branch vertex is simply laced -
already excludes that member. -/

`B̃ₗ` reverses every edge, so it fixes the pendant edge and the chain and turns the double edge of
`Bₗ` into that of `Cₗ`, giving the twisted affine diagram `A⁽²⁾₂ₗ₋₁`. The two orientations are the
two ways a double edge can face a branch vertex, so together with
`EpsilonEridani.not_isFiniteType_affineBCartanMatrix` this rules out both. -/
