# The branchless double-edge case of the finite-type classification

A connected finite-type Cartan diagram of maximum degree two is a path. If one edge of that path is
double, `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.exists_equiv_forall_eq_doubleEdgeCartanMatrix` reindexes the diagram
onto `EpsilonEridani.doubleEdgeCartanMatrix p q`, and the double-edge bound
`EpsilonEridani.eq_one_or_eq_one_or_eq_two_two_of_isFiniteType_doubleEdge` leaves precisely the families
`B_n`, `C_n`, and the exceptional type `F_4`.

The double edge is taken here in the orientation-free form `A u v * A v u = 2`, which is what the
sign conditions of a finite-type matrix produce at a multiple edge. Its two orientations reindex to
the two transposed models, and the alternatives below are stated so as to cover both.

Excluding a branch vertex from a connected finite-type diagram containing a double edge remains the
final extraction step before this result applies to the unrestricted double-edge branch.

## Main results

* `IsFiniteType.exists_equiv_forall_eq_doubleEdgeCartanMatrix_eq_one_or_eq_one_or_eq_two_two`
  (in the `EpsilonEridani` namespace, the full name being too long for one line): a preconnected
  finite-type diagram of maximum degree two containing a double edge is a double-edge model whose
  two nonempty arms have one of the `B`, `C`, and `F_4` shapes.

Layer 5 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/RootSystems/README.md`. The exclusion of two
multiple edges is the affine-diagram argument in N. Bourbaki, *Lie Groups and Lie Algebras,

/-- **The branchless double-edge case is a double-edge model of one of the admissible shapes.** A
preconnected finite-type diagram of maximum degree two in which the edge `u -- v` is double
reindexes to two nonempty chains joined by that edge, and those chains have one of the three shapes
in the Cartan--Killing list: the second is a singleton (type `C`), the first is a singleton (type
`B`), or both have two vertices (type `F_4`).

The double edge is given by the orientation-free hypothesis `A u v * A v u = 2`; the two
orientations of the edge give the two transposed models, both of which the disjunction covers. -/
-- `degree` needs finite neighbour sets while the theorem type is elaborated, so this decidability
