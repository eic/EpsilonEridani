# The double-edge bound for finite-type Cartan matrices

In a finite-type diagram an index carrying a multiple edge is joined to every *other* index by at
most a single edge (`EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_mul_apply_le_one_of_two_le`) - a restriction on what
is incident to one endpoint of the edge, not yet a count of the multiple edges of a whole diagram -
and a triple edge is isolated outright
(`EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_eq_zero_of_apply_mul_apply_eq_three`), which leaves `G₂`. A double
edge is not isolated. Once the component carrying one has been shown to have no branch vertex - a
step taken outside this file, as noted below - it is two chains, of `p` and of `q` vertices, joined
at their last vertices by that edge, and that is the shape this file takes as given. Which of those
survive is the *chain* half of the "chain/fork length constraints" of the Cartan--Killing
classification, and, like the fork half in
`EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.FiniteType.Star.Basic`, it is an arithmetic constraint:

`2 p q < (p + 1) (q + 1)`,

equivalently `(p - 1) (q - 1) < 2`, whose solutions with both chains nonempty are `q = 1` (the
chains `Cₙ`), `p = 1` (the chains `Bₙ`), and `p = q = 2` (`F₄`).

This file builds that diagram as a matrix, `EpsilonEridani.doubleEdgeCartanMatrix`, out of the chain
entries of `EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.Chain`, and proves the bound. The elimination tool is
the one the fork bound uses: a finite-type matrix admits no nonzero
**subdominant** vector, one whose every coordinate `xᵢ` has `xᵢ · (A x)ᵢ ≤ 0`
(`EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.eq_zero_of_forall_mul_sum_apply_mul_nonpos`). The certificate is the vector
of **marks** `EpsilonEridani.doubleEdgeMark`, which grows linearly along each of the two chains towards
the double edge, in steps of `q` on the side of `p` vertices and of `p + 1` on the other. Those two
slopes are chosen so that the marks are annihilated at every vertex of the diagram except the far
end of the second chain, where the row takes the value `(p + 1) (q + 1) - 2 p q`, which is `≤ 0`
exactly when the bound fails.

The critical diagram, where the marks are a genuine null vector, is the extended Dynkin diagram
`F̃₄ = T(3, 2)`; it is recorded as a corollary. The bound is sharp along the two families it leaves:
`EpsilonEridani.isFiniteType_doubleEdgeCartanMatrix_one_right` identifies the diagram at `q = 1` with
Mathlib's `CartanMatrix.C (p + 1)`, so it really is of finite type there, and the case `p = 1`
follows by transposition.

The orientation is fixed once: the entry from the last vertex of the second chain to the last
vertex of the first is `-2`, and the opposite entry is `-1`. The reversed diagram is the transpose
(`EpsilonEridani.doubleEdgeCartanMatrix_transpose`), which finite type is invariant under
(`EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.transpose`), and the bound is symmetric in `p` and `q`, so nothing is lost.

As with the fork bound, only the arithmetic constraint is proved here: the step that produces such
a subdiagram from a finite-type diagram carrying a double edge - which is where the absence of a
branch vertex is established - is outside this file.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.doubleEdgeCartanMatrix`: the Cartan matrix of two chains, of `p` and of `q` vertices,
  joined by a double edge at their last vertices.
* `EpsilonEridani.doubleEdgeMark`: the marks of that diagram, the test vector the bound is proved with.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.two_mul_mul_lt_succ_mul_succ_of_isFiniteType_doubleEdge` and
  `EpsilonEridani.not_isFiniteType_doubleEdgeCartanMatrix_of_succ_mul_succ_le`: **the double-edge bound**,
  `2 p q < (p + 1) (q + 1)`, and its contrapositive.
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_one_or_eq_one_or_eq_two_two_of_isFiniteType_doubleEdge`: **the admissible shapes**.
  A double-edge diagram of finite type with nonempty chains has `p = 1`, or `q = 1`, or
  `p = q = 2`: the families `Bₙ`, `Cₙ`, and `F₄`.
* `EpsilonEridani.not_isFiniteType_affineF₄`: the critical diagram is not of finite type.
* `EpsilonEridani.isFiniteType_doubleEdgeCartanMatrix_one_right` and
  `EpsilonEridani.isFiniteType_doubleEdgeCartanMatrix_one_left`: the two families the bound leaves are of
  finite type, so the bound is sharp and its hypothesis is not vacuous.

Two computations, one for each kind of vertex. A chain annihilates a weight that is linear in the
position away from its two ends, and the far end of the first chain is cancelled by the double
edge; only the far end of the second chain is left, and there the bound is read off.

weight `(w + 1) c` being `c w + c`; the near end contributes nothing because that weight vanishes
one step before the chain starts. -/

The bound excludes everything outside `Bₙ`, `Cₙ` and `F₄`. That the two families do occur is proved
here, by identifying the diagram at `q = 1` with Mathlib's `CartanMatrix.C`. The third shape,
`EpsilonEridani.doubleEdgeCartanMatrix 2 2`, is left alone: the reindexing that identifies it with the
canonical Cartan matrix of `F₄` belongs to the assembly step of the classification, outside this
file.

they occur along the diagram is Mathlib's canonical identification `finSumFinEquiv`. -/
