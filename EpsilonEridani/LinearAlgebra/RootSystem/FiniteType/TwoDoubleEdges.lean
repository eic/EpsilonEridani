# A chain of a finite-type diagram carries at most one multiple edge

In a finite-type diagram the multiple edges at a *single* index are already restricted: an index
carrying one is joined to every other index by at most a single edge
(`EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_mul_apply_le_one_of_two_le`), and a triple edge is isolated outright
(`EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_eq_zero_of_apply_mul_apply_eq_three`). Neither statement forbids two
double edges lying at a distance from one another, and that is what this file rules out along a
chain: if the first edge of a chain of `m + 3` vertices is double, the last one is single.

The diagram to exclude is a chain whose two extreme edges are double, and there are two of them,
because a Cartan matrix orients its multiple edges: writing the entry `-2` of a double edge as an
arrow, the two arrows either point away from each other towards the chain ends, or both the same way
along the chain. On `l + 1` vertices these are the diagrams of the affine Kac-Moody algebras
`D⁽²⁾ₗ₊₁` and `A⁽²⁾₂ₗ`, hence singular, so the certificate is in each case a genuine null vector:
`EpsilonEridani.twoDoubleEdgeMark`, which is `1` at the first vertex, `2` at every interior vertex, and,
at the last vertex, `1` when the arrows point outwards and `2` when they agree.

A Cartan matrix is read here as `A i j = ⟨αᵢ, αⱼ^∨⟩`, the transpose of Kac's convention, so it is
the *rows* that annihilate this vector, and what its entries list are the **dual labels** of those
two diagrams, `1, 2, …, 2, 1` and `1, 2, …, 2, 2` — equivalently the marks of the dual diagrams
`C⁽¹⁾ₗ` and `A⁽²⁾₂ₗ`, the latter renumbered backwards, which is what the name records.

Unlike the fork bound of `EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.FiniteType.Star` and the double-edge
bound of `EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.FiniteType.DoubleEdge`, which leave surviving shapes and
so end in an arithmetic inequality, no member of this family is of finite type, whatever the length
of the chain. That is what makes the conclusion available in the form the classification wants,
`EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_mul_apply_le_one_of_chain_of_two_le`: a statement about an arbitrary
finite-type matrix rather than about the model diagram. Its hypotheses are the data of a chain of
indices carrying a multiple edge at one end - distinct indices, non-consecutive ones not joined,
the interior edges, those joining the vertices `s` and `s + 1` for `0 < s < m + 1`, single, and the
first edge multiple - and its conclusion is that the last edge is then single. That is exactly what
a path in the diagram of the matrix supplies, and the extraction of such a path from a diagram
carrying two double edges is the step left outside this file.

Note that the ends of the chain need not be the ends of the diagram: the hypotheses say nothing
about indices outside the chain, since finite type passes to principal submatrices
(`EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.submatrix`).

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.twoDoubleEdgeCartanMatrix`: the Cartan matrix of a chain of `m + 3` vertices whose first
  and last edges are double, the boolean argument orienting the last one.
* `EpsilonEridani.twoDoubleEdgeMark`: the dual labels of that diagram, the null vector the exclusion is
  proved with.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.sum_twoDoubleEdgeCartanMatrix_mul_twoDoubleEdgeMark_eq_zero`: the marks are a null
  vector of the diagram.
* `EpsilonEridani.not_isFiniteType_twoDoubleEdgeCartanMatrix`: **no doubly ended chain is of finite
  type**, in either orientation and at every length.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_mul_apply_le_one_of_chain_of_two_le`: **at most one edge of a chain
  of a finite-type diagram is multiple**, the form the classification consumes.

/-- The **Cartan matrix of a doubly ended chain**: `m + 3` vertices in a row, joined by single
edges except for the first and the last edges, which are double.

The first double edge is oriented once and for all, the entry from the second vertex to the first
being `-2`. The boolean `b` orients the last one: the entry from the vertex `m + 1` to the vertex
`m + 2` is `-2` when `b` is `true`, so that the two double edges point away from each other towards
the chain ends, and the opposite entry is `-2` when `b` is `false`, so that they point the same way
along the chain. In the notation of Kac's tables, read through the transpose, the first diagram is
`D⁽²⁾ₘ₊₃` and the second is `A⁽²⁾₂ₘ₊₄`. -/

At the vertices of the chain these are the dual labels of the affine diagram the chain is, the
marks of its dual: `1, 2, …, 2, 1` for `D⁽²⁾ₘ₊₃`, when `b` is `true`, and `1, 2, …, 2, 2` for

/-- **At most one edge of a chain of a finite-type diagram is multiple.** Let `v 0, …, v (m + 2)`
be distinct indices of a finite-type matrix, non-consecutive ones not joined at all and the
interior edges of the chain - those joining `v s` to `v (s + 1)` for `0 < s < m + 1` - single. If
the first edge, the one joining `v 0` to `v 1`, is multiple, then the last one, joining `v (m + 1)`
to `v (m + 2)`, is single; nothing is assumed about that last edge beforehand.

Nothing is assumed about the indices outside the chain: finite type passes to principal
submatrices, so the chain may sit anywhere inside a larger diagram. The hypotheses are what a path
in the diagram of the matrix provides, the non-adjacency of non-consecutive vertices coming from
the diagram of a finite-type matrix being a forest
(`EpsilonEridani.isAcyclic_diagramGraph`). -/
