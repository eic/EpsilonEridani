# The three arms of a simply-laced finite-type diagram

A connected simply-laced finite-type diagram with a branch vertex becomes three paths when that
vertex is deleted.  The finite-type degree bound supplies degree at most three, while the affine
`D` obstruction in `EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.FiniteType.Star.UniqueBranch` says that the
chosen branch vertex is the only vertex of degree three.  The general tree decomposition from
`EpsilonEridani.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph.BranchComponents` then applies.

This is the extraction step connecting arbitrary simply-laced finite-type diagrams to the model
stars classified in `EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.FiniteType.Star.Classification`.  The next
step attaches each path to the deleted vertex, reindexes the matrix onto `starCartanMatrix`, and
applies `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.existsUnique_dynkinType_of_star`.

## Main result

* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.exists_three_path_components_of_isSimplyLaced`: deleting a branch vertex
  from a connected simply-laced finite-type diagram leaves three path components.

/-- **Deleting a branch vertex from a connected simply-laced finite-type diagram leaves three
paths.**

The equivalence indexes the components by `Fin 3`; the component at `i` is a path graph on its own
number of vertices.  These cardinalities are the three arm lengths in the subsequent reindexing
onto `EpsilonEridani.starCartanMatrix`. -/
