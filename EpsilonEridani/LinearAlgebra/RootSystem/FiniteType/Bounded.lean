# A finite-type Cartan inequality has finitely many natural solutions

Let `A` be an integer matrix of finite type, that is a generalized Cartan matrix carrying a
positive symmetrizer whose symmetrization is positive definite (`EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType`). This file
proves that for every integer vector `y` the system of inequalities

`∑ j, A i j * c j ≤ y i`  (for every index `i`)

has only finitely many solutions `c` in the **nonnegative** integers.

The system is the shape in which dominance bounds a weight from below. A weight `mu` lying under
`lam` is `lam - ∑ j, c j • αⱼ` for natural numbers `c j`, and its value on the simple coroot
`αᵢ^∨` is `lam (αᵢ^∨) - ∑ j, c j * ⟨αⱼ, αᵢ^∨⟩`; asking that value to be a natural number is exactly
the displayed inequality for the transposed Cartan matrix. Finiteness of the solution set is
therefore finiteness of the set of dominant weights under `lam`, which is how
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/DominantCone.lean` uses it.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.finite_setOf_forall_sum_mul_le`: **an inequality whose matrix has a positive
  symmetrizer has finitely many natural solutions.**

## The argument

Everything happens in the rational bilinear form `F u v = u ⬝ᵥ S *ᵥ v` of the symmetrization
`S i j = d i * A i j`, which is symmetric and positive definite. Positive definiteness makes `S`
invertible, so every linear functional on `B → ℚ` is `F (·) w` for some `w`; the two functionals
this file represents that way are `c ↦ ∑ i, d i * y i * c i` and, for each index `k`, the `k`-th
coordinate.

* Because the entries of `c` are nonnegative and the symmetrizer is positive, the inequalities sum
  to `F x x ≤ F x z`, where `x` is `c` viewed rationally and `z` represents the first functional.
  Cauchy-Schwarz for a positive semidefinite symmetric form
  (`LinearMap.BilinForm.apply_sq_le_of_symm`) turns that into `F x x ≤ F z z`: a bound on the
  length of `x` that does not depend on `c`.
* Cauchy-Schwarz applied a second time, against the vector representing the `k`-th coordinate,
  bounds each `c k` in terms of `F x x`. So the solutions lie in a product of finite intervals.

No compactness, completeness or eigenvalue theory enters; the two applications of Cauchy-Schwarz
replace them, which is what keeps the argument inside `ℚ`.

/-- **A positively symmetrized matrix inequality has finitely many natural solutions.** Let `d` be
a positive rational vector such that the matrix with entries `d i * A i j` is positive definite.
For any integer vector `y`, only finitely many vectors `c` of natural numbers satisfy
`∑ j, A i j * c j ≤ y i` at every index `i`.

Positive definiteness of the symmetrization of `A` is what makes the solution set bounded: the
inequalities force the length of `c` in the symmetrized form to stay below a bound read off from
`y` alone. -/
