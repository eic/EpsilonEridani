# A simply-laced finite-type diagram without a branch node is of type `Aₙ`

The classification of finite-type Cartan matrices eliminates every shape outside the Dynkin list
and is then left with the task of *naming* the shapes that survive: a diagram known to be a chain
of single edges has to be reindexed onto the standard Cartan matrix `DynkinType.cartanMatrix (.A n)`
before it can be said to have that Cartan type. This file performs that reindexing for the type
`Aₙ` branch, where the surviving shape is a connected simply-laced diagram whose vertices all have
at most two neighbours.

The reindexing is the identification of the diagram with a path graph: a connected finite-type
diagram is a tree (`EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.isTree_diagramGraph`), a finite tree of maximum degree two
is a path graph (`EpsilonEridani.IsTree.nonempty_iso_pathGraph_of_degree_le_two`), and a simply-laced
matrix is determined by its diagram, its entries being `2` on the diagonal, `-1` along the edges,
and `0` elsewhere. Those are exactly the entries of `CartanMatrix.A n` at consecutive and
non-consecutive indices, which is what `EpsilonEridani.chainEntry_eq_cartanMatrix_A` records.

Both hypotheses do work. Without simple lacing the surviving shapes are `Bₙ`, `Cₙ`, `F₄` and `G₂`,
whose diagrams are also paths, and without the degree bound they are `Dₙ` and `E₆`, `E₇`, `E₈`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.apply_eq_chainEntry_of_iso_pathGraph`: a simply-laced normalized matrix equals
  `chainEntry` along any diagram isomorphism to `pathGraph n`.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_equiv_forall_eq_cartanMatrix_A_of_isTree_of_isSimplyLaced_of_degree_le_two`:
  a simply-laced matrix with diagonal entries `2` and a tree diagram of maximum degree two is the
  standard Cartan matrix of type `Aₙ` after a relabelling of its index type.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.exists_equiv_forall_eq_cartanMatrix_A`: a connected simply-laced finite-type
  matrix whose diagram has maximum degree two is the standard Cartan matrix of type `Aₙ` after a
  relabelling of its index type.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasCartanType_A_of_isSimplyLaced_of_degree_le_two`: the same statement for the base of an
  irreducible root system, in the form `EpsilonEridani.HasCartanType`.
* `EpsilonEridani.existsUnique_dynkinType_of_isSimplyLaced_of_degree_le_two`: such a base has exactly one
  valid Dynkin type, which is the classification statement itself on these diagrams.
