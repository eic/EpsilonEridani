# Cartan matrices of finite type

The Cartan-Killing classification is, at bottom, a statement about integer matrices: the Cartan
matrix of a finite crystallographic root system is a generalized Cartan matrix that is
*symmetrizable with positive definite symmetrization*, and only finitely many combinatorial shapes
of such a matrix exist. This file introduces the matrix-level condition, `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType`,
develops the tools that eliminate diagrams from the list, and proves that the Cartan matrix of a
base of a finite crystallographic root system satisfies it.

Positive definiteness is asked for over `ℚ`, not over `ℤ`.
`EpsilonEridani.Matrix.posDef_map_intCast` shows that positive definiteness over `ℤ` implies positive
definiteness over `ℚ`, and the rational form is the one downstream arguments use, since a test
vector produced by a diagram computation need not have integer entries. The symmetrizer `d` is
likewise rational: it is the vector of inverse root lengths, which is integral only after clearing
denominators. The symmetrization itself is not redone here: Mathlib packages it over `ℤ` as
`RootPairing.Base.exists_cartanMatrix_diagaonal_mul_posDef`, resting on
`RootPairing.posRootForm_rootFormIn_posDef`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType`: an integer matrix is a generalized Cartan matrix admitting a positive
  rational symmetrizer whose symmetrization is positive definite.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isFiniteType_of`: a constructor that does not ask for the symmetric vanishing pattern,
  which the symmetrizer already forces.
* `EpsilonEridani.isFiniteType_of_posDef_map_intCast`: the constructor for a generalized Cartan matrix
  whose rational cast is itself positive definite, with the constant-one symmetrizer. The
  simply-laced Cartan matrices are of this kind.
* `EpsilonEridani.isFiniteType_of_conjTranspose_mul_self_of_det_ne_zero`: the constructor used for a
  matrix presented by its entries. Positive definiteness of the symmetrization is certified by an
  explicit Gram model `Cᴴ * C` together with nonsingularity, both of which are finite
  computations.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.submatrix`: principal submatrices of a finite-type matrix are of finite
  type. This is what lets a forbidden subdiagram rule out a diagram containing it.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.transpose`: finite type is invariant under matrix transposition.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.sum_apply_mul_apply_lt_four`: the star bound. The Cartan products joining
  an index to pairwise non-adjacent neighbours sum to less than `4`. This is the first of the two
  positive-definiteness estimates behind the local shape of a finite-type diagram.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_mul_apply_mem_of_ne`: the rank-two bound. For `i ≠ j` the Cartan
  product `A i j * A j i` lies in `{0, 1, 2, 3}`, so every edge of the diagram is single, double or
  triple.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.isSimplyLaced_iff`: **a finite-type matrix is simply laced exactly when
  none of its edges is multiple**, that is, when no Cartan product of two distinct indices exceeds
  `1`. Together with the rank-two bound this is how the classification enters its simply-laced
  branch, having excluded the Cartan products `2` and `3`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.exists_apply_succ_eq_zero`: **a finite-type diagram carries no cycle**. A
  cyclic list of at least three distinct indices has a missing edge. This is the second estimate:
  the test vector is supported on the indices of the putative cycle, its coordinate at each of them
  being the reciprocal of the symmetrizer, and each edge of the cycle then cancels the diagonal
  contribution of one of its ends.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_eq_zero_of_apply_ne_zero`: **a finite-type diagram carries no
  triangle**, the three-index case of the previous item: two distinct neighbours of an index are
  never adjacent to one another. `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.pairwise_apply_eq_zero` is the same statement
  for a whole neighbourhood, in the shape the star bound consumes.

The star bound selects its neighbours through a pairwise non-adjacency hypothesis; with the triangle
excluded that hypothesis comes for free, and the consequences below are the unconditional graph
statements the classification runs on.

* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.card_le_three_of_forall_apply_ne_zero`: **the degree bound**. No index has
  four neighbours; the affine type `D̃₄` is ruled out in `EpsilonEridani.not_isFiniteType_affineD₄`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_mul_apply_le_one_of_two_le`: **at most one edge at an index is
  multiple**.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_eq_zero_of_apply_mul_apply_eq_three`: **a triple edge is isolated**,
  so it is a connected component of the diagram; this is why `G₂` has rank `2`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_mul_apply_eq_one_of_three_le_card`: **a branch vertex is simply
  laced**. Three neighbours of an index are each joined to it by a single edge.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.det_ne_zero`: a finite-type matrix is nonsingular. Since the extended
  Dynkin diagrams have singular Cartan matrices, this is the third elimination tool; the affine
  type `Ã₂` is ruled out in `EpsilonEridani.not_isFiniteType_affineA₂`. It does not subsume the
  no-triangle theorem: `EpsilonEridani.not_isFiniteType_doubleEdgeTriangle` exhibits a nonsingular
  triangle.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.eq_zero_of_forall_mul_sum_apply_mul_nonpos`: **a finite-type matrix has no
  nonzero subdominant vector**, one with `xᵢ · (A x)ᵢ ≤ 0` at every index. This is the fourth
  elimination tool, and unlike `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.det_ne_zero` it does not ask the certificate to
  be a null vector, only to point away from the positive cone coordinatewise, so a single vector can
  rule out a whole family of diagrams.
* `EpsilonEridani.isFiniteType_cartanMatrix`: **the Cartan matrix of a base of a finite crystallographic
  root system is of finite type**, and `EpsilonEridani.HasCartanType.isFiniteType`: so is the standard
  Cartan matrix of any Dynkin type realized by such a base.

`i` outside a pairwise non-adjacent `s`, any vector taking the value `1` at `i`, the value
`-dᵢAᵢₖ / 2dₖ` at each `k ∈ s` and `0` at every other index evaluates the form at
`2dᵢ - (dᵢ/2) ∑ⱼ AᵢⱼAⱼᵢ`. When the symmetrizer is positive, as it is at the one call site below,
that value at `k ∈ s` is the one minimizing the `k`-th coordinate of the form — a legitimate choice
one coordinate at a time because `s` is pairwise non-adjacent. The evaluation itself needs no sign
condition, only `dₖ ≠ 0`.

Of the matrix data only the nonvanishing of the symmetrizer on `s`, the diagonal entries at `i` and
on `s`, and the symmetrization identity `dⱼAⱼᵢ = dᵢAᵢⱼ` for `j ∈ s` are used; positive definiteness
enters in `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.sum_apply_mul_apply_lt_four`, which is what turns this value into a

/-- **A cyclic diagram is not of finite type.** On an index type of size at least three, no
finite-type matrix joins every index to its cyclic successor: some `Tₖ,ₖ₊₁` vanishes.

This is the positive-definiteness estimate behind the acyclicity of a finite-type diagram, and the
test vector is the reciprocal `xᵢ = 1/dᵢ` of the symmetrizer. At it the symmetrized form
`∑ᵢⱼ xᵢ dᵢTᵢⱼ xⱼ` collects `2/dᵢ` from each diagonal entry and `Tᵢⱼ/dⱼ` from each off-diagonal one,
and the latter is nonpositive throughout. The two entries of the pair `{k, k+1}` contribute equally,
each `Tₖ₊₁,ₖ/dₖ ≤ -1/dₖ`, since the symmetrization identity `dₖTₖ,ₖ₊₁ = dₖ₊₁Tₖ₊₁,ₖ` is exactly what
makes `Tᵢⱼ/dⱼ` symmetric in `i` and `j`. So the value is at most `∑ₖ 2/dₖ - 2∑ₖ 1/dₖ = 0`, which
positive definiteness forbids. Edges off the cycle only lower the value further, so the cycle need
not be chordless, and the scaling by the symmetrizer is what keeps the test vector rational: the
geometric argument takes unit vectors along the coroots and needs their square roots.

The affine diagrams `Ãₙ` for `n ≥ 2`, the ones whose diagrams are cycles, are what this excludes,
and at three indices every triangle: `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_eq_zero_of_apply_ne_zero` is the
case `m = 3`. The remaining affine diagram `Ã₁` is a double edge on two indices rather than a cycle,
and is excluded instead by the rank-two bound `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_mul_apply_mem_of_ne`. -/
