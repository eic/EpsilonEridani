# The Cartan-Killing classification in rank at most two

The classification of finite-type Cartan matrices proceeds by induction on the number of nodes, and
its base cases are the diagrams with one and with two nodes. This file settles them: an
indecomposable finite-type matrix on two indices is, after a single simultaneous relabelling of its
rows and columns, exactly one of the three standard rank-two Cartan matrices `A₂`, `B₂`, `G₂`, and
on one index it is `A₁`.

Producing the type turns on one invariant. The **Cartan product** `AᵢⱼAⱼᵢ` of the two nodes is
unchanged by relabelling, is at least `1` because the diagram is connected, and is at most `3`
because the matrix is of finite type (`EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.apply_mul_apply_mem_of_ne`). Its three
possible values `1`, `2`, `3` separate the three types, and each value pins the pair of off-diagonal
entries to `(-1, -1)`, to `(-1, -2)` and to `(-1, -3)` respectively. What is left to the
relabelling is then only the *orientation* of the multiple edge, which is what
`EpsilonEridani.HasCartanType` records and why the equivalence produced below is not always the one the
ambient indexing suggests. That the type so produced is the only valid one is not proved here: it is
`EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.eq_of_valid_of_forall_eq`, which says that of any rank.

Two remarks on what the statements say. First, `C 2` is absent from the list, and must be: it is the
transpose of `B 2` and names the same root system, so `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.Valid` keeps only the name
`B 2` (see `EpsilonEridani.hasCartanType_dual_iff_of_rank_le_two`). Uniqueness of the type would be false
without that exclusion. Second, connectedness is a genuine hypothesis at the matrix level, and is
supplied by irreducibility at the root-system level through
`EpsilonEridani.cartanMatrix_ne_zero_of_card_support_eq_two`: a matrix whose two nodes are orthogonal is
the Cartan matrix of `A₁ × A₁`, of finite type but not irreducible.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.DynkinType.valid_and_rank_eq_two_iff`: the valid Dynkin types of rank two are exactly
  `A 2`, `B 2` and `G2`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType.existsUnique_dynkinType_of_card_eq_two`: **an indecomposable finite-type
  matrix on two indices has exactly one valid Dynkin type.**
* `EpsilonEridani.cartanMatrix_ne_zero_of_card_support_eq_two`: the Cartan matrix of a base of an
  irreducible reduced pairing with two simple roots has no off-diagonal zero entry.
* `EpsilonEridani.existsUnique_dynkinType_of_card_support_eq_two`: **an irreducible reduced
  crystallographic finite root system with two simple roots is of exactly one of the types `A₂`,
  `B₂`, `G₂`**; `EpsilonEridani.hasCartanType_of_card_support_eq_two` is the same statement as a three-way
  disjunction.
* `EpsilonEridani.isG2_of_hasCartanType_G2`: a base of type `G₂` makes its pairing Mathlib's
  `RootPairing.IsG2`.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasCartanType_G2_of_isG2`: **conversely, a base of an `IsG2` pairing is of type `G₂`**,
  so the two conditions agree (`EpsilonEridani.hasCartanType_G2_iff_isG2`). This is the direction that
  needs the roots away from the base, and it closes the recognition step that Mathlib's `G₂` file
  lists as a TODO.
* `EpsilonEridani.existsUnique_dynkinType_of_card_support_eq_one`: the rank-one case, which turns on the
  diagonal entry `2` alone and so needs neither finiteness, finite type nor irreducibility.

## References

This file supplies the rank-one and rank-two cases of the Layer 5 milestone "the classification of
finite-type Cartan matrices" of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/RootSystems/README.md`, whose
statement `existsUnique_dynkinType` these theorems specialize. See Bourbaki, *Lie Groups and Lie
Algebras, Chapters 4-6*, Ch. VI §4, and Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation
Theory*, §11.1, where the rank-two diagrams are enumerated first for exactly this reason.

The two diagonal equations follow from the two matrices having constant diagonal `2`, so only the

`EpsilonEridani.existsUnique_dynkinType_of_card_eq_one`, this takes the diagonal equation itself rather
than `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteType`, which is what the root-system-level callers have available. -/

only that *some* pair of roots pair to `-3`, while the conclusion is about the two simple roots of
the given base.

The bridge is root length. A pair of roots pairing to `-3` has its transposed pairing `-1`, so the
two differ in squared length by the factor `3`; every root has the length of a simple root
(`RootPairing.RootPositiveForm.exists_mem_support_rootLength_eq`), so two of the simple
roots already differ by that factor, and reading the ratio back off the Cartan matrix makes their
two off-diagonal entries `-3` and `-1`. Since the base has two elements, these entries and the
diagonal entries `2` identify its Cartan matrix with the standard matrix of `G₂`. -/

/-- **Cartan type `G₂` and Mathlib's `RootPairing.IsG2` are the same condition.** The right-hand
side does not mention the base, so an irreducible reduced crystallographic finite root pairing with
one base of type `G₂` has every base of type `G₂`. The `IsG2` hypothesis of
`EpsilonEridani.hasCartanType_G2_of_isG2` is taken as an argument rather than as an instance, so that it
can be supplied by the right-hand side here. -/
