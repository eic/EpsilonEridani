# The deletion condition and the subword property

A word in the simple reflections whose length exceeds the number of inversions of the element it
spells is wasteful, and the strong exchange condition says exactly where the waste is: two of its
letters can be deleted without changing the element. Iterating the deletion until no waste is left
extracts from any word a *subword* of least length spelling the same element.

The deletion is located by walking along the word until the first prefix that is already wasteful.
The prefix one letter shorter is not wasteful, so the letter just read is an inversion of the
element that prefix spells, and the strong exchange condition deletes a letter from that prefix.
Deleting the letter just read as well leaves a word two letters shorter spelling the same element.

The subword form is what makes these statements usable downstream. The deleted positions are named,
so the same deletions can be replayed verbatim on the corresponding word over any other family of
generators indexed by `b.support`, in particular over the generators of the presented Coxeter
group. The bare existence of some shorter word inside the Weyl group names no word over those
generators to carry the assertion back through the presentation map; this is the form in which the
deletion condition enters the word property behind Tits' theorem.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_wordProd_eraseIdx_eraseIdx_eq` is the deletion condition: a word longer than the
  inversion count of the element it spells has two letters that can be deleted.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_sublist_wordProd_eq_and_length_eq_ncard_inversions` is the subword property:
  every word contains a subword of least length spelling the same element.
* `EpsilonEridani.ncard_inversions_wordProd_eq_length_iff` records that a word is of least length exactly
  when no two of its letters can be deleted.

This file continues the "inversion sets and the exchange step" item of Layer 1 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/RootSystems/README.md` towards the Coxeter presentation
`weylCoxeterSystem` of Layer 2, whose completeness half is proved through the exchange condition at
root level. The deletion condition and the subword property are the standard packaging of that
step; see J. E. Humphreys, *Reflection Groups and Coxeter Groups*, CUP (1990), §1.7 and §5.8, and
Bourbaki, *Lie Groups and Lie Algebras*, Chapters 4--6, Ch. IV, §1.5.
