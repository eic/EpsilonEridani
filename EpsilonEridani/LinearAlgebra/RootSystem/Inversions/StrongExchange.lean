# The strong exchange condition and the identity criterion for inversion sets

If a word in the simple reflections spells a Weyl-group element sending a positive root to a
negative root, then appending the reflection in that root to the word is spelled by the word with
one of its letters deleted. This is the strong exchange condition, and it is the missing half of
the identification of the inversion set as the obstruction to being the identity: an element with
an empty inversion set is spelled by the empty word, so it is the identity.

Two features of the statement are what make it usable and are not shared by the weaker "some
shorter word exists" form. The reflecting root ranges over *all* positive roots, not just the
simple ones, so the condition applies to an arbitrary reflection of the Weyl group; and the
shorter word is `l.eraseIdx j` for a named position `j`, a deletion that can be replayed verbatim
on the corresponding word over any other family of generators indexed by `b.support`, in particular
over the generators of the presented Coxeter group. The weaker form asserts only that some shorter
word exists inside the Weyl group; it names no word over those generators to carry the assertion
back through the presentation map, which is why the word property behind Tits' theorem consumes the
deletion form.

The proof is an induction on the word. Peeling off the leading simple reflection `sⱼ`, either the
shorter word already sends the root to a negative root, and the inductive hypothesis deletes a
letter from it, or the shorter word sends it to a positive root that `sⱼ` makes negative. In the
second case that positive root must be the simple root `αⱼ` itself, because a simple reflection
permutes the remaining positive roots, and then conjugation identifies `sⱼ` with the appended
reflection, so the leading letter is the one deleted.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_wordProd_eraseIdx_eq_mul_ofIdx` is the strong exchange condition.
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_one_of_inversions_eq_empty` and `EpsilonEridani.inversions_eq_empty_iff_eq_one` say that the
  inversion set of a Weyl-group element is empty exactly when the element is the identity.
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_one_of_mapsTo_posRoots` restates this as: a Weyl-group element keeping every positive
  root positive is the identity.
* `EpsilonEridani.inversions_nonempty_of_ne_one` and `EpsilonEridani.ncard_inversions_pos_of_ne_one` are the
  contrapositive forms used to detect nontrivial Weyl-group elements.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_mem_support_mem_inversions_of_ne_one` sharpens the first of those to a *simple*
  inversion, which is what makes induction along right multiplication by simple reflections
  available.
