# Length equals inversions

The number of positive roots that a Weyl-group element sends to negative roots is exactly the
number of letters in a shortest word in the simple reflections spelling that element. One
inequality is the exchange step: a letter changes the inversion count by exactly one, so a word of
`k` letters cannot spell an element with more than `k` inversions. The other is a descent
induction: an element other than the identity inverts some *simple* root, and removing that simple
reflection from the right lowers the inversion count by one, so a word of exactly as many letters
as there are inversions is built up one letter at a time.

The identification is packaged as an `IsLeast` statement, `EpsilonEridani.isLeast_ncard_inversions`, so
that both halves are available at once. Everything here is stated and proved purely at the root
level, in terms of `EpsilonEridani.inversions` and `EpsilonEridani.wordProd`: no Coxeter presentation is
mentioned, assumed, or needed. Downstream it *is* the root-level form of the Coxeter length of a
Weyl group, because Mathlib defines `CoxeterSystem.length` to be exactly the least length of a
word in the simple reflections; so once the Coxeter presentation lands, the Coxeter-length
spelling of this theorem is a rewrite of it rather than a further theorem.

The subadditivity, inversion-invariance and descent consequences recorded here are the standard
length-function axioms in their inversion-count spelling.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ncard_inversions_wordProd_le_length`: a word spells an element with at most as many
  inversions as the word has letters.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_wordProd_eq_and_length_eq_ncard_inversions`: some word spells the element with
  exactly as many letters as it has inversions.
* `EpsilonEridani.isLeast_ncard_inversions`: the inversion count is the least length of a word spelling
  the element.
* `EpsilonEridani.ncard_inversions_wordProd_modEq_length` and
  `EpsilonEridani.length_modEq_length_of_wordProd_eq`: every word spelling a given element has the same
  length parity, namely that of the inversion count.
* `EpsilonEridani.ncard_inversions_inv` and `EpsilonEridani.ncard_inversions_mul_le`: the inversion count is
  invariant under inversion and subadditive.
* `EpsilonEridani.ncard_inversions_mul_ofIdx_lt_of_mem`,
  `EpsilonEridani.ncard_inversions_mul_ofIdx_lt_iff` and
  `EpsilonEridani.lt_ncard_inversions_mul_ofIdx_iff`: right multiplication by the reflection in a
  positive root lowers the inversion count exactly when that root is an inversion. The reflecting
  root need not be simple, because the strong exchange condition does not require it to be.
* `EpsilonEridani.ncard_inversions_ofIdx_mul_lt_iff` and
  `EpsilonEridani.lt_ncard_inversions_ofIdx_mul_iff`: the same criteria for left multiplication, read off
  the inverse element.

## References

This file iterates over a whole word the root-level exchange step of "Inversion sets and the
exchange step" in Layer 1 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/RootSystems/README.md`, the item
that asks for exactly that iteration: the step "iterated, is the exchange/deletion condition for
the geometric action and the combinatorial core that Layer 2's generation and presentation
consume". Nothing beyond that Layer 1 material is consumed, and all of it is on `main`
(`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/Inversions/StrongExchange.lean` and its imports).

What Layer 2's presentation takes from the iteration is that a nonempty word of least length
spells an element other than the identity, equivalently that its inversion set is nonempty: that
is how the roadmap proves the lift from the presented group injective in Tits' theorem, "a
nonempty reduced word has a nonempty inversion set". This file therefore precedes
`weylCoxeterSystem` rather than waiting on it, and the Coxeter-length identity
`(weylCoxeterSystem b).length w = (inversions b w).ncard` is not proved here.

The argument is the one in J. E. Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation
Theory*, GTM 9, Ch. III, §10.3, and in Bourbaki, *Lie Groups and Lie Algebras*, Chapters 4--6.
