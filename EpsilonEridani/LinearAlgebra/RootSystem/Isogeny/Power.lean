# Powers of an isogeny of a root pairing with itself

An isogeny of a root pairing with itself can be composed with itself, and the Suzuki and Ree
groups are cut out by the *odd powers* of a special isogeny rather than by the isogeny itself.
This file gives the isogenies of a fixed root pairing with itself their monoid structure under
composition, so that `f ^ n` is available with the whole `Monoid` API, and computes the square of
a power of a special isogeny.

The monoid is the one composition already determines: `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.comp` is
associative with `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.id` as a two-sided unit, and nothing new is proved to
put it together. What the monoid buys is the identity

```text
f ^ n * f ^ n = smulId P (c ^ n)      whenever      f * f = smulId P c,
```

`EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.pow_mul_self_eq_smulId`, which is pure monoid algebra: `f ^ n * f ^ n`
is `(f * f) ^ n`. Read at `c` the defining characteristic and `n` odd, this is the root-datum form
of `steinberg (m) ^ 2 = Frob_(p ^ (2 * m + 1))` for `steinberg (m) = τ ^ (2 * m + 1)`. It is stated
for every `n`, since the restriction to odd exponents belongs to the finite-group construction and
not to this identity.

All three of the weight map, the coweight map and the index bijection are monoid homomorphisms out
of this monoid, the coweight map into the opposite endomorphism monoid because `comp` reverses on
that component. These declarations adapt the Mathlib API `RootPairing.Hom.weightHom`,
`RootPairing.Hom.coweightHom` and `RootPairing.Hom.indexHom` for the endomorphism monoid of a root
pairing, and the powers of all three components are `map_pow`.

Two further maps into the monoid are recorded because the Steinberg endomorphisms of the twisted
families are built from them: the automorphisms of the root pairing land in it multiplicatively,
`EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.ofEquivHom`, and the scalings are central in it,
`EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.commute_smulId`. Together they let a power of an automorphism times a
scaling be separated into a power of each.

The same hypothesis also splits the powers themselves: an even power is a scaling, and an odd power
is a scaling times `f`, so an odd power permutes the roots exactly as `f` does while multiplying
its exponents and its weight and coweight maps by `c ^ m`. The three special isogenies of `B₂`,
`G₂` and `F₄` are the instance this exists for; their power relations are in
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/Isogeny/Special.lean`, where they join the square relations they
come from.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.instMonoid`: the composition monoid of isogenies of a root pairing
  with itself.
* `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.weightHom`, `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.coweightHom` and
  `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.indexHom`: the weight map, the coweight map and the index bijection
  as monoid homomorphisms, the coweight map into the opposite endomorphism monoid.
* `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.smulIdHom`: the scalings, as a monoid homomorphism out of `ℕ+`.
* `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.ofEquivHom`: the automorphisms of the root pairing, as a monoid
  homomorphism into the isogeny monoid.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.ofEquiv_pow`: an automorphism and the isogeny it becomes have the
  same powers.
* `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.commute_smulId`: a scaling commutes with every endo-isogeny.
* `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.pow_mul_self_eq_smulId`: a power of an isogeny whose square is a
  scaling squares to the corresponding power of that scaling.
* `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.pow_two_mul_eq_smulId` and
  `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.pow_two_mul_add_one_eq_smulId_mul`: such an isogeny has scalings for
  its even powers, and a scaling times itself for its odd ones.
* `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.exponent_pow`: the exponent of an iterate is the product along the
  corresponding orbit of indices.
* `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.indexEquiv_pow_two_mul_add_one`,
  `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.exponent_pow_two_mul_add_one`,
  `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.weightMap_pow_two_mul_add_one` and
  `EpsilonEridani.RootPairingIsogeny.coweightMap_pow_two_mul_add_one`: an odd power permutes the roots as
  the isogeny does and multiplies its exponents and its two lattice maps by `c ^ m`.

The odd powers of the special isogeny are what milestone L2 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md` asks for, "`steinberg(m) = τ_X ^ (2m + 1)`,
`steinberg(m) ^ 2 = Frob_(p ^ (2m + 1))`", once the special isogeny itself has been lifted from
root data to the pinned group schemes of Layer 9 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`.
