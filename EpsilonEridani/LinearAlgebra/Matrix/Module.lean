# Vanishing of a family fixed by a matrix

A family `y : n → P` in a module over a ring `A` satisfying `yᵢ = ∑ⱼ Bᵢⱼ • yⱼ` is exactly a
fixed point of the `Matrix n n A`-action on `n → P`, so it is killed by `1 - B`. If `1 - B` is
a unit, `y` vanishes.

This is pure algebra: no topology, and `A` need not be commutative. It is stated here rather
than beside the topological criteria that produce `IsUnit (1 - B)`, so that consumers do not
have to import a ring theory they do not use — in particular it applies where `P` is an
abstract subquotient with no topology of its own.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.eq_zero_of_isUnit_one_sub_of_forall_eq_sum_smul`: a family fixed by `B` vanishes as
  soon as `1 - B` is a unit.

## References

* [S. Bosch, U. Güntzer and R. Remmert, *Non-Archimedean Analysis*][bosch-guntzer-remmert],
  §3.7.2/1, where this is the algebraic engine behind closedness of finitely generated
  submodules.

/-- **Nakayama once `1 - B` is known to be a unit.** A family with `yᵢ = ∑ⱼ Bᵢⱼ • yⱼ` is killed by
`1 - B` under the `Matrix n n A`-action on `n → P`, so invertibility of `1 - B` forces `y = 0`.

Nothing topological appears: `P` carries no topology, and `A` is an arbitrary ring — the matrix
action needs no commutativity. -/
