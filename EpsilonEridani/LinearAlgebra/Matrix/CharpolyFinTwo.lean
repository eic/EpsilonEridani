# The homogeneous characteristic form of a `2 × 2` matrix

Mathlib's `Matrix.charpoly_fin_two` records the characteristic polynomial of a `2 × 2` matrix as
`X ^ 2 - C M.trace * X + C M.det`. This file records the *homogeneous* two-variable form of the
same fact, evaluated directly as a determinant rather than through `Polynomial`:

`(r • M - s • 1).det = M.det * r ^ 2 - M.trace * (r * s) + s ^ 2`.

The two are close. Applying `charpoly_fin_two` to `r • M`, evaluating at `s` with
`Matrix.eval_charpoly`, and simplifying the resulting `Matrix.trace_smul` and `Matrix.det_smul`
does prove the identity below — in about twice the lines, and only over a `[Nontrivial R]`, which
`charpoly_fin_two` requires and the statement here does not. What this file adds is therefore the
*name* and the `Polynomial`-free form: an equation between two ring elements over any `CommRing`,
which is the shape a caller with matrix data in hand wants to rewrite with.

Read as a binary quadratic form in `(r, s)`, the right-hand side has leading coefficient `M.det`,
middle coefficient `-M.trace` and constant coefficient `1`, so its discriminant is
`M.trace ^ 2 - 4 * M.det` — which is Mathlib's `Matrix.discr` by `Matrix.discr_fin_two`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Matrix.det_smul_sub_smul_one_fin_two`: the identity displayed above.
* `EpsilonEridani.Matrix.det_smul_sub_smul_one_of_card_eq_two`: the same for a square matrix on any
  index type of cardinality two, matching the relationship Mathlib's
  `Matrix.charpoly_of_card_eq_two` bears to `Matrix.charpoly_fin_two`.

## Provenance

Ported from the AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (Apache-2.0), revision `513e83879e2f`, file
`HasseWeil/WeilPairing/MatrixDet.lean`, declaration `det_smul_sub_smul_one_fin_two`.

The file's two other declarations are deliberately not ported: `det_smul_sub_smul_one_fin_two_of`
rewrites the identity under hypotheses `M.det = q` and `M.trace = t`, and `det_one_sub_fin_two` is
the `r = s = -1` instance. Both are one-line consequences better written at their call sites than
carried as API.

/-- The determinant of the pencil `r • M - s • 1` of a `2 × 2` matrix, as a binary quadratic form
in `(r, s)` whose coefficients are the determinant and the trace of `M`.

This is the homogeneous form of `Matrix.charpoly_fin_two`, from which it can also be derived by
applying that lemma to the matrix `r • M` and evaluating the resulting polynomial at the scalar
`s`; stated directly it needs no `[Nontrivial R]` hypothesis and no `Polynomial`. -/
