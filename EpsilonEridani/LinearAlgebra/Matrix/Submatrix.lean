# Permutations preserving a square matrix

A permutation `σ` of the index set of a square matrix `M` *preserves* `M` when
`M.submatrix σ σ = M`. This file records the three closure properties
`EpsilonEridani.submatrix_perm_refl`, `EpsilonEridani.submatrix_perm_trans` and `EpsilonEridani.submatrix_perm_symm`,
and packages them as the subgroup `EpsilonEridani.matrixSymmetryGroup` of `Equiv.Perm`.

For the Cartan matrix of a Dynkin diagram these permutations are the diagram symmetries.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.matrixSymmetryGroup`: the group of permutations preserving a given square matrix.

/-- The identity permutation preserves every square matrix.

This is Mathlib's `Matrix.submatrix_id_id` with the reindexing spelled as `Equiv.refl` rather than
as `id`. The two are equal only by unfolding the coercion `⇑(Equiv.refl B) = id`, which `rw` and
`simp` do not do: a statement carrying `Matrix.submatrix_id_id` where a proof about
`⇑(Equiv.refl B)` is expected is not type-correct at their `implicit` transparency, so no such
statement can be rewritten with. -/

    M.submatrix (Equiv.refl B) (Equiv.refl B) = M := by
  rw [Equiv.coe_refl, Matrix.submatrix_id_id]

/-- If `σ` and `τ` preserve a square matrix then so does `σ.trans τ`. -/

    M.submatrix (σ.trans τ) (σ.trans τ) = M := by

/-- If `σ` preserves a square matrix then so does `σ.symm`. -/
theorem submatrix_perm_symm (hσ : M.submatrix σ σ = M) : M.submatrix σ.symm σ.symm = M :=
  calc M.submatrix ⇑σ.symm ⇑σ.symm
