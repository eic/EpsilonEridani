# The order of `GL₂` over a finite field

Mathlib's `Matrix.card_GL_field` gives `|GL n 𝔽_q| = ∏ i, (qⁿ - qⁱ)`, which in size two reads
`(q² - 1)(q² - q)`. That form is a product of differences, and every index computation in `GL₂`
divides it by the order of a subgroup, so what is wanted is the factored form
`(q - 1)² · q · (q + 1)`, where the natural subtraction has already been carried out. It is
recorded here in the two associations the two maximal tori call for: the split torus has order
`(q - 1)²` and the non-split one `q² - 1`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.natCard_GL_fin_two`: `|GL₂(𝔽_q)| = (q - 1)² · q(q + 1)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.natCard_GL_fin_two_eq_sq_sub_one_mul`: `|GL₂(𝔽_q)| = (q² - 1) · q(q - 1)`.
