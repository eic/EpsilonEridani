# Change of scalars on general linear groups

`Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.map f : GL n R →* GL n S` applies a ring hom `f : R →+* S` entrywise.
Mathlib gives its functoriality (`map_id`, `map_comp`, `map_comp_apply`) but says nothing about
injectivity, nor about how the map interacts with the positive-determinant subgroup — both of
which a construction transporting a group of matrices along a change of scalars needs.

## Main results

* `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.map_injective`: entrywise application of an injective ring hom is
  injective on general linear groups.
* `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.map_mem_glpos`: a strictly monotone ring hom carries `GLPos` to
  `GLPos`, so a change of scalars restricts to the positive-determinant subgroups.
* `Subgroup.map_mapGL`: extending a subgroup of `SL(n, R)` to `GL n S` and then to `GL n T`
  agrees with extending it directly to `GL n T`.

/-- A strictly monotone change of scalars restricts to the positive-determinant subgroups.

This is the side condition for cutting `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.map f` down to a homomorphism
`GLPos n R →* GLPos n S`; for `f = algebraMap ℚ ℝ` the hypothesis is `Rat.cast_strictMono`.
Contrast `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.toGLPos`, which lands in `GLPos` because the determinant
is `1`: here it is only positive, and monotonicity of `f` is what keeps it so. -/
