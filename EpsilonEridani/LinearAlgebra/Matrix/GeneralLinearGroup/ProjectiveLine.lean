# The cosets of the Borel subgroup of `GL₂` are the projective line

The coset space `GL₂(F) ⧸ B` of the Borel subgroup of invertible upper-triangular matrices is the
**projective line** over `F`: a coset `g B` remembers exactly the line spanned by the first column
of `g`, because right multiplication by an upper-triangular matrix rescales that column. Mathlib
already models the projective line as `OnePoint F`, with the Möbius action of `GL (Fin 2) F` on it
(`OnePoint.instGLAction`), and this file supplies the missing bridge: the Borel subgroup is the
stabilizer of the point at infinity (`EpsilonEridani.GL2Borel.stabilizer_infty`), and the action is
transitive, so translating `∞` identifies the two
(`EpsilonEridani.GL2Borel.quotientEquivOnePoint`), equivariantly.

The point of the identification is the **fixed-coset count**, which the bridge turns into a
fixed-point count on `OnePoint F`, where Mathlib's `OnePoint.smul_infty_eq_self_iff` and
`Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.fixpointPolynomial_aeval_eq_zero_iff` compute it. For an element
`!![a, b; 0, d]` of the Borel subgroup itself, `∞` is fixed and the fixed affine points are the
roots of the linear equation `(d - a) t = b`; so there are two fixed points when `a ≠ d`, and one
when `a = d` and `b ≠ 0`. A scalar matrix is central, so it fixes every coset, and an element with
no upper-triangular conjugate fixes none.

Those four statements are read off for the four families of conjugacy classes of `GL₂(𝔽_q)`: a
scalar matrix fixes all `q + 1` cosets, a diagonal matrix with distinct entries `2`, a Jordan block
`1`, and an element of the non-split torus that does not come from `F` fixes `0`. Those four
numbers, less one, are the character values of the Steinberg representation.

Only the scalar count needs `F` to be finite, and only because it is the one whose value is the
number of points; the other three are the same over any field, and the two general Borel counts
hold there too.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.GL2Borel.quotientEquivOnePoint`: the identification `GL₂(F) ⧸ B ≃ OnePoint F` of the
  coset space with Mathlib's model of the projective line, by translating the point at infinity.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GL2Borel.stabilizer_infty`: the Borel subgroup is the stabilizer of `∞` for the Möbius
  action of `GL₂(F)` on `OnePoint F`.
* `EpsilonEridani.GL2Borel.quotientEquivOnePoint_smul`: that identification is equivariant, whence
  `EpsilonEridani.GL2Borel.natCard_fixedCosets_eq_ncard`, the fixed cosets of `g` are counted by its fixed
  points on `OnePoint F`.
* `EpsilonEridani.GL2Borel.natCard_fixedCosets_of_mem_of_diagonal_ne` and
  `EpsilonEridani.GL2Borel.natCard_fixedCosets_of_mem_of_diagonal_eq_of_upperRight_ne_zero`: an
  upper-triangular element fixes exactly `2` cosets when its diagonal entries differ, and exactly
  `1` when they agree and it is not diagonal.
* `EpsilonEridani.GL2Borel.scalar_smul_quotient_eq_self` and
  `EpsilonEridani.GL2Borel.natCard_fixedCosets_eq_zero`: a scalar matrix fixes every coset, and an element
  with no upper-triangular conjugate fixes none.
* `EpsilonEridani.GL2Borel.natCard_fixedCosets_scalar`, `EpsilonEridani.GL2Borel.natCard_fixedCosets_diagGL`,
  `EpsilonEridani.GL2Borel.natCard_fixedCosets_jordanGL` and
  `EpsilonEridani.GL2Borel.natCard_fixedCosets_gl2NonSplitTorusHom`: the counts `q + 1`, `2`, `1` and `0`
  for the four families of conjugacy classes of `GL₂(𝔽_q)`.
