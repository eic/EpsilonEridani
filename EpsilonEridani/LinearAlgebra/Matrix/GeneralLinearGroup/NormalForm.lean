# The four conjugacy normal forms of `GL₂` over a finite field

`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/ConjugacyClasses.lean` classifies the conjugacy
classes of `GL₂(F)` by trace and determinant, with the companion matrix of the characteristic
polynomial as the representative of each non-scalar class. That representative is uniform but
anonymous. This file replaces it, over a finite field, by the four **named** normal forms the
character theory of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` is written against:

* a **central** scalar matrix `a • 1`;
* a **split semisimple** `EpsilonEridani.diagGL ![a, b]` with `a ≠ b`;
* a **non-semisimple** Jordan block `EpsilonEridani.jordanGL a 1`;
* an **elliptic** `EpsilonEridani.GL2NonSplitTorusHom F E hE x`, multiplication by an element of a
  degree-`2` extension `E/F` that does not lie in `F`.

`EpsilonEridani.exists_isConj_normalForm` is the resulting statement that every element of `GL₂(F)` is
conjugate to one of the four. It is what turns the four character values computed at these normal
forms in `EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/CharacterValues.lean` into a full row of
the character table of `GL₂(𝔽_q)`: a character is a class function, so a row is determined once the
normal forms exhaust the classes.

The two non-central split forms need no finiteness and no extension. Each is the same check
against `EpsilonEridani.isConj_iff_of_notMem_range_scalar`: the normal form is not scalar, and its trace
and determinant are the prescribed ones. What the roots of `X² - t X + d` are is the only thing
that distinguishes them — two distinct roots give `diagGL`, a repeated root gives `jordanGL` —
and only in the repeated-root case need non-scalarness be assumed: a scalar matrix has a repeated
root, so prescribing two distinct roots, or a root outside `F`, already rules it out.

The elliptic case is the one that needs a quadratic extension, and it is where the finiteness of
`F` enters. Multiplication by `x : E` has trace `Tr_{E/F} x` and determinant `N_{E/F} x`
(`EpsilonEridani.GL2NonSplitTorus.trace_gl2NonSplitTorusHom` and
`EpsilonEridani.GL2NonSplitTorus.val_det_gl2NonSplitTorusHom`), so the normal form is pinned by the
quadratic-extension lemmas of `EpsilonEridani/FieldTheory/Quadratic.lean`:
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.trace_eq_of_mul_self_eq` and `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.norm_eq_of_mul_self_eq` identify
those with `t` and `d` for an `x` outside `F` satisfying `x² = t x - d`, and
`EpsilonEridani.exists_mul_self_eq_of_finite` supplies such an `x` over a finite field.

Uniqueness — that the four families are pairwise disjoint and that the parameters are determined up
to the evident symmetries `(a, b) ↦ (b, a)` and `x ↦ x^q` — is the second half of the file, and it
runs on the same classification. Being scalar is a conjugacy invariant on its own
(`EpsilonEridani.not_isConj_of_mem_range_scalar`), which separates the central family from the other
three; that is the one separation trace and determinant do not make, a scalar and a Jordan block
with the same eigenvalue having the same characteristic polynomial. Among the three non-central
families the characteristic polynomial does all the work, and what separates them is how it
factors: two distinct roots in `F` for `diagGL`, a repeated root for `jordanGL`, and no root in `F`
for the elliptic form. Reading that off is one equation per pair, and in the elliptic case it needs
the torus parameter `x` to satisfy the quadratic built from its own trace and norm,
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.mul_self_eq_trace_mul_sub_norm`: an eigenvalue of a split or a Jordan form
lies in `F`, and `x` does not.

None of those statements needs `F` finite, and the split and non-semisimple ones need no extension
at all. What does need finiteness is the symmetry `x ↦ x^q` of the elliptic parameter, which is
`EpsilonEridani.GL2NonSplitTorus.isConj_gl2NonSplitTorusHom_iff` in
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/ConjugacyClasses.lean`. Together with the results
here it says that the four families, with their parameters read up to the two symmetries, index the
conjugacy classes of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` without repetition — the description by named data of the indexing
that `EpsilonEridani.conjClassesGLFinTwoEquiv` supplies anonymously.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isConj_diagGL_of_trace_of_det`, `EpsilonEridani.isConj_jordanGL_one_of_trace_of_det` and
  `EpsilonEridani.isConj_gl2NonSplitTorusHom_of_trace_of_det`: **the three non-central normal forms**, each
  characterized by the roots of its characteristic polynomial, read off the trace and the
  determinant.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_isConj_normalForm`: **every element of `GL₂(F)`, for `F` finite with a degree-`2`
  extension `E`, is conjugate to one of the four normal forms.**
* `EpsilonEridani.not_isConj_scalar_diagGL`, `EpsilonEridani.not_isConj_scalar_jordanGL_one`,
  `EpsilonEridani.not_isConj_scalar_gl2NonSplitTorusHom`, `EpsilonEridani.not_isConj_diagGL_jordanGL_one`,
  `EpsilonEridani.not_isConj_diagGL_gl2NonSplitTorusHom` and
  `EpsilonEridani.not_isConj_jordanGL_one_gl2NonSplitTorusHom`: **the four families are pairwise
  disjoint.**
* `EpsilonEridani.isConj_diagGL_iff` and `EpsilonEridani.isConj_jordanGL_one_iff`: **the parameters inside a
  family are determined**, the split family up to the transposition of its two eigenvalues and the
  non-semisimple family outright. For the central family this is `EpsilonEridani.isConj_scalar_iff`, which
  needs nothing about `GL₂` and lives with the other scalar invariants in
  `EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/ConjugacyClasses.lean`.

The normal forms below are written against the pair `![a, b]` and the Jordan parameter `1`, while
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/Diagonal/Basic.lean` and
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/ScalarUnipotent.lean` state non-scalarity, the
trace and the determinant for a general family and a general off-diagonal entry. These six private
lemmas do that adaptation once, so that no proof below recomputes the trace, the determinant or the
non-scalarity of a normal form from its matrix entries. -/

`EpsilonEridani.diagGL_const` with the family spelled as the pair the normal forms are written against. It
is what lets the three split statements below whose conclusion survives a repeated eigenvalue carry
no hypothesis on their two parameters. -/

/-- **A Jordan block is not conjugate to an elliptic normal form.** Equal traces and determinants
make `x` a double root of `(X - a)²`, so `x` would be `a`, which lies in `F`. No hypothesis is
needed on `x`: a torus parameter inside `F` gives the corresponding scalar, which is not conjugate
to a Jordan block either. -/
