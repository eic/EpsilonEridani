# The adjugate of an invertible matrix

The adjugate of an invertible matrix is invertible, so `Matrix.adjugate` restricts to a map
`GL n R → GL n R`. Its inverse is exhibited directly, without dividing by the determinant:
`adjugate` is anti-multiplicative and sends `1` to `1`, so `adjugate g⁻¹` inverts `adjugate g`
on the nose. That keeps the construction over an arbitrary commutative ring — no field, no
`det ≠ 0` side condition, and nothing to discharge at a call site.

Over a group of determinant-one matrices it is the inverse, and in size two it is an
involution. Those are the two ingredients a Hecke-pair anti-involution needs from the adjugate;
the anti-involution itself also requires stability of the group and the monoid under the map,
which is proved where those objects live, not here.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.adjugateGL`: the adjugate as a map `GL n R → GL n R`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.adjugateGL_one`, `EpsilonEridani.adjugateGL_mul`: `adj(1) = 1` and `adj(gh) = adj(h) adj(g)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.adjugateGL_eq_inv`: on determinant one, `adj(g) = g⁻¹`.
* `EpsilonEridani.adjugateGL_mapGL`: on a special-linear image, `adj(mapGL σ) = mapGL σ⁻¹`.
* `EpsilonEridani.adjugateGL_adjugateGL`: in size two, `adj` is an involution.
* `Matrix.adjugate_eq_det_smul_inv`: `adj(A) = det A • A⁻¹` for `A` of unit determinant, at
  any finite size.
* `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.adjugateGL_eq_scalar_mul_inv`: `adj(g) = (det g · I) * g⁻¹`.

/-- **The adjugate of an invertible matrix**, again invertible.

The inverse is `adjugate g⁻¹` rather than anything built from the determinant: `adjugate` is
anti-multiplicative, so the two adjugates multiply to `adjugate (g⁻¹ g) = adjugate 1 = 1`. -/

group of determinant-one matrices, where it is then an anti-automorphism. -/

/-- **Adjugate is inversion on a special-linear image.** An element of `SL n R` has determinant
one in every `R`-algebra `S`, so `adjugateGL` is inversion on its image, and `mapGL S` is a
monoid map. This is `adjugateGL_eq_inv` in the form its consumers meet: the determinant
hypothesis is discharged once here rather than at each call site. -/

/-- **In size two the adjugate is an involution.** `adjugate` squares to
`det ^ (card n - 2) • id`, and the size-two hypothesis makes that exponent vanish. -/

/-- **The adjugate is the determinant times the inverse**: `adj A = det A • A⁻¹`, whenever the
determinant is a unit. `Matrix.inv_def` read backwards, at any finite size. -/

/-- **The adjugate of an invertible matrix is its inverse rescaled by the determinant**:
`adj g = (det g · I) * g⁻¹`, in `GL n R`. Writing it as a product with a scalar matrix is what
lets a multiplicative action be *split* along the adjugate — the weight-`k` slash is, in
`EpsilonEridani/NumberTheory/ModularForms/SlashAdjugate.lean`.

In size two, and only there, the adjugate is an involution (`adjugateGL_adjugateGL`); it is that
specialisation that the modular literature calls the main involution and writes `α^ι`.
