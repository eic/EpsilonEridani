# Upper transvections

This file records that an upper transvection belongs to the upper-triangular subgroup. This lets
upper transvections be used as elements of the Borel subgroup `B` in the construction of the
standard Tits system of `GLₙ₊₁`: they appear when an element of `B` is factored as a product with
a transvection at a simple root, and, together with their conjugates by permutation matrices, in
the proof that `B` and the permutation matrices generate `GLₙ(k)`.
