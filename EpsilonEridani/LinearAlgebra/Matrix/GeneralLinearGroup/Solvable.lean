# Nonsolvability of `GL₂`

If a field contains an element `a` with `a ≠ 0` and `a² ≠ 1`, then `GL₂` is nonsolvable.
In particular, this holds over every infinite field.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.not_isSolvable_fin_two`: `GL₂` is not solvable when the
  field contains an element outside the roots of `X * (X² - 1)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.not_isSolvable_fin_two_of_infinite`: the infinite-field
  specialization.
