# Unipotent matrix automorphisms

This file relates unipotence of the natural linear action of an invertible matrix to nilpotence
of the matrix obtained by subtracting the identity.

## Main declarations

* `LinearMap.GeneralLinearGroup.isUnipotent_toLin_iff` — a matrix acts unipotently exactly when
  subtracting the identity from the matrix gives a nilpotent matrix.

/-- An element of the general linear group is unipotent in its natural representation exactly
when subtracting the identity from its underlying matrix gives a nilpotent matrix. -/
