# Parabolic elements of `PSL(2, R)`

Mathlib classifies `2 × 2` matrices as parabolic, elliptic or hyperbolic
(`Matrix.IsParabolic`, with the dot-notation synonym `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.IsParabolic`).
Being parabolic is invariant under negation (`Matrix.isParabolic_neg_iff`), so over a ring without
zero divisors, where the center of `SL(2, R)` is `{±1}`, it descends to the projective special
linear group `PSL(2, R) = SL(2, R) ⧸ {±1}`. This is the notion of a parabolic Möbius
transformation which does not depend on a choice of matrix representative.

The model parabolic elements are the translations `upperRightHom x`, the classes of the
transvections `!![1, x; 0, 1]`, which act on the projective line by `z ↦ z + x`. Over a field
of characteristic other than two every parabolic element of `PSL(2, K)` is conjugate to one of
them; that classification, which runs through the action on the projective line, is in
`EpsilonEridani.Topology.Compactification.OnePoint.ProjectiveLine`.

## Main declarations

* `Matrix.ProjectiveSpecialLinearGroup.IsParabolic`: an element of `PSL(2, R)` is parabolic when
  it has a parabolic representative, and `isParabolic_mk_iff`: then every representative is.
* `Matrix.ProjectiveSpecialLinearGroup.isParabolic_conj_iff`: parabolicity is invariant under
  conjugation, `isParabolic_inv_iff`: under inversion, and `IsParabolic.pow`, `IsParabolic.zpow`:
  under nonzero powers in characteristic zero.
* `Matrix.ProjectiveSpecialLinearGroup.upperRightHom`: the translations `x ↦ !![1, x; 0, 1]`, as
  an injective additive character `R → PSL(2, R)`, parabolic exactly away from `x = 0`
  (`isParabolic_upperRightHom_iff`); `mul_zpow_mul_inv_eq_upperRightHom`: a conjugate of a
  translation by `w` has its `n`-th power conjugate to the translation by `n * w`.
