# The commutant of a `2 × 2` matrix

A `2 × 2` matrix over a field is **regular** as soon as it is not scalar: it is then cyclic
(nonderogatory), and the matrices commuting with it are exactly the polynomials in it. In size `2`
those polynomials are the affine combinations `a • 1 + b • M`, so the commutant of a non-scalar
`M : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F` is the two-dimensional algebra `F[M]` — in particular it is
commutative.

Mathlib's `Matrix.mem_range_scalar_iff_commute_transvectionStruct` describes the matrices commuting
with *everything*; what is proved here is the commutant of a *single* matrix, in size two, read off
the three independent entry equations of `M * N = N * M` by splitting on which of the two
off-diagonal entries or the diagonal difference is nonzero.

Being scalar is recorded over a semiring; only the commutant computation itself, which divides by a
matrix entry, needs a field.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.mem_range_scalar_fin_two_iff`: a `2 × 2` matrix is scalar exactly when its off-diagonal
  entries vanish and its two diagonal entries agree.
* `EpsilonEridani.commute_fin_two_iff`: a matrix commutes with a non-scalar `2 × 2` matrix `M` exactly when
  it is of the form `a • 1 + b • M`.
* `EpsilonEridani.commute_of_commute_fin_two`: two matrices commuting with a common non-scalar `2 × 2`
  matrix commute with each other.
