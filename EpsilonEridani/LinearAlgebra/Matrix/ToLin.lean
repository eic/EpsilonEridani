# The endomorphism algebra of a finite-dimensional vector space, as matrices of a known size

Mathlib's `algEquivMatrix` turns `Module.End K M` into matrices indexed by the index type of a
chosen basis of `M`. This file records the form of it that is wanted when the *dimension* of `M` is
known but no particular basis is: for `Module.finrank K M = n`, an isomorphism

`Module.End K M ≃ₐ[K] Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) K`.

In the other direction it records how a matrix unit acts on the basis it is read in, which is the
computation every matrix model of a Lie algebra performs on its root vectors.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Algebra.endAlgEquivMatrix`: the above, read off the basis
  `Module.finBasisOfFinrankEq`.
* `EpsilonEridani.toLinAlgEquiv_single_apply_basis`: the endomorphism of a matrix unit sends a basis
  vector to a single coordinate.

The first is used to turn the Azumaya isomorphism of a finite-dimensional central simple algebra
into a matrix algebra in `EpsilonEridani/Algebra/CentralSimple/Opposite.lean`.

/-- A `K`-vector space `M` of dimension `n` has `Module.End K M ≃ₐ[K] Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) K`,
read off a chosen `K`-basis of `M`.

This is Mathlib's `algEquivMatrix` at the basis `Module.finBasisOfFinrankEq`, named here because it
is wanted wherever a finite-dimensional endomorphism algebra has to be turned into matrices of a
known size -- in particular as the second half of the opposite isomorphism
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.tensorOpAlgEquivMatrix`, which the roadmap asks for separately.

The basis is a choice, and nothing downstream should depend on which one it is; there is
deliberately no lemma computing the matrix entries. -/
