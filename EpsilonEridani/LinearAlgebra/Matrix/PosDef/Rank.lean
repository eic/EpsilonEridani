# Full-rank congruences of positive-definite matrices

For a rectangular matrix `B`, congruence sends a positive-definite matrix `A` to
`B * A * Bᴴ`.  The result is positive definite exactly when the rows of `B` are independent,
or equivalently when `B` has full row rank.  This file records those equivalences in the form
needed to transport positive-definite covariance matrices along surjective linear maps.

The real-transpose specialization is intended for covariance matrices, including the rectangular
congruences arising when finite-dimensional probability distributions are pushed forward along
surjective linear maps.

## Main results

* `Matrix.PosDef.mul_mul_conjTranspose_same_iff_vecMul_injective` characterizes when a rectangular
  congruence of a positive-definite matrix stays positive definite.
* `Matrix.PosDef.mul_mul_conjTranspose_same_iff_rank_eq_card` states the same criterion as full
  row rank.
* `Matrix.PosDef.mul_mul_transpose_same_iff_rank_eq_card` is the real-matrix form used for
  covariance matrices.
