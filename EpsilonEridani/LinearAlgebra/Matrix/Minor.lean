# Minors on a pair of rows and a pair of columns

A `2 × 2` minor of a matrix is the determinant of the submatrix on an ordered pair of rows and an
ordered pair of columns. `Matrix.pairMinor` names it, so that a family of such minors can be
indexed by pairs rather than by `Fin 2`-valued reindexing functions, and
`Matrix.pairMinor_mul` is the Cauchy--Binet expansion of a minor of a product, summing over the
increasing pairs of the middle index type.

The rows and the columns are indexed independently: a `2 × 2` minor makes sense for a rectangular
matrix, and the square case specializes.

The middle index type of Cauchy--Binet is linearly ordered, which is how the unordered pairs it
sums over are named without choosing representatives: each is written as the increasing one. The
sign of a minor depends on the order of its two indices, so some such choice is needed for the
statement to be sign-correct.

## Main definitions

* `Matrix.pairMinor`: the `2 × 2` minor on an ordered row pair and an ordered column pair.

## Main results

* `Matrix.pairMinor_eq`: the minor written out as a difference of two products, with
  `Matrix.pairMinor_self_left`, `Matrix.pairMinor_self_right`, `Matrix.pairMinor_swap_left`,
  `Matrix.pairMinor_swap_right` and `Matrix.pairMinor_transpose` for its behaviour under repeated
  indices, transposed pairs, and transposition.
* `Matrix.pairMinor_map`: a ring morphism carries a minor to the minor of the mapped
  matrix.
* `Matrix.pairMinor_mul`: Cauchy--Binet, expanding a minor of a product over the increasing pairs
  of the middle index type.
