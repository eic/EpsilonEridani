# The signature of a square matrix over a linearly ordered field

The *signature* of a square matrix `A` over a linearly ordered field is the difference between
the two indices of inertia of the quadratic form `x ↦ x ⬝ᵥ A *ᵥ x`, that is Mathlib's
`sigPos A.toQuadraticForm' - sigNeg A.toQuadraticForm'`. Only the symmetric part of `A` is
visible to that form, so the signature of `A` agrees with the signature of `A + Aᵀ`.

The three properties that make the signature computable are proved here: it is invariant under
congruence `A ↦ P * A * Pᵀ` by a matrix with unit determinant, it is additive along a block
diagonal, and on a diagonal matrix it counts the positive entries against the negative ones.
Together these evaluate the signature of any matrix diagonalised by an explicit congruence.

For an integral symmetric bilinear form presented as a lattice,
`EpsilonEridani.IntegralLattice.signature` records the finer triple `(n₊, n₀, n₋)`; the definition
here is the basis-level matrix counterpart, which is what a congruence class of matrices — such
as the S-equivalence class of a Seifert matrix — offers.

## Main definitions

* `Matrix.signature`: the difference of the two indices of inertia.

## Main results

* `Matrix.signature_congr`: invariance under congruence by a matrix with unit determinant.
* `Matrix.signature_submatrix_equiv_self`: invariance under an equivalence of the coordinate type.
* `Matrix.signature_fromBlocks_zero`: additivity along a block diagonal.
* `Matrix.signature_diagonal`: the signature of a diagonal matrix as a sum of signs.
* `Matrix.signature_hyperbolicGram`: the hyperbolic plane has signature zero.
* `Matrix.signature_eq_of_congr_diagonal`: the signature read off an explicit diagonalising
  congruence.
* `Matrix.signature_add_transpose`: the signature of `A + Aᵀ` is the signature of `A`.
* `Matrix.signature_smul_of_pos`: positive scaling does not change the signature.

/-- The signature of a square matrix over a linearly ordered field: the positive index of
inertia of the quadratic form `x ↦ x ⬝ᵥ A *ᵥ x` minus its negative index.

Only the symmetric part of `A` contributes, by `Matrix.signature_add_transpose`.

The quadratic form of a matrix does not depend on the decidability of equality on the index
type, so the local decider here is invisible: `Matrix.signature_def` identifies the definition
with the one read off any `DecidableEq ι` instance. Keeping it local leaves `DecidableEq` out
of the statements that do not mention `Matrix.toQuadraticForm'`, `Matrix.diagonal` or
`Matrix.det` themselves. -/
