# Rational canonical form in size two

A `2 × 2` matrix over a field is scalar or **cyclic**: as soon as it is not scalar some vector `v`
is not an eigenvector, and `v, M *ᵥ v` is then a basis in which `M` becomes the companion matrix
`!![0, -det M; 1, trace M]` of its characteristic polynomial `X² - (trace M) X + det M`. That is
the rational canonical form in size two, proved here at the level of matrices; the conjugacy
classification of `GL₂(F)` it yields is in
`EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.ConjugacyClasses`.

The second column of the conjugating equation is the Cayley-Hamilton identity
`M² = (trace M) • M - (det M) • 1` in disguise. In size two that identity is a four-entry
polynomial identity in the entries, so it is discharged by `ring` here rather than by invoking the
general theory.

Being scalar is spelled `M ∈ Set.range (Matrix.scalar (Fin 2))`, as in
`EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.Commute`, and unfolded by
`EpsilonEridani.mem_range_scalar_fin_two_iff`; that file's commutant computation is the companion result,
describing the centralizer of a non-scalar matrix rather than its normal form.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.companionFinTwo`: the companion matrix `!![0, -d; 1, t]` of `X² - t X + d`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_forall_mulVec_ne_smul`: a non-scalar `2 × 2` matrix has a cyclic vector.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_det_ne_zero_mul_eq_mul_companionFinTwo`: **rational canonical form in size two**,
  a non-scalar `2 × 2` matrix over a field is similar to the companion matrix of its characteristic
  polynomial.

/-- **Rational canonical form in size two.** A non-scalar `2 × 2` matrix `M` over a field is
similar to the companion matrix of its characteristic polynomial `X² - (trace M) X + det M`: in the
basis `v, M *ᵥ v` supplied by a cyclic vector `v` it *is* that companion matrix, the second column
of the identity being Cayley-Hamilton.

The conjugating matrix is produced together with its determinant rather than as an element of
`GL₂`, so that the statement also covers a matrix that is not itself invertible;
`EpsilonEridani.isConj_companionGL` is the group-level form. -/
