# A quadratic form forced by per-prime matrix congruences

Let `q` and `t` be integers, thought of as the size of the base field and the trace of Frobenius.
This file shows that an integer `D` is *forced* to equal the binary quadratic form
`q * r ^ 2 - t * (r * s) + s ^ 2` as soon as, for every prime `ℓ` other than one exceptional `p`,
`D` is realised modulo `ℓ` as the determinant of the pencil `r • M - s • 1` of some `2 × 2` matrix
`M` over `ZMod ℓ` with determinant `q` and trace `t`.

Nothing about elliptic curves appears here, and none is proved: the matrix data is a
**hypothesis** throughout. The intended instance — where `D` is the degree of `r π - s` for the
`q`-power Frobenius `π`, and `M` is its matrix on the `ℓ`-torsion — is what makes the conclusion
the Hasse quadratic form, but supplying that instance is the work of the Weil pairing and is not
done here.

Two forms of the hypothesis are provided, because a Weil pairing supplies determinants rather
than traces: one taking `M.trace = t` directly, and one taking `(1 - M).det = q + 1 - t`, from
which the trace is read off.

## Main results

* `eq_quadratic_form_of_det_trace`: from per-prime data with `det` and `trace`.
* `eq_quadratic_form_of_det_det_one_sub`: the same from `det` data alone.
When the realised integer is non-negative — as a degree is — non-negativity of the form follows
by rewriting, `eq_quadratic_form_of_det_trace h ▸ hD`; that is left to consumers rather than
exported as a corollary.

## Provenance

Ported from the AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (Apache-2.0), revision `513e83879e2f`, file
`HasseWeil/WeilPairing/Reduction.lean`, declarations `deg_eq_of_frobMatrix_data`,
`frob_det_congruence` and `deg_eq_of_frob_det_data`.

Three deviations. The source's fourth declaration, `qf_nonneg_of_frobMatrix_data`, is **not**
reproduced: it is a one-line `▸` transport of the equality theorem above it that repeats the whole
matrix-data interface to do so, which is why the Main results section above leaves that step to
consumers. The source's `det_smul_sub_smul_one_fin_two_of` takes `M.det = q` and
`M.trace = t` as hypotheses; EpsilonEridani already has the unconditional
`Matrix.det_smul_sub_smul_one_fin_two` (merged as #2328), so that lemma is used and the
hypotheses are substituted at the call site. And the source's `det_one_sub_fin_two` is not
reproduced: `(1 - M).det = 1 - M.trace + M.det` is a three-line computation, kept private here.
The names say what is concluded rather than naming the elliptic-curve instance, since no curve
occurs in any statement.
