# The identity forced by the character-lattice matrix of a special map

At the level of a root datum, a special isogeny is pinned by a square matrix `A` together with a
permutation `σ` of the root indices and a rescaling exponent `ℓ`, subject to the two equations

```text
A *ᵥ root i = ℓ i • root (σ i),    Aᵀ *ᵥ coroot (σ j) = ℓ j • coroot j
```

The Cartan-integer identity that these equations imply without using the root datum is collected
here once, so that the per-type files record only the tables and the equations themselves.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.mul_dotProduct_eq_of_mulVec_eq_smul`: the two displayed equations force the Cartan
  integers, computed as dot products, to transform by `ℓ i ⟨root (σ i), coroot (σ j)⟩ =
  ℓ j ⟨root i, coroot j⟩`.

## References

The lattice-level special-isogeny equations this lemma abstracts are those of R. Steinberg,
*Endomorphisms of Linear Algebraic Groups*, §11. The statement is the type-independent
core of the per-type files
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/SimplyConnectedRootDatum/B/SpecialMap.lean` and
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/SimplyConnectedRootDatum/G2/SpecialMap.lean`, where they were
first proved.

/-- **The Cartan integers transform by the rule the special-isogeny equations force.** If a matrix
`A` carries each member of a family `v` to a rescaled member, and its transpose carries the
correspondingly indexed member of a family `w` back with the same scalar, then the dot products of
the two families satisfy `ℓ i ⟨v (σ i), w (σ j)⟩ = ℓ j ⟨v i, w j⟩`. Applied to the roots and
coroots of a pinned root datum, this is the identity that separates a special isogeny from a
diagram automorphism, for which every `ℓ` is `1`. -/
