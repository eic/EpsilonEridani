# Connected algebraic actions on normal-subgroup joint weights

Let `H` be the coordinate ring of a connected affine group over a field `k`, acting linearly on a
finite-dimensional vector space. A normal subgroup of the base-valued point group determines a
finite set of characters with nonzero joint weight space, and the ambient point group permutes
those characters.

If this permutation action is represented by a coordinate bialgebra morphism to the corresponding
finite constant symmetric group, connectedness forces it to be trivial. Consequently every
nonzero joint weight space is preserved by every ambient point.

This isolates the connectedness half of the Lie--Kolchin induction. To apply it to a connected
solvable affine group, it remains to construct the coordinate morphism representing the
joint-weight permutation; the finiteness and pointwise action are already supplied by
`finiteIndex_ker_nonzeroJointWeightAction` and `nonzeroJointWeightAction`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.nonzeroJointWeightAction_eq_one_of_eq_pointHom`: a coordinate realization of the
  finite joint-weight action of a connected affine group is trivial.
* `EpsilonEridani.map_iInf_eigenspace_unitHom_eq_self_of_eq_pointHom`: every ambient point preserves
  each nonzero normal-subgroup joint weight space.

This advances the "Lie--Kolchin; solvable groups" milestone in Layer 5 of the ReductiveGroups
roadmap.
