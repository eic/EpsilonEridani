# Finiteness of the normal-subgroup joint-weight action

In a finite-dimensional representation, the characters of a normal subgroup with nonzero joint
weight space form a finite type by `finite_nonzeroJointWeights`. The ambient group therefore acts
on a finite set of nonzero joint weights, so the kernel of this permutation action has finite
index. Each element of that kernel preserves every nonzero joint weight space by
`map_iInf_eigenspace_unitHom_eq_self_of_mem_ker_nonzeroJointWeightAction`.

This is the finite-action bridge in the Lie--Kolchin argument. The remaining connectedness step is
to show that the ambient algebraic group acts trivially on this finite set.

## Main declarations

* `NonzeroJointWeight`: the characters whose joint weight space is nonzero.
* `finiteIndex_ker_nonzeroJointWeightAction`: for a normal subgroup, the kernel of the ambient
  permutation action on its nonzero joint weights has finite index.
