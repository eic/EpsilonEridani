# Doubling is invertible on a real vector space

For a real vector space `N`, multiplication by `2` is a bijection, so the doubling map is a unit
of the endomorphism ring — and it remains one when `N` is regarded only as a `ℤ`-module, where
`2` itself is not invertible. This file records that as an `Invertible (2 : Module.End ℤ N)`
instance, together with the rewrite rule identifying its inverse with the real scalar `(2 : ℝ)⁻¹`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.invertibleTwoModuleEndInt`: for any semiring `S` acting on `N` in which `2` is
  invertible, doubling is invertible on the `ℤ`-endomorphisms of `N`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.invOf_two_moduleEndInt_apply`: the inverse of doubling is halving by the scalar,
  for whichever `Invertible (2 : Module.End ℤ N)` instance is in scope.
* `EpsilonEridani.instInvertibleTwoModuleEndInt`: the instance for `S = ℝ`, so that doubling is
  invertible on any real vector space viewed as an endomorphism of its underlying `ℤ`-module.
* `EpsilonEridani.half_moduleEndInt_apply_eq_half_smul`: that inverse acts as the scalar `(2 : ℝ)⁻¹`.
  This is the `R = ℤ` counterpart of Mathlib's
  `QuadraticMap.half_moduleEnd_apply_eq_half_smul`, whose `Invertible (2 : R)` hypothesis is
  unavailable for `R = ℤ`; here the halving scalar comes from the module structure instead of
  from the ring.

## The consumer this exists for

Mathlib builds the bilinear map associated with a quadratic map by halving the polar form:
`QuadraticMap.associatedHom` is `⅟(2 : Module.End R N) • QuadraticMap.polarBilin`, with
`QuadraticMap.associated'` the `ℤ`-linear specialisation. Halving needs
`Invertible (2 : Module.End R N)`, and Mathlib's docstring for `associatedHom` names exactly the
case this file supplies:

> Note that this makes the bijection available in more cases than the simpler condition
> `Invertible (2 : R)`, e.g., when `R = ℤ` and `N = ℝ`.

Mathlib provides no instance reaching it: its only route is
`[Invertible (2 : R)] → Invertible (2 : Module.End R M)`, which for `R = ℤ` asks for
`Invertible (2 : ℤ)` and fails. With the instance below, `associated'` and its API —
`associated_apply`, `associated_isSymm`, `associated_flip`, `associated_eq_self_apply` — become
usable on `ℤ`-quadratic maps with values in a real vector space.

## Implementation notes

The construction is stated for a general scalar semiring `S` but is a `def` rather than an
`instance`, because `S` appears nowhere in the conclusion `Invertible (2 : Module.End ℤ N)` and
so could never be inferred by instance search. Instances are registered by applying it to the
scalar rings that are wanted; `ℝ` is the one this repository needs.
