# Vectors of bounded value for a positive definite integral quadratic form

A positive definite quadratic form on a finitely generated free `ℤ`-module takes each of its values
only finitely often: the sets `{x | q x ≤ n}` and `{x | q x = n}` are finite. This is the
finiteness that makes "the vectors of norm `n`" of a positive definite lattice a finite list, and
the one that turns an orbit lying in a level set into a periodic orbit.

## Main results

* `QuadraticMap.PosDef.finite_setOf_apply_le`: a positive definite quadratic form on a
  finitely generated free `ℤ`-module has only finitely many vectors of value at most `n`.
* `QuadraticMap.PosDef.finite_setOf_apply_eq`: consequently only finitely many vectors of
  value exactly `n`.

These results live in the root `QuadraticMap.PosDef` namespace so that they are available by dot
notation on a `QuadraticForm.PosDef` hypothesis.

## Implementation notes

The argument stays inside `ℤ`; no rational or real coefficients, no compactness, and no
diagonalization enter. Write `B` for the polar form, which is symmetric with `B x x = 2 * q x`,
hence nonnegative, and let `b` be a basis. The coordinates of `x` in the dual-like map
`T x = fun i ↦ B x (b i)` are bounded by Cauchy-Schwarz for a positive semidefinite symmetric form
(`LinearMap.BilinForm.apply_sq_le_of_symm`), since `(B x (b i)) ^ 2 ≤ B x x * B (b i) (b i)` and
the right-hand side is bounded once `q x` is. The map `T` is injective: a vector it kills is
orthogonal to a basis, hence to itself, hence isotropic, hence zero. So the set in question is the
preimage under an injective map of a box of integer vectors.

Note that `T` is *not* claimed to be surjective, and need not be: the polar form of a positive
definite integral quadratic form is generally not unimodular. Injectivity is all the argument
uses.
