# The discriminant of a regular real quadratic form

Over `ℝ` the square class of a nonzero number is its sign, so the discriminant of a regular form
only records the sign of the product of the weights of a diagonalization.  By Sylvester's law of
inertia that sign is `(-1)^q`, where `q = sigNeg Q` is the negative index of inertia.  This is the
determinant-sign formula `sign (det Q) = (-1)^q`, stated in the square-class group.

In particular the discriminant of a regular real form is determined by its signature, and it is
trivial exactly when the negative index is even.

## Main results

* `QuadraticForm.discr_formClass_eq_sigNeg_nsmul`: the discriminant of a regular real form is
  `sigNeg Q • [-1]`.
* `QuadraticForm.discr_formClass_eq_zero_iff_even_sigNeg`: it is trivial exactly when `sigNeg Q`
  is even.
* `EpsilonEridani.discr_formClass_realSignatureForm`: the normal form of signature `(p, q)` has
  discriminant `q • [-1]`.
