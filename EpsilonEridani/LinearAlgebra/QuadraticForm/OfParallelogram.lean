# A function satisfying the parallelogram law is a quadratic form

Let `M` and `N` be additive commutative groups, suppose doubling is injective on `N`,
and let `f : M → N` satisfy the **parallelogram law**

```
f (x + y) + f (x - y) = 2 • f x + 2 • f y.
```

Then `f` is a quadratic form: its polarisation `QuadraticMap.polar f x y = f (x + y) - f x - f y`
is biadditive, and `f (n • x) = n ^ 2 • f x`. This file proves that, and packages it as a
`QuadraticMap ℤ M N`. Both `f 0 = 0` and evenness of `f` come free from the law rather than being
assumed.

Mathlib has the converse direction — `QuadraticMap.polar_add_left` and friends read biadditivity
*off* a `QuadraticMap`, and `LinearMap.BilinMap.toQuadraticMap` builds one from a bilinear map —
but nothing in the other direction from the parallelogram law alone. Its `parallelogram_law` and
`parallelogram_law_with_norm` are statements about inner product spaces, and the Jordan–von Neumann
construction in `Analysis/InnerProductSpace/OfNorm.lean` recovers an inner product from a *norm* on
a real or complex space, using continuity. Neither applies to a function on a bare abelian group.

The elementary helpers need less: evenness holds without any condition on doubling, and
zero and evenness need only a left-cancellative additive monoid as target. Natural quadratic
scaling needs only a right-cancellative additive monoid as target, while integer scaling needs
an additive group. Both scaling results allow arbitrary additive groups as sources and assume
`f 0 = 0`. Thus scaling also applies to targets with `2`-torsion.

## The quadratic-map construction requires absence of `2`-torsion

`htwo : IsSMulRegular N 2` says that doubling is injective on `N`. It is sharp in both directions.

It is *not* `IsAddTorsionFree N`, which is strictly stronger and excludes codomains where the
conclusion holds: `IsSMulRegular (ZMod 3) 2` is true even though `ZMod 3` has `3`-torsion.

Nor can it be weakened away. With `M = N = ZMod 2` *every* function satisfies the parallelogram
law, because `x - y = x + y` and `2 • z = 0` there; the constant function `1` is then one that
satisfies it while failing even `f 0 = 0`, which every quadratic form obeys — and correspondingly
`¬ IsSMulRegular (ZMod 2) 2`. Even assuming `f 0 = 0` is insufficient for biadditivity:
on `(ZMod 2)³`, the function `f(x) = x₁x₂x₃` satisfies the law and preserves zero, but violates
the three-variable identity at the three standard basis vectors.

For a torsion-free codomain it is one term: `smul_right_injective N two_ne_zero` supplies it for
`N = ℝ`, the canonical height's target, and for `N = ℤ`, the degree form's.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.QuadraticMap.map_zero_of_parallelogram`: `f 0 = 0` when doubling is injective.
* `EpsilonEridani.QuadraticMap.map_neg_of_parallelogram`: `f (-x) = f x`.
* `EpsilonEridani.QuadraticMap.map_add_add_add_map_of_parallelogram`: the three-variable identity
  `f (x + y + z) + (f x + f y + f z) = f (x + y) + f (y + z) + f (z + x)`, stated exactly as
  `QuadraticMap.map_add_add_add_map`.
* `EpsilonEridani.QuadraticMap.polar_add_left_of_parallelogram` and
  `polar_zsmul_left_of_parallelogram`: the polarisation is additive and `ℤ`-linear on the left.
* `EpsilonEridani.QuadraticMap.map_nsmul_of_parallelogram`: `f (n • x) = n ^ 2 • f x` for `n : ℕ`,
  assuming `f 0 = 0`, for an additive group `M` and right-cancellative additive monoid `N`.
* `EpsilonEridani.QuadraticMap.map_zsmul_of_parallelogram`: `f (n • x) = n ^ 2 • f x` for `n : ℤ`,
  assuming `f 0 = 0`, without commutativity of either group or injectivity of doubling on `N`.
* `EpsilonEridani.QuadraticMap.ofParallelogram`: `f` as a `QuadraticMap ℤ M N`, with the polarisation as
  its companion bilinear map.

## Where this is used

Two constructions in arithmetic geometry arrive at a function *known to satisfy the parallelogram
law* and want it as a quadratic form.

The canonical height of an elliptic curve is one. It satisfies the parallelogram law exactly, and
its polarisation is the Néron–Tate height pairing **up to a factor of two**: by
`QuadraticMap.polar_self` the polarisation here has `polar f x x = 2 • f x`, whereas the pairing
whose Gram determinant on a basis of the free part of the Mordell–Weil group is the regulator is
normalised so that `⟨P, P⟩` is the height itself. A consumer wanting the regulator convention
halves this one; the choice is not made here, since halving is not available in a general abelian
group.

The degree form on `End E` is the other: its polarisation is the trace form, and non-negativity of
the degree gives the Hasse bound by Cauchy–Schwarz (Silverman, *The Arithmetic of Elliptic
Curves*, V.1.2).

Both take values in a torsion-free group — `ℝ` and `ℤ` respectively — so both satisfy the
hypothesis below with room to spare. Stated for a general abelian group so that neither carries
its own copy.
