# Conjugating automorphism groups along a semilinear equivalence

Mathlib conjugates general linear groups with
`LinearMap.GeneralLinearGroup.congrLinearEquiv : GL R₁ M₁ ≃* GL R₂ M₂`, and identifies `GL R M` with
the automorphisms `M ≃ₗ[R] M` through `LinearMap.GeneralLinearGroup.generalLinearEquiv`. Groups of
linear automorphisms cut out by a structure they preserve — an orthogonal group, an isometry
group — are subgroups of `M ≃ₗ[R] M` rather than of `GL R M`, so what they need is the composite of
those two, which this file records as `LinearEquiv.autCongr`.

Conjugation needs no more than a semilinear equivalence, which is the generality
`congrLinearEquiv` already supplies: `e : M₁ ≃ₛₗ[σ₁₂] M₂` carries `R₁`-automorphisms of `M₁` to
`R₂`-automorphisms of `M₂`, the scalars travelling along `σ₁₂`. The two inverse-pair assumptions
give a round trip on each scalar ring — `σ₂₁ ∘ σ₁₂` is the identity on `R₁` and `σ₁₂ ∘ σ₂₁` the
identity on `R₂` — and it is the latter that makes the conjugate `R₂`-linear.

## Main definitions

* `LinearEquiv.autCongr`: conjugation by `e : M₁ ≃ₛₗ[σ₁₂] M₂`, as an isomorphism
  `(M₁ ≃ₗ[R₁] M₁) ≃* (M₂ ≃ₗ[R₂] M₂)`.

## Main statements

* `LinearEquiv.autCongr_apply` and `LinearEquiv.autCongr_symm_apply`: conjugation and its inverse
  as equalities of linear equivalences, for consumers that read the conjugate as a map rather than
  at a point. The pointwise `autCongr_apply_apply` and `autCongr_symm_apply_apply` are the same
  facts evaluated at `m`.
