# Freeness and dimension of an exterior algebra

Mathlib records the graded pieces of an exterior algebra in full: `exteriorPower.instFree` says
that `⋀[R]^n M` is free when `M` is, and `exteriorPower.finrank_eq` computes its rank as
`(finrank R M).choose n`. It also builds the basis `Module.Basis.ExteriorAlgebra` of the whole
algebra, indexed by the *finite subsets* of the index set of a basis of `M`. What it does not
record is the consequence: `ExteriorAlgebra R M` is itself a free module, of rank `2 ^ finrank R M`
when `M` is finite free.

This file supplies that. Nothing here is new mathematics — the basis does all the work, and the
rank count is `Fintype.card_finset`, the observation that a finite set with `n` elements has `2 ^ n`
subsets, which is the same `∑ₖ (n choose k) = 2 ^ n` that summing `exteriorPower.finrank_eq` over
the graded pieces would give. The point is to have the statement, because it is what the dimension
count for a Clifford algebra rests on: over a ring in which `2` is invertible,
`CliffordAlgebra.equivExterior` identifies `CliffordAlgebra Q` with `ExteriorAlgebra R M` as a
module, so every rank statement about the Clifford algebra is a rank statement about the exterior
algebra transported along that isomorphism. See
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/CliffordAlgebra/Dimension.lean`.

The hypotheses are the weakest the basis needs: a commutative ring `R` and a free `R`-module `M`,
with no invertibility of `2` anywhere, since the exterior algebra has a basis over any commutative
ring.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ExteriorAlgebra.instFree`: the exterior algebra of a free module is free.
* `EpsilonEridani.ExteriorAlgebra.instFinite`: the exterior algebra of a finite free module is a finite
  module.
* `EpsilonEridani.ExteriorAlgebra.finrank_eq_two_pow`: `finrank R (ExteriorAlgebra R M) = 2 ^ finrank R M`.
