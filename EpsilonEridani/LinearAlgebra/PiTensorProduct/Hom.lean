# The tensor product of hom modules is the hom module of the tensor products

Mathlib's `PiTensorProduct.piTensorHomMap` is the canonical comparison map

`⨂ᵢ (Mᵢ →ₗ Nᵢ) → (⨂ᵢ Mᵢ →ₗ ⨂ᵢ Nᵢ)`,  `⨂ᵢ fᵢ ↦ ⨂ᵢ mᵢ ↦ ⨂ᵢ fᵢ mᵢ`,

defined for arbitrary families of modules over a commutative semiring. This file proves that it is
**bijective** as soon as the index type is finite and every `Mᵢ` and every `Nᵢ` is finite free, and
packages the result as the linear equivalence `PiTensorProduct.piTensorHomEquiv`.

The proof is the basis computation. If `bᵢ` is a basis of `Mᵢ` indexed by `κᵢ` and `cᵢ` a basis of
`Nᵢ` indexed by `νᵢ`, then `Module.Basis.linearMap` gives the matrix-unit basis of `Mᵢ →ₗ Nᵢ`
indexed by `νᵢ × κᵢ`, and `Module.Basis.piTensorProduct` turns a family of bases into a basis of a
tensor product. The comparison map carries the tensor of the matrix-unit bases to the matrix-unit
basis of `⨂ᵢ Mᵢ →ₗ ⨂ᵢ Nᵢ` built from the two tensored bases, along the regrouping
`(∀ i, νᵢ × κᵢ) ≃ (∀ i, νᵢ) × (∀ i, κᵢ)`; a linear map taking a basis bijectively to a basis is an
isomorphism. Finiteness of the index type and of each basis is what gives the two sides matching
bases at all, and it is used nowhere else.

Taking `Nᵢ = Mᵢ` this identifies `End (⨂ᵢ Mᵢ)` with `⨂ᵢ End Mᵢ`, compatibly with composition
(`PiTensorProduct.piTensorHomEquiv_tprod_comp_tprod`). That identification is the shape in which the
commutant computations of Schur-Weyl duality are run: the endomorphisms of a tensor power commuting
with the permutations of the factors are the invariants of the permutation action on the tensor
power of the endomorphism algebra.

## Main definitions

* `PiTensorProduct.piTensorHomEquiv`: the comparison map as a linear equivalence, for a finite
  index type and finite free modules.

## Main results

* `PiTensorProduct.piTensorHomMap_bijective_of_basis`: bijectivity of the comparison map from a
  family of finite bases, the engine of the file.
* `PiTensorProduct.piTensorHomMap_bijective`: bijectivity in the finite free formulation.
* `PiTensorProduct.piTensorHomEquiv_tprod_comp_tprod`: the equivalence turns the factorwise
  composition of two pure tensors of endomorphisms into the composition of their images.

  Layer 8, "The double centralizer (image-level)". The commutant of the symmetric-group image in
  `End (V^{⊗n})` is computed by transporting it through this isomorphism to the invariants of the
  permutation action on `(End V)^{⊗n}`; the invariants are supplied by
  `EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Symmetric/TensorAction/Invariants.lean`, which names this
  isomorphism as the comparison it is missing.
