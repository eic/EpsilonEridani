# The trace of an endomorphism of a tensor square

A tensor square carries a basis indexed by *pairs* of indices of a basis of the underlying module,
and the two tensor squares in the library — the binary `M ⊗[R] M` and the `Fin 2`-indexed
`⨂[R]^2 M` — differ only in how that pair index is spelled. This file isolates the computation
they share: an endomorphism of the square whose diagonal entry at the pair `(i, j)` is `aᵢⱼ aⱼᵢ`,
where `a` is the matrix of an endomorphism `f` of the module, has trace `tr (f ∘ f)`, because
summing `aᵢⱼ aⱼᵢ` over all pairs is the trace of `a * a`.

The endomorphism the two callers feed in is `f ⊗ f` composed with the flip of the two factors, but
nothing here knows that: the input is the diagonal of the matrix, so the statement is about an
arbitrary finite basis whose index type is equivalent to a pair type, and the two callers supply
their own basis and their own diagonal computation.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.trace_eq_trace_comp_self_of_toMatrix_diag`: an endomorphism with diagonal entries
  `aᵢⱼ aⱼᵢ` in a pair-indexed basis has trace `tr (f ∘ f)`.

/-- **An endomorphism whose diagonal entries are `aᵢⱼ aⱼᵢ` has trace `tr (f ∘ f)`.** Here `a` is
the matrix of `f` in the basis `b`, and the diagonal is read in a basis `B` whose index type is
equivalent, through `e`, to pairs of indices of `b`; summing `aᵢⱼ aⱼᵢ` over all pairs is the trace
of `a * a`, which is the trace of `f ∘ f`. -/
