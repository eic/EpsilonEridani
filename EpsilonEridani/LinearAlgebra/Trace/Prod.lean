# Block upper triangular endomorphisms of a product

An endomorphism `F` of `A × C` that preserves the first summand, acting there as `fA`, and covers
`fC` on the second is *block upper triangular*: its only off-diagonal block is the `C → A` map
`fst ∘ F ∘ inr`. This file records that normal form and the resulting trace identity.

## Main results

* `LinearMap.eq_prodMap_add_inl_comp_snd` — the normal form, over an arbitrary semiring.
* `LinearMap.trace_prodMap_add_inl_comp_snd` — the trace of a block upper triangular endomorphism
  is the sum of the traces of its diagonal blocks.

The trace identity needs free finite modules over a commutative ring, since that is what Mathlib's
`LinearMap.trace_prodMap'` and `LinearMap.trace_comp_comm'` require; the normal form itself needs
neither commutativity, finiteness, nor additive inverses.

/-- The trace of a block upper triangular endomorphism of `A × C` is the sum of the traces of its
diagonal blocks: the off-diagonal `C → A` block composes to zero the other way round, so
`LinearMap.trace_comp_comm'` makes its contribution vanish. -/
