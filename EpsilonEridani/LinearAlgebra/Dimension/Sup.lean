# Two submodules meeting in zero inside a third

Mathlib's `Submodule.finrank_add_finrank_le_of_disjoint` bounds the dimensions of two disjoint
submodules by the dimension of the *ambient* module. `EpsilonEridani.finrank_add_finrank_le_of_inf_eq_bot`
is the relative form: the bound holds inside any submodule containing them both, which is what a
counting argument that produces its two subspaces inside a third one needs.

The lemma is stated for an abstract module `W`, and every call site supplies `W` explicitly.
Leaving `W` to unification makes the elaborator look for an `AddCommGroup` structure on a space --
of linear maps, of tensors -- whose `AddCommMonoid` structure is already fixed, which it does not
find quickly.
