# Generators of a quadratic extension

Mathlib's `Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension K L` records that `L/K` has degree two but says nothing
about the elements realising that degree. This file first supplies a non-scalar element, then
shows how to *choose* and *change* a generator when the base is a field:

`Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension.exists_notMem_range_algebraMap`: an element outside the image of
the base exists. Over a field base, the coordinate theorem below makes any such element a
generator.
`Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension.exists_eq_algebraMap_add_algebraMap_mul`: every element is `b + aθ`
for a fixed generator `θ`, the coordinate presentation over the basis `1, θ` (used by the
quadratic field-norm computation).
`Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension.exists_ne_zero_eq_algebraMap_add_algebraMap_mul`: for a *second*
generator the `θ`-coefficient is nonzero, so any two generators differ by `θ' = b + aθ` with
`a ≠ 0` and a statement proved for one transfers to every other.
`EpsilonEridani.linearIndependent_one_of_notMem_range_algebraMap` is the linear-algebra step behind them.

None asks for a field on `L`: each theorem needs only a semiring, with the ring structure required
by linear independence obtained locally through `Algebra.semiringToRing`. Non-scalar existence is
stated over the commutative semirings admitted by Mathlib's `IsQuadraticExtension`; the strong rank
condition also forces the base to be nontrivial. The coordinate results require a field base:
over `ℤ`, the element `(0, 2)` lies outside the diagonal copy of `ℤ` in `ℤ × ℤ` but does not span
the algebra together with `1`. Over a field, the results cover split and non-reduced quadratic
algebras such as `K × K` and `K[X]/(X²)`.

These are used by the extension quadratic twist in
`EpsilonEridani/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/QuadraticTwist.lean` and by the quadratic field-norm
computation in `EpsilonEridani/NumberTheory/NumberField/Quadratic/Norm.lean`.

`Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension` itself, already in Mathlib — is not needed.

/-- A quadratic algebra contains an element outside the image of the base ring. Were every
element in the image of `algebraMap`, the algebra would have rank one, contradicting
`finrank = 2`. The base `K` needs to be a commutative semiring with the strong rank condition,
and `L` a semiring. The strong rank condition forces `K` to be nontrivial; the quadratic-extension
hypothesis makes `L` free of rank `2`, and the faithful scalar action makes `algebraMap`
injective. -/

/-- `1` and any element lying outside the base field are linearly independent over the base
field. The ambient algebra needs only a semiring structure: its field-algebra structure supplies
a ring structure, and the hypothesis on `θ` implies that the algebra is nontrivial. -/

/-- **Every element of a quadratic extension is `b + aθ`** for a fixed generator `θ`: the basis
`1, θ` spans `L` over `K`. The `θ`-coefficient may vanish, exactly when the element lies in the
base field; `exists_ne_zero_eq_algebraMap_add_algebraMap_mul` records that it does not for a second
generator. The spanning is `K`-linear algebra, so this needs only a *semiring* on `L`. -/
