# Descending a span from a ring of scalars to `ℤ`

Let `b` be a family in an `A`-module `M` that is linearly independent over the ring `A`, let `L` be
the lattice of integer combinations of `b`, and let `V ≤ L` be a sublattice. Enlarging the
coefficients of `V` from `ℤ` to `A` can only add elements outside `L`, provided `ℤ · 1` is a direct
summand of `A`, that is, provided some additive map `t : A → ℤ` has `t 1 = 1`:
`Submodule.span A V ∩ L = V` (`EpsilonEridani.mem_of_mem_span_of_mem_closure`).

The map `t` is applied to coordinates: on the `A`-span of `b` it sends `∑ aᵢ bᵢ` to `∑ t(aᵢ) bᵢ`;
this fixes `L` pointwise and carries `a • v` to `t(a) • v` for `v ∈ L`. Without such a retraction
the conclusion fails, as `A = ℤ[1/2]`, `V = 2L` shows.

The standard source of a retraction is a power basis: the coordinate along `gen ^ 0 = 1` is one
(`PowerBasis.exists_linearMap_apply_one`). In particular it applies to `A = ℤ[ζ]` for a root of
unity `ζ` in a field of characteristic zero, through `Algebra.adjoin.powerBasis'`. This is the
descent step in Brauer's induction theorem, where a virtual character is first written as a
combination of induced characters with coefficients in `ℤ[ζ]`.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.mem_of_mem_span_of_mem_closure`: an integer combination of `b` that is an
  `A`-combination of elements of `V` is already in `V`.

## References

* J.-P. Serre, *Linear Representations of Finite Groups*, Springer GTM 42 (1977), Chapter 10, in
  the proof of Theorem 18, where the case `A = ℤ[ζ]` is argued with a `ℤ`-basis of `A`
  containing `1`.

/-- **Descent of a span from `A` to `ℤ`.** Let `b` be linearly independent over `A`, and let
`t : A → ℤ` be additive with `t 1 = 1`. If `V` is an additive subgroup of the integer combinations
of `b`, then an integer combination of `b` lying in the `A`-span of `V` already lies in `V`. -/
