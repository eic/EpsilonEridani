# Diagonalization of symmetric bilinear forms in every characteristic

Over a field in which `2` is invertible, every symmetric bilinear form on a finite-dimensional
space has an orthogonal basis (`LinearMap.BilinForm.exists_orthogonal_basis`). In characteristic
two this fails: a nonzero alternating form is symmetric, and an orthogonal basis for it would make
every basis pairing vanish, hence the whole form. This file shows that the alternating forms are
the only obstruction, in every characteristic: a symmetric form has an orthogonal basis if and
only if it is zero or not alternating (`LinearMap.BilinForm.IsSymm.exists_orthogonal_basis_iff`).

For a nondegenerate form over a field in which every element is a square, for instance a finite
field of characteristic two (`isSquare_of_charTwo'`), the orthogonal basis can be rescaled: a
symmetric form that is not alternating has an **orthonormal basis**, one in which its matrix is
the identity (`LinearMap.BilinForm.IsSymm.exists_basis_toMatrix_eq_one`). Hence it is equivalent
to the standard form `Matrix.toBilin' 1`, which is itself such a form in every positive dimension
(`Matrix.isAlt_toBilin'_one_iff` in `EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.BilinearForm`), and any two such
forms of the same dimension are equivalent. Together with the symplectic normal form of
`EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.BilinearForm.SymplecticBasis` this gives the dichotomy for nondegenerate
forms that are alternating or symmetric: a symplectic basis when the form is alternating, an
orthonormal basis when it is not
(`LinearMap.BilinForm.Nondegenerate.exists_basis_toMatrix_eq_J_or_toMatrix_eq_one`). Over `𝔽₂`,
where every form that is alternating is symmetric, this classifies the nondegenerate symmetric
bilinear forms, which is the input to the normal forms of one-relator pro-`2` groups.

## Main results

* `LinearMap.BilinForm.IsSymm.exists_orthogonal_basis_of_isAlt_imp_eq_zero`: a symmetric form
  that is zero or not alternating has an orthogonal basis, in every characteristic.
* `LinearMap.BilinForm.IsSymm.exists_orthogonal_basis_iff`: this condition is also necessary.
* `LinearMap.BilinForm.IsSymm.exists_basis_toMatrix_eq_one`: over a field in which every element
  is a square, a nondegenerate symmetric form that is not alternating has an orthonormal basis.
* `LinearMap.BilinForm.IsSymm.equivalent_toBilin'_one`,
  `LinearMap.BilinForm.IsSymm.equivalent_of_finrank_eq`: such a form is equivalent to the standard
  form on `Fin n → K`, so any two of them of the same dimension are equivalent.
* `LinearMap.BilinForm.Nondegenerate.exists_basis_toMatrix_eq_J_or_toMatrix_eq_one`: the
  symplectic-or-orthonormal dichotomy.

complement of `x` is alternating and nonzero, then some non-isotropic vector has an orthogonal
complement on which `B` is not alternating: given `u, w` orthogonal to `x` with `B u w ≠ 0`, the
