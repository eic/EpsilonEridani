# Products of bilinear forms

The product of two bilinear forms is the block-diagonal form on the product module: each factor
carries its own form and the two factors are orthogonal to each other. It is the bilinear
counterpart of `QuadraticMap.prod`, and it is the form an orthogonal direct sum of bilinear
modules carries.

Nondegeneracy is componentwise: a vector is in the radical of the product exactly when both of
its components are in the radicals of the factors.

## Main declarations

* `LinearMap.BilinForm.prod`: the block-diagonal form on a product module.
* `LinearMap.BilinForm.nondegenerate_prod_iff`: the product form is nondegenerate exactly when
  both factors are.
