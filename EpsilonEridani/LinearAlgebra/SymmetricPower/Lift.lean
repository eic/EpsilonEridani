# The universal property of the symmetric tensor power

A multilinear map `f : Mⁱ → N` that is unchanged by permuting its arguments factors uniquely
through the symmetric tensor power. This file builds that factorization,
`SymmetricPower.lift`, as the descent of `PiTensorProduct.lift f` through the quotient map
`SymmetricPower.mk`: the defining relation of the quotient identifies a pure tensor with each of
its reorderings, and `f` takes the same value on all of them.

Together with `SymmetricPower.ext`, which says that a linear map out of the symmetric power is
determined by its values on pure symmetric tensors, this says that composing with the pure
symmetric tensor `⨂ₛ` is a bijection from the linear maps `Sym[R] ι M →ₗ[R] N` onto the
permutation-invariant multilinear maps `Mⁱ → N`, for every `N`.

## Main definitions

* `SymmetricPower.lift`: the linear map on the symmetric power induced by a permutation-invariant
  multilinear map.

## Main results

* `SymmetricPower.lift_tprod`: `lift f` agrees with `f` on pure symmetric tensors.
* `SymmetricPower.ext`: linear maps out of a symmetric power agreeing on pure symmetric
  tensors are equal.
