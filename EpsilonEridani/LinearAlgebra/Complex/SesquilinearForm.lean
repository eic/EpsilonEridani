# Balancing a sesquilinear form against a conjugate-semilinear map, and separation

A sesquilinear form `H` on a module and a `star`-semilinear map `K` of that module are unrelated
data.  This file makes them compatible: the **balanced** form

`balance H K x y = H x y + star (H (K x) (K y))`

is again sesquilinear -- each argument of the second summand picks up a conjugation from `K`, and
the outer conjugation restores the shape -- and it satisfies

`balance H K (K x) (K y) = star (balance H K x y)`

as soon as `K ∘ K` is a scalar of modulus one, which an arbitrary `H` need not.  That is the
only property balancing adds: being Hermitian, nonnegative, and definite off the origin all pass
from `H` to `balance H K` unchanged.

The construction and its compatibility are plain star-ring algebra, so they are stated over a
commutative star semiring.  Nonnegativity and definiteness off the origin need an order on the
scalars and are stated over `ℂ`, which is why the file sits here: the complex half is what the
representation theory of `EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/InvariantForm/StructureMap.lean` consumes.

Definiteness off the origin is also what makes a form **separate** vectors: two vectors pairing
identically against every vector are equal, because their difference pairs to zero with itself.
That principle is what the representation theory downstream uses to identify two vectors, and it
is recorded here beside the construction; it needs subtraction, hence a commutative star *ring*.

## Main definitions

* `LinearMap.balance`: the balanced form `x, y ↦ H x y + star (H (K x) (K y))`.

## Main results

* `LinearMap.balance_apply`: the defining formula of the balanced form.
* `LinearMap.balance_map_map`: the balanced form is compatible with the map it was balanced
  against, once that map squares to a scalar of modulus one.
* `LinearMap.isSymm_balance`, `LinearMap.isNonneg_balance` and
  `LinearMap.balance_apply_self_ne_zero`: balancing preserves Hermitian symmetry, nonnegativity,
  and definiteness off the origin.
* `LinearMap.eq_of_forall_sesq_eq`: a form definite off the origin separates vectors.

/-- The **balanced** form of a sesquilinear form `H` against a `star`-semilinear map `K`:
`x, y ↦ H x y + star (H (K x) (K y))`.  Each argument of the second summand picks up a conjugation
from `K`, and the outer conjugation restores the shape of a sesquilinear form, conjugate-linear in
the first argument and linear in the second.  Adding it to `H` is what forces the compatibility
`balance H K (K x) (K y) = star (balance H K x y)` whenever `K ∘ K` is a scalar of modulus
one. -/

/-- **The balanced form is compatible with the map it was balanced against**: replacing both
arguments by their `K`-images conjugates the value, as soon as `K ∘ K` is a scalar `ε` of modulus
one.  The conjugation of the first argument of `H` turns the two `ε`-factors into `star ε * ε`, so
no more than `star ε * ε = 1` is used; the real signs `ε = 1` and `ε = -1` -- an involution, or a
quaternionic structure -- are the cases the representation theory needs.  This is the only property
of `balance` that `H` alone does not already have, and the whole point of the construction. -/
