# Laurent functions on a split torus

The characters of the split torus `𝔾ₘ^κ` span a subalgebra of the `R`-valued functions on its
points, the **Laurent functions** `EpsilonEridani.laurentFunctions R κ`: over a field these are exactly
the functions given by a Laurent polynomial in the coordinates. This file builds that subalgebra
and proves that the characters spanning it are linearly independent.

Independence is what makes the construction useful. Distinct characters of a monoid with values in
a domain are linearly independent (Artin), so `EpsilonEridani.linearIndependent_weightCharHom` turns an
identity between two Laurent expansions into an identity between their coefficients. This is the
mechanism by which a weight is read off an expansion, and it is why the weight spaces of a
rational representation of `GL n k` are what they are; the restriction of a rational function to
the diagonal torus, which is where that argument starts, is in
`EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.LaurentFunctions`.

The value ring is a commutative ring throughout, except where separating characters forces an
infinite field: over `𝔽₂` the torus has a single point and all characters coincide.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.weightCharHom`: a character of the split torus, with values read in `R` rather than in
  `Rˣ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.laurentFunctions`: the subalgebra of functions on the torus spanned by the characters.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.linearIndependent_weightCharHom`: over an infinite field the characters of the split
  torus are linearly independent, so a Laurent expansion determines its coefficients.
