# The vectors and the scalars inside a Clifford algebra

The generators of a Clifford algebra are the elements `ι Q m`, and the first thing one wants to
know about them is that they are a faithful copy of `M`: that `ι Q` is injective, so that `M` is
*the* module of vectors `LinearMap.range (ι Q)` sitting inside `CliffordAlgebra Q`, and that no
nonzero vector is a scalar.

Mathlib proves all of this for the exterior algebra, which is the Clifford algebra of the zero
form (`ExteriorAlgebra.ι_leftInverse`, `ExteriorAlgebra.ι_inj`,
`ExteriorAlgebra.ι_eq_algebraMap_iff`, `ExteriorAlgebra.ι_range_disjoint_one`), using the
square-zero extension `TrivSqZeroExt R M` as an auxiliary algebra. That trick is unavailable for a
general `Q`: in `TrivSqZeroExt R M` the square of a vector is `0`, so it computes `Q = 0` and
nothing else. What is available instead is Mathlib's module isomorphism
`CliffordAlgebra.equivExterior Q : CliffordAlgebra Q ≃ₗ[R] ExteriorAlgebra R M`, valid whenever
`2` is invertible, which sends generators to generators and scalars to scalars. This file
transports the exterior-algebra statements along it, so all of them hold for an arbitrary
quadratic form over a commutative ring in which `2` is invertible; no hypothesis on `Q` — no
nondegeneracy, no finiteness, no freeness — is needed.

The payoff is `CliffordAlgebra.ιRangeEquiv`, the linear equivalence `M ≃ₗ[R] range (ι Q)`.
It is what turns a statement about elements of `CliffordAlgebra Q` that happen to lie in
`range (ι Q)` into a statement about vectors of `M`: Mathlib's twisted conjugation lemmas
(`lipschitzGroup.conjAct_smul_range_ι`, `spinGroup.involute_act_ι_mem_range_ι`) say only that the
Lipschitz and spin groups act on `range (ι Q)`, and it is `ιRangeEquiv` that transports such an
action to an honest linear automorphism of `M`. Landing in the orthogonal group of `Q` is a
further step: a linear automorphism is not orthogonal for free, and that the transported action
preserves `Q` has to be proved separately.

Against the degree filtration `CliffordAlgebra.filtration`, whose first step is spanned by
the scalars and the vectors, the disjointness of the two pins that step down to `R ⊕ M`:
`CliffordAlgebra.filtrationOneEquiv`.

## Main definitions

* `CliffordAlgebra.ιInv`: the linear left inverse of `ι Q`, the *vector part* of an
  element of the Clifford algebra.
* `CliffordAlgebra.ιRangeEquiv`: the vector equivalence `M ≃ₗ[R] range (ι Q)`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.scalarAddVector` and
  `CliffordAlgebra.filtrationOneEquiv`: the map `(r, m) ↦ r + ι Q m` out of `R × M`, and
  the equivalence with the first step of the degree filtration that it induces.

## Main results

* `CliffordAlgebra.ι_injective`, `CliffordAlgebra.ι_inj` and
  `CliffordAlgebra.ι_eq_zero_iff`: the generators are a faithful copy of `M`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.ι_eq_algebraMap_iff`, `CliffordAlgebra.ι_ne_one` and
  `CliffordAlgebra.ι_range_disjoint_one`: a vector is a scalar only when both vanish.
* `CliffordAlgebra.mem_range_ι_iff`: membership of `range (ι Q)` is detected by the vector
  part.
* `CliffordAlgebra.finrank_filtration_one`: the first step of the degree filtration has one
  more dimension than `M`.

/-! ### The comparison with the exterior algebra

Mathlib's `CliffordAlgebra.equivExterior` is only a linear equivalence. Its scalar equation is
recorded in the general Clifford-algebra API; here we record the generator equation needed for
the vector API. Both are immediate from its definition as a `changeForm`. -/

/-- `CliffordAlgebra.equivExterior` sends a generator to the corresponding generator of the
exterior algebra. -/
theorem equivExterior_ι (m : M) : equivExterior Q (ι Q m) = ExteriorAlgebra.ι R m :=
  changeForm_ι changeForm.associated_neg_proof m

/-! ### The vector part -/

/-- The vector part of an element of a Clifford algebra: a linear left inverse of `ι Q`.

This is `ExteriorAlgebra.ιInv` transported along `CliffordAlgebra.equivExterior`, which is where
the hypothesis `[Invertible (2 : R)]` comes from; the square-zero extension that builds
`ExteriorAlgebra.ιInv` directly sees only the zero quadratic form. -/

theorem ι_leftInverse : Function.LeftInverse (ιInv Q) (ι Q) := ιInv_ι Q

/-- The vector part of a scalar vanishes.

The exterior-algebra half of the argument is that `ExteriorAlgebra.map 0` fixes scalars while it
kills vector parts (`ExteriorAlgebra.ιInv_comp_map`). -/

/-- **The generators of a Clifford algebra are a faithful copy of `M`.** When `2` is invertible
this needs no hypothesis on `Q`. -/

/-- **The vectors of a Clifford algebra are disjoint from its scalars.** Together with
`EpsilonEridani.Algebra.wordFiltration_one`, which writes the first step of the degree filtration as
`1 ⊔ LinearMap.range (ι Q)`, this is what makes that step a direct sum of `R` and `M`; see
`CliffordAlgebra.filtrationOneEquiv`. -/

/-! ### The vector equivalence -/

/-- **The vector equivalence**: `M` is the module of vectors `LinearMap.range (ι Q)` inside its
Clifford algebra.

Mathlib's twisted-conjugation lemmas say that the Lipschitz and spin groups act on
`LinearMap.range (ι Q)`; this equivalence is what transports such an action to a linear
automorphism of `M`. It says nothing about `Q`: to place that automorphism in the orthogonal
group one still has to prove that it preserves `Q`. -/
