# Contraction against the `ℤ/2`-grading

Mathlib's `CliffordAlgebra.contractLeft` lowers the degree of a multivector by one, so it
exchanges the two halves of the `ℤ/2`-grading. Mathlib records neither half of that sentence:
`involute` interacts with products (`involute` is an algebra homomorphism) and with the grading,
but never with a contraction, and `evenOdd` is never related to `contractLeft` at all.

This file proves both. That a contraction carries `evenOdd Q i` into `evenOdd Q (i + 1)` is the
grading statement itself, and it is what makes an annihilation operator odd; anticommutation with
the grade involution is its operator shadow, and is what makes the grade involution usable as an
*even* operator alongside exterior multiplication and contraction — for instance because an
anisotropic vector orthogonal to a polarization acts on a spinor module by its scalar coordinate
times the grade involution.

The degree bookkeeping is in `ZMod 2`, where lowering and raising the degree by one are the same
map, so `evenOdd Q (i + 1)` and `evenOdd Q (i - 1)` are the same submodule; the statement below
names the first.

The parity statement is proved by induction over the grading; its base case is read off by
`CliffordAlgebra.exists_algebraMap_of_mem_range_ι_pow_zero` and
`CliffordAlgebra.exists_ι_of_mem_range_ι_pow_one`, which are general facts about the
grading and live with it.

## Main results

* `CliffordAlgebra.contractLeft_mem_evenOdd`: **contraction shifts the parity**.
* `CliffordAlgebra.involute_contractLeft`: `involute (d ⌋ x) = -(d ⌋ involute x)`.

/-- **The grade involution anticommutes with contraction.** Contracting against a linear
functional lowers the degree by one, hence swaps the even and odd parts of the Clifford algebra,
so it anticommutes with the operator that is `+1` on the even part and `-1` on the odd part. -/
