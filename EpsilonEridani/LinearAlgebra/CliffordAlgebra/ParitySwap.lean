# An odd linear automorphism of a Clifford algebra

The two halves `evenOdd Q 0` and `evenOdd Q 1` of the `ℤ/2`-grading of a Clifford algebra are in
general only submodules, with nothing relating their sizes. They become isomorphic as soon as some
*odd* operator on `CliffordAlgebra Q` is invertible, because an odd operator carries each half into
the other.

The odd operator to use is already in Mathlib: `CliffordAlgebra.changeFormAux Q B e`, the
difference

`x ↦ ι Q e * x - (B e)⌋x`

of left Clifford multiplication by a vector — which is exterior multiplication only in the special
case `Q = 0`, since in general it squares to `Q e` rather than to `0` — and contraction against the
functional `B e`. Mathlib introduces it to build `CliffordAlgebra.changeForm` and proves there that
it squares to the scalar `Q e - B e e` (`CliffordAlgebra.changeFormAux_changeFormAux`): expanding
the square leaves the two cross terms `ι Q e * ((B e)⌋x)` and `(B e)⌋(ι Q e * x)`, and
`CliffordAlgebra.contractLeft_ι_mul` rewrites the second as `B e e • x - ι Q e * ((B e)⌋x)`, whose
second term cancels the first cross term while `B e e • x` survives; multiplication contributes
`Q e • x` by the Clifford relation and the contraction squares to `0`.

What Mathlib does not record is that the operator is *odd*, both of its summands being odd
(`CliffordAlgebra.map_evenOdd_changeFormAux_le`). So whenever `Q e - B e e` is a unit the operator
is a linear automorphism (`CliffordAlgebra.paritySwapEquiv`) exchanging the two halves of the
grading.

Both degenerate choices are useful. Taking `B = 0` recovers multiplication by an anisotropic
vector, the classical reason a nondegenerate Clifford algebra has equidimensional halves; taking
`Q = 0` — the exterior algebra, where *no* vector is anisotropic — keeps exterior multiplication
by `e`, which on its own now squares to `0`, and has the contraction complement it: the combined
operator squares to `Q e - B e e = -B e e`, a unit as soon as `B e` does not annihilate `e`. That
second case is the one that was missing: it is what makes the two half-spin summands `⋀ᵉᵛᵉⁿ W` and
`⋀ᵒᵈᵈ W` of a spinor module equidimensional.

Over a field the hypothesis is never an obstruction: a nonzero vector space always carries such a
pair (`QuadraticMap.exists_sub_bilinForm_eq_one`), since a nonzero vector is not annihilated by
every functional, and a rank-one bilinear form built from such a functional turns `Q e - B e e`
into `1`. Hence `CliffordAlgebra.nonempty_evenOddEquivAddOne`: over a field, the two halves of the
grading of the Clifford algebra of a nonzero space are isomorphic, *for every quadratic form*. The
dimension count that follows is `CliffordAlgebra.finrank_evenOdd` in
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/CliffordAlgebra/Dimension.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `CliffordAlgebra.paritySwapEquiv`: `CliffordAlgebra.changeFormAux` as a linear automorphism,
  when `Q e - B e e` is a unit.
* `CliffordAlgebra.evenOddEquivAddOne`: the induced isomorphism `evenOdd Q i ≃ₗ evenOdd Q (i + 1)`.

## Main results

* `CliffordAlgebra.map_evenOdd_changeFormAux_le`: the operator is odd.
* `CliffordAlgebra.map_evenOdd_paritySwapEquiv`: it carries `evenOdd Q i` *onto*
  `evenOdd Q (i + 1)`.
* `QuadraticMap.exists_sub_bilinForm_eq_one`: over a field, a nonzero vector space carries a vector
  and a bilinear form with `Q e - B e e = 1`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.nonempty_evenOddEquivAddOne`: over a field, the two halves of the grading of the
  Clifford algebra of a nonzero space are isomorphic.
