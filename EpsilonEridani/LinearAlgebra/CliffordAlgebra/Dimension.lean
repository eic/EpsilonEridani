# Freeness and dimension of a Clifford algebra

The Clifford relation `ι Q m * ι Q m = Q m` does not preserve the number of generators in a
product, so a Clifford algebra is not graded by degree; what it does do is leave the *size* of the
algebra alone. Over a ring in which `2` is invertible this is Mathlib's
`CliffordAlgebra.equivExterior`, a
linear (not algebra) isomorphism `CliffordAlgebra Q ≃ₗ[R] ExteriorAlgebra R M` valid for every
quadratic form. Deforming the form therefore deforms the multiplication and nothing else, and the
underlying module of `CliffordAlgebra Q` is as free, and as large, as the exterior algebra of `M`.

This file records that. Over a commutative ring in which `2` is invertible, `CliffordAlgebra Q` is a
free `R`-module whenever `M` is, with an explicit basis
`CliffordAlgebra.basis Q b : Basis (Finset I) R (CliffordAlgebra Q)` attached to a basis `b`
of `M` indexed by a linearly ordered `I`, and it is finite of rank `2 ^ finrank R M` whenever `M` is
finite free. The `2 ^ n` is `∑ₖ (n choose k)` (`finrank_eq_sum_choose`), the count that a
degree-graded argument would produce one exterior power at a time; here it is the count of subsets
of a basis index set instead, because the basis is transported from Mathlib's basis
`Module.Basis.ExteriorAlgebra` of the exterior algebra, indexed by finite subsets.

A second section splits that count in half along Mathlib's `ℤ/2`-grading `evenOdd Q`. Over a field
the two halves of the grading of the Clifford algebra of a nonzero space are isomorphic for *every*
quadratic form, by the odd linear automorphism of
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/CliffordAlgebra/ParitySwap.lean`, so over a field in which `2` is
invertible, where the count `2 ^ n` above is available, each has dimension `2 ^ (n - 1)`, as does
the even subalgebra `CliffordAlgebra.even Q`.

These counts are what make the structure theory of Clifford algebras run: over an algebraically
closed field a nondegenerate `Q` on a `2l`-dimensional space has
`finrank (CliffordAlgebra Q) = 2 ^ (2 * l) = (2 ^ l) ^ 2`, matching `Module.End` of the
`2 ^ l`-dimensional spin module, so a surjection between the two is forced to be an isomorphism,
while `finrank (even Q) = 2 ^ (2 * l - 1) = 2 * (2 ^ (l - 1)) ^ 2` matches the product of two
matrix algebras one size down, acting on the two half-spin summands.

## Implementation notes

`basis` transports Mathlib's `Module.Basis.ExteriorAlgebra` along `equivExterior`, so its elements
are not by definition the products `ι Q (b i₁) * ⋯ * ι Q (b iₖ)` of generators: `equivExterior` is
built from `CliffordAlgebra.changeForm`, which corrects a product of generators by lower-order
terms. Nothing below needs the products, only their number. Identifying
the two families is the Clifford analogue of a Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem, and is the content
of the associated-graded isomorphism `gr (CliffordAlgebra Q) ≅ ExteriorAlgebra R M` against the
degree filtration of `EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/CliffordAlgebra/Filtration.lean`; it is left to that
separate milestone.

## Main definitions

* `CliffordAlgebra.basis`: the basis of `CliffordAlgebra Q` indexed by the finite subsets of
  the index set of a basis of `M`, over a ring in which `2` is invertible.

## Main results

* `CliffordAlgebra.rank_eq_rank_exteriorAlgebra` and
  `CliffordAlgebra.finrank_eq_finrank_exteriorAlgebra`: the rank of `CliffordAlgebra Q`
  is the rank of `ExteriorAlgebra R M`. The right-hand sides do not mention `Q`, so this is the
  statement that the size of a Clifford algebra does not depend on the quadratic form.
* `CliffordAlgebra.instFree` and `CliffordAlgebra.instFinite`: the Clifford algebra
  of a free module is free, and of a finite free module is finite.
* `CliffordAlgebra.finrank_eq_two_pow`: `finrank R (CliffordAlgebra Q) = 2 ^ finrank R M`,
  with `CliffordAlgebra.finrank_eq_sum_choose` the same count as a sum of binomial
  coefficients.
* `CliffordAlgebra.two_mul_finrank_evenOdd`: over a field, each half of the grading of the Clifford
  algebra of a nonzero space is exactly half of it, for every quadratic form, and
  `CliffordAlgebra.finrank_evenOdd_of_finrank_eq_two_pow` reads that half off any count of the
  whole algebra by a power of two.
* `CliffordAlgebra.finrank_evenOdd` and `CliffordAlgebra.finrank_even`: over a
  field in which `2` is invertible, each half of the grading of the Clifford algebra of a nonzero
  finite-dimensional space, and in particular the even subalgebra, has dimension
  `2 ^ (finrank K V - 1)`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.finrank_evenOdd_zero`: the same count for the zero form — the even and the odd
  half of an exterior algebra — where the total count is available over every field, so no
  invertibility of `2` is needed.

/-- **Each half of the `ℤ/2`-grading is exactly half of the Clifford algebra**, over a field and
for a nonzero space, whatever the quadratic form.

The two halves are complementary (`CliffordAlgebra.evenOdd_isCompl`), so their dimensions add up to
the whole; and they are equidimensional by `CliffordAlgebra.nonempty_evenOddEquivAddOne`, which
produces an odd linear automorphism out of a vector and a linear functional rather than out of an
anisotropic vector, so it covers the zero form — the exterior algebra — as well. The hypothesis
`V ≠ 0` cannot be dropped: for `V = 0` the Clifford algebra is `K` and entirely even.

Nothing here needs `2` to be invertible; that hypothesis enters only with
`CliffordAlgebra.finrank_eq_two_pow`, which evaluates the right-hand side. -/

space is counted by a positive power of two, `CliffordAlgebra.two_mul_finrank_evenOdd` splits that
count and each half of the `ℤ/2`-grading has dimension `2 ^ (n - 1)`.

The count of the whole algebra is left as a hypothesis because there are two sources for it, with
different requirements: `CliffordAlgebra.finrank_eq_two_pow` for an arbitrary quadratic form, which
needs `2` to be invertible, and the exterior-algebra count for the zero form, which does not. -/
