# The kernel of the Lipschitz action

The Lipschitz group acts on its quadratic space by twisted conjugation,
`lipschitzToOrthogonal Q : lipschitzGroup Q →* O(Q)`. Scalars act trivially. Conversely, an
element acting trivially graded-commutes with every vector, and for a nondegenerate form on a
finite-dimensional space over a field in which `2` is invertible such an element is a scalar
(`CliffordAlgebra.exists_eq_algebraMap_of_involute_mul_ι_eq_ι_mul`). When a vector has invertible
norm, the scalar units lie in the Lipschitz group and form exactly the kernel of the action.
This is the statement that makes the spinor norm of an isometry
independent of the Lipschitz element chosen to lift it: two lifts differ by a scalar.

## Main results

* `CliffordAlgebra.lipschitzToOrthogonal_eq_one_of_coe_eq_algebraMap`: a scalar acts trivially.
* `CliffordAlgebra.mem_ker_lipschitzToOrthogonal_iff`: an element of the Lipschitz group acts
  trivially exactly when it is a scalar unit.
* `CliffordAlgebra.ker_lipschitzToOrthogonal`: when a vector has invertible norm, the kernel of
  the Lipschitz action is the range of `CliffordAlgebra.scalarUnits`.
