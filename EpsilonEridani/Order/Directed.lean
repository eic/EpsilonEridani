# A directed family in a well-founded meet-semilattice attains its bound

In a complete meet-semilattice whose strict order is well founded, a nonempty downward-directed
family of elements contains its own infimum: a minimal member of the family is below every other
member, by directedness, so it *is* the infimum.

Mathlib's nearest statement is `CompleteLattice.IsSupClosedCompact`, which concludes `sSup s ∈ s`
from `WellFoundedGT` for a set closed under binary suprema. It is phrased for sup-closed sets, so
it does not directly cover an arbitrary directed family — a chain is directed but rarely closed —
and a directed family is what a descending filtration supplies.

## Main results

* `Directed.exists_eq_iInf`: a nonempty downward-directed family in a complete meet-semilattice
  with `WellFoundedLT` attains its infimum.

/-- **A nonempty downward-directed family in a well-founded complete meet-semilattice attains its
infimum.**

Only arbitrary infima are used, so `CompleteSemilatticeInf` is the natural hypothesis; a complete
lattice is the case of interest.

Nonemptiness of the index is needed: over an empty index the infimum is the greatest element
and no member attains it. -/
