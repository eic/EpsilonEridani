# The product rule for weak derivatives

A weak derivative is additive and commutes with scalars
(`EpsilonEridani.HasWeakLineDerivOn.add`, `EpsilonEridani.HasWeakLineDerivOn.const_smul`), but Lane A of the PDE
roadmap needs one more algebraic rule before it can localize: multiplication by a *variable*
smooth factor.  This file proves it.  For a smooth `ψ : E → ℝ` and a weakly differentiable `u`,

`∂_v (ψ u) = ψ ∂_v u + (∂_v ψ) u`

on `Ω`, in the weak sense of `EpsilonEridani.HasWeakLineDerivOn`.

The proof is the one-line distributional computation.  Testing `ψ u` against `∂_v φ` is the same
as testing `u` against `ψ ∂_v φ = ∂_v (ψ φ) − (∂_v ψ) φ`, and `ψ φ` is again a test function on
`Ω`, because multiplying by a smooth function neither enlarges a support nor destroys smoothness.
So the defining identity for `u` applies to it, and the leftover term `(∂_v ψ) φ` is the second
summand of the Leibniz formula.  No smoothness of `u` is used, and no boundary hypothesis on `Ω`:
`ψ φ` is compactly supported *inside* `Ω`, so no boundary term appears.

Smoothness of `ψ` is more than the identity needs — `C¹` would do — but it is what makes `ψ φ` a
member of Mathlib's `TestFunction` type, whose smoothness order is `∞`, and it is what every
intended application supplies (cutoffs are built from `ContDiffBump`).

## Why this is the localization tool

`ψ` will be a cutoff.  Multiplying by one is how a global statement about `W^{k,p}(Ω)` is reduced
to a local one: it is the first step of the Meyers–Serrin `H = W` density theorem and of the
extension operator (Lane A.2 and A.6 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/PDE/README.md`), and it is what turns an
interior estimate into an estimate on a compactly contained subdomain (Lane E.20).  The second
summand `(∂_v ψ) u` is exactly the error such an argument has to absorb, so having it with an
explicit, non-asymptotic formula is the point.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.HasWeakLineDerivOn.contDiff_smul`: the Leibniz rule in a direction `v`.
* `EpsilonEridani.HasWeakFDerivOn.contDiff_smul`: its Fréchet form, with the rank-one correction
  `(fderiv ℝ ψ x).smulRight (u x)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.HasWeakFDerivOn.contDiff_smul_gradient`: the form consumed by `EpsilonEridani.W1p`, where a
  weak derivative of a scalar function is recorded by its Riesz representative and the rule reads
  `∇(ψ u) = ψ ∇u + u ∇ψ`.

/-- **The Leibniz rule for weak directional derivatives.** If `u'` is a weak derivative of `u` in
the direction `v` on `Ω` and `ψ` is smooth, then `ψ u` is weakly differentiable in the direction
`v` on `Ω`, with derivative `ψ u' + (∂_v ψ) u`.

Nothing is assumed about `Ω` beyond openness: the test function `ψ φ` used in the proof is still
compactly supported inside `Ω`, so the boundary term of the classical integration by parts is
absent here just as it is in the definition. -/
