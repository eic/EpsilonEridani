# Continuous logarithms on simple arcs

A zero-free continuous complex-valued function on a **simple arc** has a continuous logarithm.
Here an arc is presented as the range of a path `γ : Path x y` whose parametrization is an
embedding; the main theorem is `EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_range_of_isEmbedding_path`.

The proof extends `γ` constantly to `ℝ` and lifts `g ∘ γ.extend` through the covering map
`Complex.exp : ℂ → ℂ \ {0}`. Since `ℝ` is simply connected, Mathlib's
`Complex.exists_continuousOn_eqOn_exp_comp` supplies the lift, and the embedding hypothesis makes
the parametrization a homeomorphism onto the range, along which the lift descends to the arc
itself. The Borsuk-map specialization
`EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_sub_div_sub_range_of_injective_path` records the form used by plane
separation; there the embedding comes for free, an injective path from the compact unit interval
into a Hausdorff space being a closed embedding. No formalization is vendored.

## Roadmap role

The Carathéodory enclosure step (layer **L5** of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`) is now unconditional: the
preconnectedness/winding-number route in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Crosscut/Inside.lean` discharges it without plane
separation. The classical separation route — Borsuk's criterion (PR #4701) plus arc
nonseparation — remains relevant for future work. This file supplies the logarithm
construction needed for that
route: applying `EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_sub_div_sub_range_of_injective_path` shows that any two
points off a simple arc lie in the same component of its complement.

This is deliberately stated for paths in an arbitrary topological space, since neither the lifting
argument nor descent to the range uses planar geometry. The logarithm is still complex-valued, as
required by `EpsilonEridani.HasContinuousLogOn` and by the L5 Borsuk-map consumer.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_range_of_isEmbedding_path` — every zero-free continuous function on
  the range of a path with embedded parametrization has a continuous logarithm.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_sub_div_sub_range_of_injective_path` — the Borsuk map of two points
  outside a simple complex arc has a continuous logarithm on that arc.

path whose parametrization is an embedding. If `g` is continuous and nonzero on `range γ`, then
there is a function continuous on `range γ` whose exponential is `g` there. -/

/-- **The Borsuk map of two points off a simple complex arc has a continuous logarithm on the
arc.** The two nonmembership hypotheses say exactly that the numerator and the denominator of
`z ↦ (z - a) / (z - b)` do not vanish along the arc.

Together with Borsuk's converse criterion for bounded closed sets, this is the standard proof that
an arc does not separate the plane. -/
