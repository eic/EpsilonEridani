# Continuous logarithms on a set, and the Borsuk map of two points

A complex-valued function `g` **has a continuous logarithm on** a set `S` when some `h`,
continuous on `S`, satisfies `exp (h x) = g x` throughout `S`; this file introduces that predicate,
`EpsilonEridani.HasContinuousLogOn`, and proves the two elementary facts about it that planar separation
arguments run on.

The predicate is the natural home of the classical *nonvanishing plus no winding* condition. It
implies `g` is continuous and zero-free on `S` but is strictly stronger, and unlike Mathlib's
`Complex.exists_continuousOn_eqOn_exp_comp` — which produces a logarithm on a *simply connected
open* set — it makes sense, and is genuinely restrictive, on a set with no interior at all: a
compact `K ⊆ ℂ` such as a curve. That is exactly the case the separation theory needs, so the
existence statement has to become a predicate carrying its own algebra rather than a one-off
lemma. That algebra is the one the zero-free continuous functions carry: the property is closed
under multiplication and under inversion, the witnesses adding
(`EpsilonEridani.HasContinuousLogOn.mul`) and negating (`EpsilonEridani.HasContinuousLogOn.inv`) accordingly; it
restricts along inclusions, and it holds outright when `g` avoids the slit `Complex.slitPlane`ᶜ,
where the principal branch works (`EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_of_mapsTo_slitPlane`).

## Gluing along a connected overlap

The first substantial fact is that continuous logarithms glue: if `S` and `T` are closed, their
overlap `S ∩ T` is preconnected, and `g` has a continuous logarithm on each, then it has one on
`S ∪ T` (`EpsilonEridani.HasContinuousLogOn.union`). Two logarithms of the same function differ by a
value of `Complex.exp ⁻¹' {1}`, that is by an integer multiple of `2 * π * I`; distinct such
multiples are `2 * π` apart, so that fibre is a discrete subset of `ℂ` and the difference, being
continuous on a preconnected overlap, is constant there. So one logarithm can be shifted by a
single constant to agree with the other on the overlap, and the two then define one continuous
function on the closed union. The constancy step is isolated as
`EpsilonEridani.eq_of_isPreconnected_of_forall_exp_eq_one`.

## The Borsuk map

For `a b : ℂ` the **Borsuk map** of the pair is `z ↦ (z - a) / (z - b)`, defined and zero-free off
`{a, b}`. Its logarithms detect how a set sits between the two points: the main theorem here is
that if `b` lies in the connected component of `a` in the complement of a closed `K`, then the
Borsuk map has a continuous logarithm on `K`
(`EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_sub_div_sub`). Equivalently, in contrapositive form: if the Borsuk map
admits no continuous logarithm on `K`, then `b ∉ connectedComponentIn Kᶜ a` — which, once both
points are known to lie outside `K`, says that `K` *separates* `a` from `b`.

The proof is a connectedness argument on the second point, not a construction. Call `w`
*good* if `z ↦ (z - a) / (z - w)` has a continuous logarithm on `K`. The point `a` is good, its
Borsuk map being the constant `1`. Moving `w` by less than half the distance from `w` to `K`
multiplies the Borsuk map by `z ↦ (z - w) / (z - w')`, a function whose values lie within distance
`1` of `1` and hence in the slit plane, so that factor has a logarithm of its own
(`EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_sub_div_sub_of_norm_lt`) and goodness transfers — in both directions,
since the estimate is symmetric. So the good and the bad points of `Kᶜ` are both open, and the
component of `a` is preconnected, hence entirely good.

## What this settles, and what it does not

Only one implication of the classical criterion is proved here. Its converse — that a Borsuk map
with a continuous logarithm on a *bounded* closed `K` forces `a` and `b` into one component of
`Kᶜ` — is the deeper half, and is proved separately, in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/PlaneSeparation/Basic.lean`, as
`EpsilonEridani.mem_connectedComponentIn_of_hasContinuousLogOn`. Boundedness is essential there and is
not assumed here. Nothing below uses that converse, and no statement below is phrased so as to
presume it; in particular the naive route to it, through winding numbers of curves drawn inside
`K`, is unavailable, since a compact connected set can separate the plane while containing no arc
at all.

## Roadmap role

**Plane separation for Jordan curves** was an open frontier item of layer **L5** of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`, the Carathéodory boundary correspondence.
`EpsilonEridani.image_inter_ball_subset_filledHull_of_diam_lt_of_isPreconnected_sdiff_singleton` of
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Crosscut/Inside.lean` avoids the plane-separation hypothesis
entirely by taking `IsPreconnected (K \ {f z₀})` instead, which
`IsJordanCurve.isPathConnected_sdiff_singleton` discharges; `Caratheodory.lean` is now
unconditional. The remaining open statement is
`frontier Ω ∩ closure A ∩ closure B ⊆ closure γ`, the input
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Crosscut/BoundarySplit.lean` names as missing before its
dichotomy `EpsilonEridani.subset_or_subset_of_isPreconnected_frontier_image_sdiff` can be fed a boundary
arc.

The classical route to both runs through Janiszewski's theorem — two closed sets with connected
intersection, neither of which separates a pair of points, have a union that does not separate it
either — and Janiszewski is proved by translating "does not separate" into "the Borsuk map has a
continuous logarithm" and gluing the two logarithms over the connected intersection. This file
supplies that translation in the direction that holds without duality, together with the gluing;
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/PlaneSeparation/Basic.lean` adds the converse direction and assembles the
three into `EpsilonEridani.janiszewski`.

The one statement below already phrased in the vocabulary of that development is
`EpsilonEridani.mem_filledHull_or_mem_filledHull_of_not_hasContinuousLogOn`: a bounded closed set on which
the Borsuk map has no continuous logarithm encloses `a` or `b` in its filled hull. It reads the
criterion through `EpsilonEridani.mem_filledHull_or_mem_filledHull_of_notMem_connectedComponentIn` of
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Normed/Module/FilledHull.lean`, so a source of logarithm obstructions becomes a
source of the enclosure hypothesis `Conformal/Crosscut/Inside.lean` consumes.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Mathlib has continuous branches of the logarithm on simply connected open sets
(`Complex.exists_continuousOn_eqOn_exp_comp` of `Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/BranchLogRoot.lean`,
which layer L3 consumes), but no predicate for a logarithm on an arbitrary set, no gluing theorem
for logarithms, and no separation theory for the plane. Layer L5 is absent from
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the in-progress
human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort, which stops at the mapping theorem itself. So this
file is new Lean formalization rather than a temporary shim, and it consumes no L0–L3 shim: its
only complex-analytic input is the principal branch `Complex.log` on `Complex.slitPlane`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.HasContinuousLogOn` — the predicate, with `EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_iff` exposing it,
  and its closure properties `EpsilonEridani.HasContinuousLogOn.mul`, `.inv`, `.div`, `.mono`, `.congr`.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_of_mapsTo_slitPlane` — a function landing in the slit plane has the
  principal logarithm.
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_of_isPreconnected_of_forall_exp_eq_one` — a preconnected set of logarithms of `1` is
  a single point.
* `EpsilonEridani.HasContinuousLogOn.union` — **gluing**: logarithms on two closed sets with preconnected
  overlap combine into one on the union.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_sub_div_sub_of_norm_lt` — the Borsuk map of two points closer to each
  other than to `K` has a logarithm on `K`.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_sub_div_sub` — **the criterion**: the Borsuk map of two points in one
  component of the complement of a closed set has a continuous logarithm on that set.
* `EpsilonEridani.mem_filledHull_or_mem_filledHull_of_not_hasContinuousLogOn` — its separation-facing
  form: a bounded closed set admitting no such logarithm encloses one of the two points.

/-- **The Borsuk-map criterion, sufficient direction.** If `b` lies in the connected component of
`a` in the complement of a closed set `K`, then the Borsuk map `z ↦ (z - a) / (z - b)` has a
continuous logarithm on `K`.

Contrapositively: if a closed set `K` carries no continuous logarithm of the Borsuk map of `a` and
`b`, then `b ∉ connectedComponentIn Kᶜ a`; for `a`, `b` outside `K` that says the two points lie in
different components of `Kᶜ`, and otherwise one of them lies in `K` itself.

The proof moves the second point rather than constructing the logarithm. The set of points `w` of
`Kᶜ` for which `z ↦ (z - a) / (z - w)` has a logarithm on `K` is open, because displacing `w` by
less than half its distance to `K` multiplies the Borsuk map by a factor covered by
`EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_sub_div_sub_of_norm_lt`; the same estimate run backwards makes the
complementary set of `Kᶜ` open too. Since `a` itself is in the first set — its Borsuk map is the

/-- **A bounded closed set with no continuous logarithm of a Borsuk map encloses one of the two
points.** This is `EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_sub_div_sub` read through
`EpsilonEridani.mem_filledHull_or_mem_filledHull_of_notMem_connectedComponentIn`: failure of the logarithm
gives `b ∉ connectedComponentIn Kᶜ a`, so either one of the two points lies in `K`, and hence in the
filled hull outright, or they lie in different components of `Kᶜ`, of which at most one can be the
unbounded component of a bounded set's complement.

It is the form in which an obstruction to a logarithm delivers the enclosure hypothesis of
`EpsilonEridani.image_inter_ball_subset_filledHull_of_diam_lt_of_isPreconnected_sdiff_singleton`. -/
