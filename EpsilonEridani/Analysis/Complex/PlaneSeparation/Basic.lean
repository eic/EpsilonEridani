# Borsuk's separation criterion and Janiszewski's theorem

Two points `a`, `b` of the plane lie in the same connected component of the complement of a compact
set `K` **exactly when** the *Borsuk map* `z ↦ (z - a) / (z - b)` admits a continuous logarithm on
`K`. `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/ContinuousLog/Basic.lean` introduces the predicate
`EpsilonEridani.HasContinuousLogOn` and proves the implication that needs no duality — a logarithm exists
as soon as the two points are joined inside `Kᶜ` (`EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_sub_div_sub`) — and
records the converse as the missing input. This file proves the converse,
`EpsilonEridani.mem_connectedComponentIn_of_hasContinuousLogOn`, and reads the resulting equivalence off
as **Janiszewski's theorem**: two bounded closed sets whose intersection is preconnected, neither of
which separates `a` from `b`, have a union that does not separate them either.

## The argument

Boundedness of `K` is essential: the real axis separates `i` from `-i`, yet the Borsuk map of that
pair is a homeomorphism of `ℝ` onto the circle minus a point and so has a logarithm. What
boundedness buys is that at most one component of `Kᶜ` is unbounded
(`EpsilonEridani.connectedComponentIn_compl_eq_of_unbounded_component`), so of two points in *different*
components at least one — say `a`, after exchanging them and inverting the Borsuk map — has a
**bounded** component `V`.

Suppose then that the Borsuk map has a logarithm `h` on `K`. Extend `h` to a continuous
`H : ℂ → ℂ` by Tietze and put `G = exp ∘ H`: a *nowhere-vanishing* continuous function on the whole
plane agreeing with `(z - a) / (z - b)` on `K`. The component `V` is open, its frontier lies in `K`
(`EpsilonEridani.frontier_connectedComponentIn_subset_compl`), and `b` misses `closure V = V ∪ frontier V`.
The globally continuous functions `z ↦ G z * (z - b)` and `z ↦ z - a` agree on
`frontier (closure V) ⊆ frontier V ⊆ K`, because there
`G z * (z - b) = ((z - a) / (z - b)) * (z - b) = z - a`. Therefore
`Continuous.piecewise` shows that their piecewise combination

> `Φ = (closure V).piecewise (fun z => G z * (z - b)) (fun z => z - a)`

is continuous, and it vanishes nowhere: on `closure V` because `G` is zero-free and
`b ∉ closure V`, off `closure V` because `a ∈ V`.

A zero-free continuous function on the plane has a continuous logarithm by
`Complex.exists_continuousOn_eqOn_exp_comp`, hence so does its restriction to any circle. But `V`
is bounded, so a large enough circle about `a` misses `closure V`, and there `Φ z = z - a`, which
has **no** continuous logarithm on a circle about `a`
(`EpsilonEridani.not_hasContinuousLogOn_sub_sphere`) — the classical winding obstruction, proved here by
following `t ↦ h (a + r * exp (t * I)) - t * I - log r` once around and finding it both constant and
shifted by `2 * π * I`. That contradiction is the theorem.

Nothing in the argument looks at curves inside `K`, or asks `K` to be connected, locally connected,
or to contain an arc; `K` enters only through the frontier of one component of its complement.

## Roadmap role

**Plane separation for Jordan curves** was the open frontier item of layer **L5** of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`, the Carathéodory boundary correspondence.
`EpsilonEridani.image_inter_ball_subset_filledHull_of_diam_lt_of_isPreconnected_sdiff_singleton` of
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Crosscut/Inside.lean` avoids the plane-separation hypothesis
entirely by taking `IsPreconnected (K \ {f z₀})` instead, which
`IsJordanCurve.isPathConnected_sdiff_singleton` discharges; `Caratheodory.lean` is now
unconditional. `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/ContinuousLog/Basic.lean` names the remaining open
statement on the classical route through Janiszewski's theorem — the converse direction — and
this file supplies it, so `EpsilonEridani.janiszewski` is available to that route as well.

Mathlib has no separation theory for the plane and no Jordan curve theorem, and layer L5 is absent
from [mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the in-progress
human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort. The lifting of a zero-free continuous function
through `Complex.exp` is supplied by Mathlib's `Complex.exists_continuousOn_eqOn_exp_comp`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.not_hasContinuousLogOn_sub_sphere` — `z ↦ z - a` has no continuous logarithm on a circle
  centred at `a`.
* `EpsilonEridani.mem_connectedComponentIn_of_hasContinuousLogOn` — **Borsuk's separation theorem**: a
  continuous logarithm of the Borsuk map on a bounded closed set puts the two points in one
  component of the complement.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_sub_div_sub_iff` — the resulting equivalence.
* `EpsilonEridani.janiszewski` — **Janiszewski's theorem**.

/-- **Borsuk's separation theorem.** If the Borsuk map `z ↦ (z - a) / (z - b)` of two points
outside a bounded closed set `K ⊆ ℂ` has a continuous logarithm on `K`, then `K` does not separate
them: `b` lies in the connected component of `a` in `Kᶜ`.

That the two points lie outside `K` is not assumed: the Borsuk map vanishes at `a` and, by the
division convention, at `b` as well, so a logarithm on `K` already excludes both from `K`.

This is the converse of `EpsilonEridani.hasContinuousLogOn_sub_div_sub`, and the direction that fails
without boundedness — the real axis separates `i` from `-i` while carrying a logarithm of their
Borsuk map. -/
