# Distance-preserving maps of a disc about the origin

Mathlib's `Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/Isometry.lean` classifies the **linear** isometries of the
plane: `linear_isometry_complex` says that every `f : ℂ ≃ₗᵢ[ℝ] ℂ` is `rotation a` or
`conjLIE.trans (rotation a)`. That statement asks for a map defined on all of `ℂ`, and asks it to
be both `ℝ`-linear and surjective. This file drops all three hypotheses at once: for a map `g`
defined on a disc `ball 0 r` about the origin, fixing the origin and merely preserving distances
between points of that disc, the *restriction of `g` to that disc* is the restriction of
`z ↦ u * z`, or of `z ↦ u * conj z`, for a single unit `u`. The alternative is not chosen point by
point — that single choice is the content of the theorem.

Linearity and surjectivity are dropped as hypotheses; they are not put back as conclusions.
Nothing is claimed about `g` off the disc, so `g` itself need be neither linear nor surjective, and
the theorem says only that on `ball 0 r` it agrees with a map that is.

The proof is the classical orthonormal-frame argument. `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/
Isometry.lean` turns the distance hypothesis into preservation of the real inner product that `ℂ`
carries (`Complex.inner : ⟪w, z⟫_ℝ = (z * conj w).re`). The two probe points `r / 2` and `I * r / 2`
of the disc then have images whose doublings-by-`2 / r` are an orthonormal pair `e`, `f`, and
`⟪e, g z⟫_ℝ`, `⟪f, g z⟫_ℝ` read off the real and imaginary parts of `z`. Orthogonality of two unit
complex numbers means a quarter turn, `f = e * I` or `f = -(e * I)`
(`EpsilonEridani.eq_mul_I_or_eq_neg_mul_I_of_real_inner_eq_zero`, where Mathlib's two-dimensional
orientation API enters, its quarter turn `Complex.rightAngleRotation` being multiplication by
`I`), and pairing `g z` against `e` and against `e * I` recovers `g z` as `e * z` in the first case
and as `e * conj z` in the second — the alternative being fixed once, by `f`, and not per point.

That argument is adapted from the proof of
`EpsilonEridani.exists_norm_eq_one_eqOn_ball_const_mul_or_const_mul_conj` and its `private` scaffolding
(`real_inner_eq`, `im_conj_mul`, `exists_orthonormal_pair_real_inner_map_eq`,
`eq_mul_I_or_eq_neg_mul_I`) in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Poincare/Isometry/Classification.lean`, as merged in
EpsilonEridani#1502; here the unit radius is relaxed to an arbitrary `r > 0` and the hyperbolic
hypothesis is replaced by the Euclidean one the argument actually used.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.eq_mul_I_or_eq_neg_mul_I_of_real_inner_eq_zero` — two orthogonal unit vectors of the
  Euclidean plane `ℂ` differ by the quarter turn `z ↦ z * I`.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_norm_eq_one_eqOn_ball_const_mul_or_const_mul_conj_of_dist_map_eq` — **the
  classification**: a distance-preserving self-map of `ball 0 r` fixing `0` is a rotation or a
  rotated conjugation there, and
  `EpsilonEridani.exists_norm_eq_one_eqOn_ball_const_mul_or_const_mul_conj_iff` — the converse packaged
  with it, the rotations and rotated conjugations being exactly the maps in question.

The consumer is `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Poincare/Isometry/Classification.lean`, which
classifies the isometries of the Poincaré disc: an isometry of the hyperbolic metric fixing the
origin is a Euclidean isometry of the disc fixing the origin, so the hyperbolic classification is
this Euclidean one together with the Moebius factor that moves the base point. This supports the
hyperbolic-metric layer L2 of the conformal-mapping roadmap
(`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`) without adding to it.

/-- **Two orthogonal unit vectors of the plane differ by a quarter turn.** For unit complex
numbers `z` and `w` with `⟪z, w⟫_ℝ = 0`, either `w = z * I` or `w = -(z * I)`.

The plane being two-dimensional, the orthogonal complement of a nonzero `z` is the real line
through the quarter turn `z * I`; that is Mathlib's
`Submodule.mem_span_singleton_of_inner_eq_zero_of_inner_eq_zero`, the quarter turn being
`Complex.orientation.rightAngleRotation` (`Complex.rightAngleRotation`). Being a unit vector, the
real multiple it produces is `1` or `-1`. -/

serves every point; that is what later fixes a single `u` in the classification. -/

/-- **Distance-preserving self-maps of a disc fixing its centre are rotations and rotated
conjugations.** A map of `ball 0 r` that fixes `0` and preserves the distance between any two of
its points agrees on that disc with `z ↦ u * z`, or with `z ↦ u * conj z`, for a single unit `u`.

No linearity and no surjectivity are assumed, and the map is only constrained on the disc; this is
what separates the statement from Mathlib's `linear_isometry_complex`, which classifies the
elements of `ℂ ≃ₗᵢ[ℝ] ℂ`. The single `u`, and the single choice between the two alternatives, are
the content: a priori each point of the disc could be reflected or not independently. -/
