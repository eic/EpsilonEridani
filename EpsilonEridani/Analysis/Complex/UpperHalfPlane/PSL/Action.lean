# `PSL(2)` actions on the upper half-plane

The projective special linear groups `PSL(2, ℤ)` and `PSL(2, ℝ)` (quotients of `SL(2, ·)`
by their centers `{±I}`) act faithfully on the upper half-plane `ℍ`. The `PSL(2, ℝ)`-action
is the central-quotient descent of the `SL(2, R)`-action, uniformly in the coefficients;
it agrees with Mathlib's `PGL(2, ℝ)`-action along `toPGL` (`toPGL_smul`) and with
the `PSL(2, ℤ)`-action along the injective descent `psl2zToPSL2R` from
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/ProjectiveSpecialLinearGroup.lean`. The actions are
measurable and preserve the invariant measure `volume : Measure ℍ` (inherited from
Mathlib's `GL(2, ℝ)`-invariance).

## Main results

* `UpperHalfPlane.smul_eq_self_of_mem_center` — the center of `SL(2, R)` acts trivially,
  for any coefficients mapping to `ℝ`.
* `UpperHalfPlane.instMulActionPSL2` — the `PSL(2, R)`-action for any coefficients mapping
  to `ℝ`, descending the `SL(2, R)`-action along the central quotient, with the
  representative compatibility `pslMk_smul` and its pointwise-image form
  `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.pslMk_smul_set`.
* `FaithfulSMul` instances for `PSL(2, ℤ)` and `PSL(2, ℝ)` on `ℍ`, restricting Mathlib's
  faithful `PGL(2, ℝ)`-action along the injective `toPGL` and `psl2zToPSL2R`.
* `SMulInvariantMeasure` instances for `SL(2, R)` and `PSL(2, R)` (any coefficients
  mapping to `ℝ`) on `(ℍ, volume)`.
* `UpperHalfPlane.smul_eq_smul_of_coe_eq_smul` — matrices differing by a nonzero scalar act
  identically on `ℍ`.
* `UpperHalfPlane.glPosToPSL2R_smul` — the det-normalized projective representative of a
  `GL(2, ℝ)⁺` element (multiplicative by `Real.sqrt_mul` together with the centrality of
  positive scalars) acts on `ℍ` exactly as the original element.

Ported from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project
(`LeanModularForms/Modularforms/PSL2Action.lean`); the AINTLIB Jacobian computation of
`SL(2, ℤ)`-invariance of the hyperbolic measure is **not** ported — Mathlib's
`SMulInvariantMeasure (GL (Fin 2) ℝ) ℍ volume` subsumes it, and all invariance instances
here descend from it.
