# The elliptic disc of a point of the upper half-plane

Let `Γ ≤ PSL(2, ℝ)` be a subgroup and `z` a point of the upper half-plane. The stabilizer of `z`
in `Γ` acts by hyperbolic isometries fixing `z`, so it preserves every hyperbolic disc
`Subgroup.stabilizerBall Γ z ε` about `z`. If the action of `Γ` is properly discontinuous — in
particular if `Γ` is discrete — then for small `ε` no other element of `Γ` moves that disc to meet
itself (`EpsilonEridani.exists_ball_disjoint_smul_of_notMem_stabilizer`). This separation result is the
key input identifying a neighbourhood in the full orbit space with the quotient of the disc by
the finite group `MulAction.stabilizer Γ z`.

That orbit space is computed here. In the disc coordinate centred at `z` the stabilizer acts by
the group of `m`-th roots of unity, `m` its order
(`Subgroup.stabilizerRotationEquiv`, `Subgroup.discCoordinate_smul_eq_rotation_smul`), and the
disc of hyperbolic radius `ε` becomes the Euclidean disc of radius `tanh (ε / 2)`
(`UpperHalfPlane.image_discCoordinate_ball`). The orbit map of a rotation group of order `m` on a
disc is `u ↦ u ^ m` (`EpsilonEridani.rootsOfUnityBallQuotientHomeomorph`), so the orbit space is again a
disc, with coordinate `(disc coordinate) ^ m`. This power-map model is intended for the later
construction of a smooth chart on the full quotient and the proof that its quotient map has
multiplicity `m`; those conclusions are not established in this file.

## Main declarations

* `Subgroup.stabilizerBall`: the hyperbolic disc about `z`, as a set invariant under the
  stabilizer of `z`.
* `Subgroup.stabilizerBallHomeomorph`: the disc coordinate, as a homeomorphism from that disc onto
  a Euclidean disc, equivariant for `Subgroup.stabilizerRotationEquiv`.
* `Subgroup.stabilizerBallQuotientHomeomorph`: the orbit space of the invariant disc under the
  stabilizer is the Euclidean disc of radius `tanh (ε / 2) ^ m`, with coordinate the `m`-th power
  of the disc coordinate.
* `Subgroup.stabilizerBallQuotientToQuotient`: the induced map from the local orbit space to
  `Γ \ ℍ`; for all sufficiently small positive radii it is an open embedding.

/-- **The disc coordinate flattens the invariant hyperbolic disc**: it is a homeomorphism from
the hyperbolic disc of radius `ε` about `z` onto the Euclidean disc of radius `tanh (ε / 2)`
about `0`, carrying the stabilizer action to the rotation action of the `m`-th roots of unity by
`Subgroup.stabilizerBallHomeomorph_smul`. Its underlying coordinate and explicit inverse are
holomorphic by `UpperHalfPlane.mdifferentiable_discCoordinate` and
`UpperHalfPlane.analyticOnNhd_discCoordinateHomeomorph_symm`.

The stabilizer is assumed finite because the codomain needs it: `EpsilonEridani.rootsOfUnityBall m` is
defined only for `m ≠ 0`, and for `m = 0` the group `rootsOfUnity 0 ℂ` is the whole unit group,
which does not preserve a disc. The finiteness-free geometry is
`UpperHalfPlane.discCoordinateHomeomorph` together with `UpperHalfPlane.image_discCoordinate_ball`,
of which this is the packaging against the roots-of-unity model. -/

/-- **The stabilizer quotient coordinate.** For `0 ≤ ε`, the orbit space of the invariant
hyperbolic disc of radius `ε` about `z` under the stabilizer of `z`, a group of order `m`, is the
Euclidean disc of radius `tanh (ε / 2) ^ m`; the identification sends the orbit of `τ` to the
`m`-th power of its disc coordinate. A positive radius and a later quotient-neighbourhood
construction are needed to turn this model into a chart on the full `Γ`-orbit space. The
separation supplied by `EpsilonEridani.exists_ball_disjoint_smul_of_notMem_stabilizer` is one input to
that later construction. -/
