# Point stabilizers of subgroups of `PSL(2, ℝ)`

The transformations fixing a point `z` of the upper half-plane are recorded by their derivative
there. By the chain rule that derivative is multiplicative on the stabilizer, so it is a
character `stabilizer Γ z →* ℂ` for any subgroup `Γ ≤ PSL(2, ℝ)`, and it is injective: a Möbius
transformation fixing `z` with derivative `1` there is the identity. Hence a point stabilizer is
commutative, and cyclic as soon as it is finite — a finite subgroup of the multiplicative monoid
of a field is cyclic.

The injectivity of the character turns the order of a generator into the order of its
derivative, so the derivative of a generator of a finite point stabilizer is a primitive root of
unity whose order is the order of the stabilizer. Consequently the character identifies a finite
point stabilizer of order `m` with the group of `m`-th roots of unity, and in the disc coordinate
centred at the fixed point the stabilizer acts by exactly those rotations. Finally, every
nontrivial element of a point stabilizer is an elliptic matrix.

The specialization to discrete subgroups, whose point stabilizers are finite, is
`EpsilonEridani.Analysis.Complex.Fuchsian.Stabilizer`.

## Main declarations

* `Subgroup.stabilizerDeriv`: the derivative character of a point stabilizer, and
  `Subgroup.stabilizerDeriv_injective`.
* `Subgroup.isCyclic_stabilizer`: a finite point stabilizer is cyclic.
* `Subgroup.exists_isPrimitiveRoot_stabilizerDeriv`: a generator of a finite point
  stabilizer has a primitive root of unity of the stabilizer's order as its derivative.
* `Subgroup.stabilizerRotation` and `Subgroup.stabilizerRotationEquiv`: the derivative character
  of a point stabilizer, and, for a finite stabilizer of order `m`, the isomorphism it gives onto
  the `m`-th roots of unity.
* `Subgroup.discCoordinate_stabilizer_smul` and `Subgroup.discCoordinate_smul_eq_rotation_smul`:
  in the disc coordinate centred at the fixed point, an element of the stabilizer acts by
  multiplication by its derivative, that is, by its rotation.
* `Subgroup.mem_orbit_stabilizer_iff_discCoordinate_pow_eq_pow`: two points lie in the same
  orbit of a finite stabilizer of order `m` exactly when their disc coordinates have the same
  `m`-th power.
* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.isElliptic_of_smul_eq_self_of_ne_one`: a matrix fixing a point of
  `ℍ` and nontrivial in `PSL(2, ℝ)` is elliptic.
* `Matrix.ProjectiveSpecialLinearGroup.eq_one_of_smul_eq_self_of_smul_eq_self`: a nontrivial
  element of `PSL(2, ℝ)` fixes at most one point of `ℍ`.
