# Geodesic lines in the upper half-plane, transported from the imaginary axis

Mathlib's `UpperHalfPlane.isometry_vertical_line` already exhibits the imaginary axis, in its
upward unit-speed parametrisation `t ↦ mk ⟨0, exp t⟩ _`, as a geodesic line, and Tau Ceti's
`IsIsometricSMul PSL(2, ℝ) ℍ` (`ProperAction.lean`) already gives the isometric action of the
group Fuchsian groups are subgroups of. This file only composes the two: the `PSL(2, ℝ)`-translate
of the imaginary axis by any `g` is again a geodesic line, and every one of these is unit-speed
(`isometry_geodesicLine`), hence injective (`geodesicLine_injective`) and at explicit distance
`|s - t|` between its parameters (`dist_geodesicLine`).

This is the transport step behind the classical description of hyperbolic geodesics in `ℍ` as
vertical lines and semicircles centred on the real axis: as a *set*, the image of the map
`geodesicLine g` is the `g`-translate of the imaginary axis, which is a vertical line when the
representing matrix's lower-left entry `g 1 0` or lower-right entry `g 1 1` is `0` (equivalently,
`g` sends one of the imaginary axis's two boundary points, `0` and the point at infinity, to the
point at infinity) and a semicircle centred on the real axis otherwise. That case split is not
proved here. A geodesic line through one prescribed point is (`exists_geodesicLine_zero_eq`);
one through two prescribed points is not.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.UpperHalfPlane.geodesicLine g` — the imaginary axis in its upward unit-speed
  parametrisation, moved by `g`: the map `t ↦ g • UpperHalfPlane.mk ⟨0, exp t⟩ _`.
  `geodesicLine_one_apply` and `geodesicLine_zero` give its value at `g = 1` and at `t = 0`.
* `EpsilonEridani.UpperHalfPlane.isometry_geodesicLine` — `geodesicLine g` is an isometric embedding
  of `ℝ`, hence injective (`geodesicLine_injective`).
* `EpsilonEridani.UpperHalfPlane.dist_geodesicLine` — the distance between two of its points is
  `|s - t|`.
* `EpsilonEridani.UpperHalfPlane.smul_geodesicLine` — further translating a geodesic line by `h` gives
  the geodesic line of `h * g`, pointwise; `EpsilonEridani.UpperHalfPlane.smul_range_geodesicLine` is
  the same fact at the level of the line as a set, so these lines are permuted, not merely
  mapped into each other, by the `PSL(2, ℝ)`-action.
* `EpsilonEridani.UpperHalfPlane.exists_geodesicLine_zero_eq` — a geodesic line through any prescribed
  point of `ℍ`.
