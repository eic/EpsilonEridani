# Topology of the upper half-plane

Every real point lies in the closure of the open upper half-plane, so limits taken along the
half-plane at a real point are well posed.  The half-plane is also unbounded, so the filter along
which it approaches infinity is nontrivial and limits taken along it are unique.

For a function conjugation-symmetric near infinity, decay along the upper half-plane implies
decay along the whole plane, provided it is continuous at sufficiently distant real points.

A continuous injection of the closed upper half-plane sends every real point to the frontier of
the image of the open half-plane.  The inversion `w ↦ -w⁻¹` preserves the closed upper
half-plane.

A function on the upper half-plane, extended to `ℂ` by `ofComplex`, is periodic with a real
period exactly when the original function is invariant under the corresponding translation.
