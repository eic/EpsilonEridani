# Principal powers of `z - x` on the upper half-plane

For a real number `x`, the difference `z - x` of an upper-half-plane point and `x` again has
positive imaginary part, hence lies in `Complex.slitPlane`.  The principal power
`(z - x) ^ (r : ℂ)` is therefore holomorphic and nonvanishing there, and its logarithmic
derivative is the simple fraction `r / (z - x)`.

Negating the base, replacing `z - x` by `x - z`, multiplies the power by the constant
`exp (π r i)` -- unimodular when `r` is real -- because the two bases lie on opposite sides of the
real axis.

These are the basic branch facts for a factor of a product of principal powers with real base
points, such as the Schwarz--Christoffel integrand.
