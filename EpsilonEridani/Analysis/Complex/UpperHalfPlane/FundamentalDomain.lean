# Fundamental domains for the two groups acting on `ℍ`

A congruence subgroup `Γ ≤ SL(2, ℤ)` reaches `ℍ` two ways: through its image in `PSL(2, ℤ)`, the
group that acts faithfully and the one every fundamental-domain statement about `ℍ` is phrased
for, and through `Γ.map (mapGL ℝ)` inside `GL(2, ℝ)`, the group a modular form is slashed by and
the only one large enough to contain a Hecke double-coset representative. This file records when a
fundamental domain for the first is one for the second.

There is no coercion `PSL(2, ℤ) → GL(2, ℝ)` to read that along: opposite lifts `γ` and `-γ` of one
class have distinct images under `mapGL ℝ`. What is true is that **each class acts as any of its
lifts does** — `UpperHalfPlane.pslMk_smul` and `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.pslMk_smul_set`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isFundamentalDomain_map_mapGL`: for `Γ ⊓ center = ⊥`, a fundamental domain for
  the image of `Γ` in `PSL(2, ℤ)` is one for its image in `GL(2, ℝ)`.

The hypothesis is not a convenience. Without it the statement is false: if `-I ∈ Γ` then `-I` is a
*non-identity* element of `Γ.map (mapGL ℝ)` acting *trivially* on `ℍ`, so `(-I) • S = S` and
`MeasureTheory.IsFundamentalDomain` fails its a.e.-disjointness requirement for every `S` of
positive measure. Passing to `PSL(2, ℤ)` is exactly what removes that element. `Γ ⊓ center = ⊥`
holds for `Γ₁(N)` and `Γ(N)` at every level except `N = 1` and `N = 2`, the two where `-1 ≡ 1`
(so level `0`, where the congruence is an equation in `ℤ`, is on the good side alongside `N ≥ 3`);
`SL(2, ℤ)` is the case `N = 1`, and `Γ₀(N)` fails at every level.

/-- **A fundamental domain for the image of `Γ` in `PSL(2, ℤ)` is one for its image in
`GL(2, ℝ)`**, provided `Γ` meets the centre of `SL(2, ℤ)` trivially.

Without that hypothesis the statement is false: `-I ∈ Γ` would put a non-identity element of
`Γ.map (mapGL ℝ)` acting trivially on `ℍ`, so `(-I) • S = S` and a.e.-disjointness fails for every
`S` of positive measure. The module docstring says where each side of the statement is used. -/
