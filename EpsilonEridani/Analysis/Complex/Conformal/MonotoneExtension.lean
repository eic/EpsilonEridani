# Injectivity of a monotone conformal extension

This file isolates the remaining topological input in the injectivity half of Carathéodory's
boundary correspondence. Let `F` be continuous on a closed disc, holomorphic and injective on its
interior. If every point fibre of the boundary restriction is connected, then `F` is injective on
the boundary and hence on the whole closed disc.

The proof joins two existing parts of the conformal-mapping development. Boundary uniqueness in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/ArcConstancy.lean` says that a conformal map is constant on no
relative open arc of the bounding circle, so each boundary fibre has empty interior. The monotone
Jordan-curve theorem in `EpsilonEridani/Topology/JordanCurve/Monotone.lean` then turns connectedness of the
fibres into injectivity. Finally,
`EpsilonEridani.injOn_closure_of_injOn_frontier` propagates boundary injectivity across the closed disc,
since a boundary value of a conformal map cannot also be an interior value.

For the layer **L5** Carathéodory milestone, the continuous extension is supplied by the
length–area and plane-separation argument. The result here shows that upgrading it to the requested
homeomorphism of closures needs exactly the monotonicity of its boundary restriction; it does not
assume or assert that monotonicity for an arbitrary continuous extension.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.injOn_sphere_of_isPreconnected_boundary_fiber` — a monotone boundary restriction of a
  conformal disc map is injective.
* `EpsilonEridani.injOn_sphere_iff_isPreconnected_boundary_fiber` — monotonicity of the boundary
  restriction is exactly its injectivity.
* `EpsilonEridani.injOn_closedBall_of_isPreconnected_boundary_fiber` — the extension is injective on the
  closed disc.
* `EpsilonEridani.bijOn_closedBall_closure_image_of_isPreconnected_boundary_fiber` — consequently it is a
  bijection from the closed disc onto the closure of the conformal image; the existing
  `EpsilonEridani.closureHomeomorph` packages this bijection as a homeomorphism.

/-- **A conformal disc map with a monotone boundary restriction is injective on the circle.**
Suppose `F` is continuous on `closedBall c r`, holomorphic and injective on `ball c r`, and every
point fibre of its restriction to `sphere c r` is preconnected. Then the restriction is injective.

The fibre-interior hypothesis of
`EpsilonEridani.IsJordanCurve.injective_of_isPreconnected_fiber_of_interior_fiber_eq_empty` is exactly
`EpsilonEridani.interior_setOf_eq_eq_empty_of_injOn`, the boundary uniqueness theorem for a conformal map.

/-- **For a conformal extension, boundary monotonicity is equivalent to boundary injectivity.**
Boundary uniqueness makes every point fibre interiorless, so
`EpsilonEridani.IsJordanCurve.injective_iff_isPreconnected_fiber_of_interior_fiber_eq_empty` applies to
the restriction of `F` to `sphere c r`.

This equivalence makes the outstanding geometric input in the Carathéodory injectivity argument
precise: proving that the boundary fibres are preconnected is neither weaker nor stronger than the
required boundary injectivity once the conformal and continuity hypotheses are available. -/

/-- **A conformal disc map with a monotone boundary restriction is injective on the closed
disc.** Boundary injectivity comes from
`EpsilonEridani.injOn_sphere_of_isPreconnected_boundary_fiber`; the interior and boundary images are
disjoint by conformal properness, so `EpsilonEridani.injOn_closure_of_injOn_frontier` gives injectivity on
the closure. -/
