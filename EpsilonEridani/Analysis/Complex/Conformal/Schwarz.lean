# A strict form of the Schwarz lemma

Schwarz's lemma bounds the derivative at the centre of a ball by `R₂ / R₁` when a holomorphic
map into a strictly convex complex normed space sends `ball c R₁` into `closedBall (g c) R₂`.
This file records the **strict** form: the bound is attained only by an injective map, so a
non-injective one has `‖deriv g c‖ < R₂ / R₁`.

## The argument

Mathlib's `Complex.norm_deriv_le_div_of_mapsTo_ball` gives `‖deriv g c‖ ≤ R₂ / R₁`. In the equality
case `Complex.affine_of_mapsTo_ball_of_norm_dslope_eq_div` — the equality case of Schwarz, available
for `ℂ` because it is a strictly convex space — forces `g` to be the affine map
`z ↦ g c + (z - c) • deriv g c` on the ball. The slope is a nonzero vector, having norm
`R₂ / R₁ > 0`, so that map is injective, contradicting the hypothesis.

Both radii must be positive. With `R₂ = 0` the target is the single point `g c`, so `g` is constant
and *not* injective, while the claimed bound `‖deriv g c‖ < 0` is false.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.norm_deriv_lt_div_of_not_injOn` — the strict bound.
* `EpsilonEridani.norm_deriv_lt_one_of_not_injOn` — its equal-radius form.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

The Riemann mapping theorem is being formalized upstream at
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), which proves the
L0–L3 prerequisites internally as private lemmas. The declaration here is an explicitly
**temporary shim**: delete it and refactor downstream consumers onto the exported Mathlib version
once that lands.

Schwarz's lemma gives `‖deriv g c‖ ≤ R₂ / R₁`; in the equality case the map is affine with nonzero
slope, hence injective. Both radii must be positive: for `R₂ = 0` the map is constant, so it is
not injective and the strict bound fails. -/
