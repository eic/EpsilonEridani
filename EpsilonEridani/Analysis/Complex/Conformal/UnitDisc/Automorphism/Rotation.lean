# A holomorphic automorphism of the unit disc fixing the origin is a rotation

This file records the Schwarz-lemma rigidity for the complex unit disc: a holomorphic self-map
`f` of `Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1` that admits a holomorphic left inverse which is itself a self-map
of the disc, and that fixes the origin, is a rotation `z ↦ c * z` for a constant `c` of modulus
one.  Equivalently, the rotation factor is `deriv f 0`, and such a map with derivative `1` at
the origin is the identity.  (The left inverse gives injectivity; that `f` is in fact a genuine
automorphism is part of the conclusion, since a rotation is bijective.)

The proof is the classical two-sided Schwarz argument.  Applying Mathlib's Schwarz lemma
(`Complex.norm_le_norm_of_mapsTo_ball`) to `f` and to its inverse gives `‖f z‖ = ‖z‖` on the
whole disc; the equality case of the Schwarz lemma
(`Complex.affine_of_mapsTo_ball_of_norm_dslope_eq_div`) then forces `f` to be linear.

This advances the conformal-mapping roadmap's L2 disc-automorphism target
(`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`, layer L2: "the disc automorphism group
`Aut(𝔻) = {e^{iθ}(z−a)/(1−āz)}`"); it is the rotation rigidity that pins down the automorphisms
fixing the origin, and is the step Mathlib's `Analysis/Complex/Schwarz.lean` lists as an open
TODO ("Prove that any diffeomorphism of the unit disk to itself is a Möbius map").  It reuses
Mathlib's Schwarz lemma throughout and adds no new complex-analytic input.  As with the rest of
the L0--L3 conformal-mapping material, it is coordinated with the upstream Mathlib RMT effort
leanprover-community/mathlib4#33505 and should be refactored to upstream API if that work lands a
human-curated disc-automorphism classification.

A holomorphic self-map of the open unit disc fixing the origin and admitting a holomorphic left
inverse that is itself a self-map of the disc preserves the modulus: `‖f z‖ = ‖z‖` for every
`z` in the disc.

This is the `w = 0` case of the Schwarz--Pick equality `pseudoHyperbolicExpr_map_eq`, where the
pseudo-hyperbolic expression to the origin is just the norm.

**Rotation rigidity for the unit disc.** A holomorphic self-map `f` of the open unit disc with a
holomorphic left inverse `g` that is also a self-map of the disc, fixing the origin, is a
rotation: there is a constant `c` of modulus one with `f z = c * z` throughout the disc.

The rotation factor of an origin-fixing self-map of the disc with a holomorphic self-map left
inverse is its derivative at the origin: with the hypotheses of
`exists_eqOn_const_mul_of_leftInvOn_ball_of_map_zero`, the map equals `z ↦ deriv f 0 * z` on the
disc, and `‖deriv f 0‖ = 1`.
