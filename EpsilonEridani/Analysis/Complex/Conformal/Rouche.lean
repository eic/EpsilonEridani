# Rouché's theorem

If `f` and `g` are holomorphic on a closed disc and `‖f - g‖ < ‖f‖ + ‖g‖` everywhere on the
bounding circle, then `f` and `g` have the same number of zeros inside, counted with multiplicity.
This *symmetric* hypothesis — Estermann's form of Rouché's theorem — is the one proved here; the
familiar asymmetric hypothesis `‖f - g‖ < ‖f‖` implies it, so the classical statement is a
corollary. Rouché is the first target of layer **L0 (the local-mapping engine)** of the
conformal-mapping roadmap.

The proof is the classical argument-principle one. On the circle the hypothesis forces both `f ≠ 0`
and `g ≠ 0`, so the quotient `h = g / f` is defined and nonzero there; moreover `h` avoids the
closed ray `(-∞, 0]`, since at a nonpositive real value `t` of `h` the hypothesis would read
`(1 - t)‖f‖ < (1 - t)‖f‖`. Avoiding that ray is exactly membership in `Complex.slitPlane`, where
`Complex.log` is holomorphic — so `Complex.log ∘ h` is a primitive of `logDeriv h` at every point
of the circle and `∮ logDeriv h = 0` by
`circleIntegral.integral_eq_zero_of_hasDerivWithinAt`. Splitting `logDeriv h` as
`logDeriv g - logDeriv f` (`logDeriv_div`, valid pointwise on the circle since neither function
vanishes there) turns that into `∮ logDeriv g = ∮ logDeriv f`, and the argument principle
(`EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_divisor`) converts each side into a sum of zero orders.

It is the passage to the slit plane, rather than to the disc `ball 1 1`, that buys the symmetric
hypothesis: `‖h - 1‖ < 1` says `h` lies in a disc that happens to miss the ray, whereas
`‖1 - h‖ < 1 + ‖h‖` says precisely that `h` misses the ray, and nothing more.

Note that the primitive is only ever needed *on the circle*: the lemma consuming it asks for a
`HasDerivWithinAt` there, not on a neighbourhood of the disc. That is what keeps the proof free of
any simply-connectedness or branch-construction machinery — `h` may well have zeros and poles
inside the disc, and indeed the theorem is about exactly those.

The count is expressed with Mathlib's `analyticOrderNatAt`, summed over the open disc. Care is
needed about infinite order: `analyticOrderNatAt` sends a locally identically-zero function to `0`,
and such a point is likewise absent from the support of `MeromorphicOn.divisor`, so in general the
divisor support is the set of zeros *of finite order* rather than the zero set outright. Under the
Rouché hypotheses that distinction is vacuous: the hypothesis forces `f` to be zero-free on the
circle, and `closedBall c R` is convex hence preconnected, so
`MeromorphicOn.meromorphicOrderAt_ne_top_of_isPreconnected` propagates finite order from a boundary
point to the whole disc — neither `f` nor `g` vanishes identically near any point of it.

The circle is not essential to the argument, only convenient: the second half of the file replays
it along an arbitrary closed piecewise-`C¹` curve that is null-homologous in an open set carrying
both functions, weighting each zero by the winding number of the curve about it — and there the
functions may be meromorphic, the preserved quantity becoming zeros minus poles. The homological
argument principle `EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_nullHomologous` replaces the circle one, and
the slit-plane primitive is pushed across the corners of the curve by
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.integral_deriv_smul_logDeriv_eq_zero_of_mem_slitPlane`, the curve form of the
countable-exception logarithmic-derivative FTC.

That equality of logarithmic-derivative integrals also has a purely geometric reading, obtained by
running it through `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_comp_eq_integral_logDeriv`: the two *image* curves
`f ∘ γ` and `g ∘ γ` wind equally often about the origin. That is the classical "dog on a leash"
form, and it is stronger than the counting statement, needing only analyticity at each point of the
curve — no single ambient open set, no finite `S`, no null-homology — because the vanishing of the
slit-plane integral already holds there.

That same observation is what makes the count *detect* zeros rather than merely count them:
`EpsilonEridani.finsum_analyticOrderNatAt_ball_eq_zero_iff`, from `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.Complex.ZeroCount`,
says the count vanishes exactly when the function has no zero in the open disc, so Rouché transfers
the *existence* of a zero from one function to the other. That transfer, not the numerical
equality, is how Rouché is normally used.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.rouche_symm` — the symmetric (Estermann) form: if `‖f z - g z‖ < ‖f z‖ + ‖g z‖` on
  `sphere c R`, then `f` and `g` have equal zero counts in `ball c R`.
* `EpsilonEridani.rouche` — if `‖f z - g z‖ < ‖f z‖` on `sphere c R`, then `f` and `g` have equal zero
  counts in `ball c R`, each counted with multiplicity.
* `EpsilonEridani.rouche_add` — the classical additive phrasing: if `‖g z‖ < ‖f z‖` on `sphere c R`, then
  `f` and `f + g` have equal zero counts in `ball c R`.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_mem_closedBall_ne_zero_of_forall_mem_sphere_ne_zero` — the witness those
  transfers need: a function that is zero-free on the bounding circle does not vanish identically
  on the closed disc.
* `EpsilonEridani.rouche_symm_exists_eq_zero_iff`, `EpsilonEridani.rouche_exists_eq_zero_iff`,
  `EpsilonEridani.rouche_add_exists_eq_zero_iff` — under the respective hypotheses, `f` has a zero in
  `ball c R` if and only if the function compared to it does.
* `EpsilonEridani.rouche_symm_nullHomologous` — the homology form, for meromorphic `f` and `g`: across an
  arbitrary closed piecewise-`C¹` curve, null-homologous in an open set carrying both functions,
  the enclosed zeros minus poles agree, counted by multiplicity *and* by the winding number of the
  curve about them.
* `EpsilonEridani.rouche_symm_nullHomologous_of_analyticOnNhd`, `EpsilonEridani.rouche_nullHomologous`,
  `EpsilonEridani.rouche_add_nullHomologous` — its holomorphic specialization in the same three
  phrasings as the disc statements.
* `EpsilonEridani.rouche_symm_windingNumber_comp`, `EpsilonEridani.rouche_windingNumber_comp`,
  `EpsilonEridani.rouche_add_windingNumber_comp` — the "dog on a leash" form, in the same three phrasings:
  under the symmetric, the classical, respectively the additive hypothesis along the curve, the
  image curves wind equally often about the origin.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Mathlib has no Rouché theorem. However, per the *Coordination with upstream Mathlib* section of
`ConformalMapping/README.md`, this layer overlaps
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the in-progress
human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort, which proves L0-level material (an argument
principle, Hurwitz) internally as private lemmas. **This file is therefore a temporary shim**: once
the corresponding Mathlib lemmas land, this statement should be backed by them — or deleted and its
consumers refactored — rather than maintained as an independent re-proof. What Tau Ceti adds at L0
is named, discoverable API, not first proof.

/-- **Rouché's theorem, symmetric form** (Estermann). If `f` and `g` are holomorphic on the closed
disc `closedBall c R` and `‖f z - g z‖ < ‖f z‖ + ‖g z‖` at every point `z` of the bounding circle,
then `f` and `g` have the same number of zeros in `ball c R`, each counted with multiplicity. The
hypothesis forces both functions to be zero-free on the circle, hence of finite order throughout
the disc, so every zero is genuinely counted.

The hypothesis is the strict form of the triangle inequality `‖f z - g z‖ ≤ ‖f z‖ + ‖g z‖`, so it
says exactly that `f z` and `g z` never point in *opposite* directions on the circle. It is
symmetric in `f` and `g` and strictly weaker than the classical `‖f z - g z‖ < ‖f z‖` of
`EpsilonEridani.rouche`.

The counts are the canonical finitely supported sums `∑ᶠ z ∈ ball c R, analyticOrderNatAt · z`;
no finiteness witness appears in the statement. -/

## Detecting zeros

Rouché is usually applied not to compare two counts but to transfer the *existence* of a zero. The
bridge is `EpsilonEridani.finsum_analyticOrderNatAt_ball_eq_zero_iff`: the count vanishes exactly when
there is no zero, provided the function is nonzero somewhere on the closed disc. The Rouché
hypothesis supplies that witness on the bounding circle.
-/

/-- A function that is zero-free on the bounding circle of a disc does not vanish identically on
the closed disc — the boundary point `c + R` witnesses it. The radius may be `0`, where both discs
degenerate to `{c}`. This is the shape in which
`EpsilonEridani.finsum_analyticOrderNatAt_ball_eq_zero_iff` wants the Rouché hypothesis, and it is the
same shape every zero-detection argument on a disc needs. -/

## Rouché's theorem for a null-homologous cycle

The disc statements above compare the zeros enclosed by a *circle*. The homology forms below
replace the circle by an arbitrary closed piecewise-`C¹` curve `γ`, null-homologous in an open set
`U` carrying both functions: they compare the winding-weighted counts `∑_{z ∈ S} n_z(γ) · ord z`
over a finite set `S` carrying the exceptional points. That is the form Rouché takes on a domain
that is not a disc, and the form in which the multiplicity of enclosure is visible.

At this generality the functions may be *meromorphic*, exactly as in the argument principle the
proof runs through: the quantity that is preserved is then zeros minus poles, each counted with
multiplicity and with winding number. `EpsilonEridani.rouche_symm_nullHomologous` is that statement, with
the orders supplied by the caller; `EpsilonEridani.rouche_symm_nullHomologous_of_analyticOnNhd` is the
holomorphic specialization, whose orders are read off by `analyticOrderNatAt`.

The proof is the disc one, run through `EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_nullHomologous` instead
of the circle argument principle. What changes is the vanishing step. On a circle the integral of
`logDeriv (g / f)` was killed by `circleIntegral.integral_eq_zero_of_hasDerivWithinAt`; along a
piecewise-`C¹` curve the primitive has to be pushed through the finitely many corners, which is
exactly what the countable exceptional set of `EpsilonEridani.Contour.integral_deriv_div_eq_log_sub_log`
allows; that step is contour theory rather than Rouché, and lives with the FTC it specializes, as
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.integral_deriv_smul_logDeriv_eq_zero_of_mem_slitPlane`. The geometry is unchanged:
the symmetric hypothesis confines `g / f` to `Complex.slitPlane`, where the principal `Complex.log`
is a single-valued primitive of the logarithmic derivative, so the integral is an endpoint
difference and the curve is closed.

The two are stated and proved separately because their interfaces differ, not because the disc case
is out of reach from here. It *is* reachable: analyticity on a neighbourhood of `closedBall c R`
gives, by compactness, analyticity on a slightly larger open ball `U`, in which every closed curve
is null-homologous; the zeros in `closedBall c R` are finite in number, so they can be collected
into an `S`; and the winding number of the bounding circle is `1` at each of them. What that route
costs is exactly that bookkeeping — producing `S`, evaluating the winding numbers, and converting
the resulting weighted `Finset` sum back into the `∑ᶠ` count of `EpsilonEridani.rouche_symm`, which ranges
over the whole open disc with no finiteness hypothesis. In the other direction there is no route at
all: on a general open set the zeros may accumulate at the boundary, so no finite `S` exists and
the cycle form has nothing to say.

Unlike on a circle there is no zero-*detection* corollary here, and that is not an omission: what
fails for a general cycle is the *equivalence*, not detection outright. With winding numbers of
both signs the weighted counts can cancel, so a vanishing count no longer means the function is
zero-free — `EpsilonEridani.finsum_analyticOrderNatAt_ball_eq_zero_iff`, which the disc forms use, has no
cycle analogue. The converse direction survives and needs no corollary: if the weighted count of
`f` is nonzero then by the theorem so is that of `g`, so some `z ∈ S` has nonzero winding number
and `analyticOrderNatAt g z ≠ 0`; null-homology places such a `z` in `U`, where a nonzero order
means `g z = 0`. It is the `iff` that requires a sign hypothesis on the cycle, which the disc case
supplies by winding once.

/-- **The two argument-principle integrals of a Rouché pair agree.** This is the analytic heart of
every homology form of Rouché's theorem: along a closed piecewise-`C¹` curve on which `f` and `g`
are analytic and never point in opposite directions, the contour integrals of `logDeriv f` and
`logDeriv g` coincide, because their difference is the integral of `logDeriv (g / f)` and the
symmetric hypothesis puts `g / f` in the slit plane. Nothing is assumed off the curve, so the
statement is available to the meromorphic and the holomorphic form alike. -/

/-- **Rouché's theorem for a null-homologous cycle, symmetric form** (Estermann). Let `f` and `g`
be meromorphic on an open set `U`, analytic and non-vanishing off a finite set `S`, of orders
`ordf` and `ordg` on `S`, and let `γ` be a closed piecewise-`C¹` curve in `U`, null-homologous in
`U`, missing `S`, and satisfying `‖f (γ t) - g (γ t)‖ < ‖f (γ t)‖ + ‖g (γ t)‖` along its length.
Then `f` and `g` enclose the same number of zeros minus poles, each counted with its multiplicity
*and* with the winding number of `γ` about it.

The hypothesis is the strict form of the triangle inequality `‖f z - g z‖ ≤ ‖f z‖ + ‖g z‖`, so it
says exactly that `f` and `g` never point in *opposite* directions along the curve; it is symmetric
in the two functions and strictly weaker than the classical `‖f (γ t) - g (γ t)‖ < ‖f (γ t)‖`.

Exactly as in `EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_nullHomologous`, points of `S` outside `U` are
harmless rather than excluded — null-homology makes their winding number, hence their contribution
on either side, vanish — so the meromorphy and order hypotheses are conditional on membership in
`U`, and `S` may list ordinary points, of order `0`.

`EpsilonEridani.rouche_symm` is the circle case, proved separately: see the section introduction for how
the two interfaces differ and what recovering the disc statement from this one would take. -/

/-- **Rouché's theorem for a null-homologous cycle**, holomorphic form. Let `f` and `g` be analytic
on an open set `U` with all their zeros in a finite set `S`, and let `γ` be a closed piecewise-`C¹`
curve in `U`, null-homologous in `U`, along which `‖f (γ t) - g (γ t)‖ < ‖f (γ t)‖ + ‖g (γ t)‖`.
Then `f` and `g` have the same zero count enclosed by `γ`, each zero counted with its multiplicity
and with the winding number of `γ` about it.

The curve is not required to miss `S`: the hypothesis already forces both functions to be zero-free
along it, so it may run through the non-zeros that `S` happens to list. This is the holomorphic
specialization of `EpsilonEridani.rouche_symm_nullHomologous`, with the orders read off by
`analyticOrderNatAt` instead of supplied by the caller. -/

/-- **Rouché's theorem as an equality of image winding numbers, symmetric form** — the "dog on a
leash" statement. If `f` and `g` are analytic along a closed piecewise-`C¹` curve `γ` and never
point in opposite directions there, the image curves `f ∘ γ` and `g ∘ γ` wind equally often about
the origin.

Read through `EpsilonEridani.argumentPrinciple_windingNumber_of_analyticOnNhd`, this is the geometric face
of `EpsilonEridani.rouche_symm_nullHomologous_of_analyticOnNhd`; on its own it is *stronger*, since apart
from analyticity at each point of the curve — `AnalyticAt`, hence on some neighbourhood of that
point — only the behaviour of the two functions **along the curve** enters: no single ambient open
set carrying both, no confinement of the zeros to a finite set, and no null-homology. That is
because the equality of the two logarithmic-derivative integrals is already forced by the
hypothesis: it
puts `g / f` in `Complex.slitPlane`, where `Complex.log` is a single-valued primitive. It is only
in *counting* the winding that those extra hypotheses are needed. -/
