# The Riemann map as a conformal partial homeomorphism

The Riemann mapping theorem in `RiemannMapping/Existence.lean` produces a holomorphic bijection
between a simply connected proper domain and the open unit disc, together with a holomorphic
inverse. This file packages the same result as an `OpenPartialHomeomorph ℂ ℂ`. Its source and
target are exactly the domain and the disc, and both it and its inverse are holomorphic and
conformal on those sets.

This is the packaged-equivalence and `ConformalAt` companion required by the generality bar in
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`: the roadmap asks that the unbundled Riemann-map
statement be accompanied by the natural equivalence and conformality API.

## Main result

* `EpsilonEridani.riemannMapping_openPartialHomeomorph` — a Riemann map packaged with its inverse,
  source, target, holomorphy, and conformality.
* `EpsilonEridani.riemannMapping_homeomorph` — the resulting homeomorphism
  `Ω ≃ₜ Complex.UnitDisc`.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

The Riemann mapping theorem is being formalized upstream in
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505). This L3 theorem is
an explicitly temporary shim: delete it and refactor consumers to the public human-curated
Mathlib theorem and packaging once those land.

/-- **The Riemann mapping theorem as a homeomorphism.** A simply connected open proper subset of
`ℂ`, regarded as a subtype, is homeomorphic to `Complex.UnitDisc`.

The homeomorphism is induced by the holomorphic bijection supplied by `EpsilonEridani.riemannMapping`;
its forward and inverse formulas are
`DifferentiableOn.toHomeomorphOfBijOn_apply` and
`DifferentiableOn.toHomeomorphOfBijOn_symm_apply`. -/
