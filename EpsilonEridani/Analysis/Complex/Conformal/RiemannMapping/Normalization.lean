# The normalized Riemann map

The Riemann mapping theorem of `RiemannMapping/Existence.lean` produces *some* biholomorphism of a
simply connected proper domain onto the unit disc, and `RiemannMapping/Uniqueness.lean` shows any
two such maps differ by a disc automorphism. Neither statement singles out a map. This file adds
the classical normalization that does: fixing a base point `z₀ ∈ Ω`, there is exactly one
biholomorphism `Ω → 𝔻` with

`f z₀ = 0` and `deriv f z₀ > 0`,

the second condition being an inequality in the scoped order `ComplexOrder` on `ℂ`, so that it says
precisely that `deriv f z₀` is a *positive real number*. With `Ω` and `z₀` fixed, this pins the
Riemann map down on `Ω`: the maps here are total functions `ℂ → ℂ`, whose values off `Ω` no
condition constrains, and what is proved is that any two normalized maps agree *on* `Ω` — that is,
that the biholomorphism `Ω → 𝔻` they restrict to is unique.

## The argument

Both halves reduce to the existing ones by a rotation.

* **Existence.** The extremal map of `ExtremalFamily.lean` is already a bijection onto the disc
  sending `z₀` to `0` (`Koebe.lean` supplies the surjectivity), and its derivative `c` at `z₀` is
  nonzero. Multiplying it by the unimodular constant `‖c‖ / c` leaves both of those properties
  intact — rotations preserve the disc — and turns the derivative at `z₀` into `‖c‖ > 0`.
* **Uniqueness.** Two normalized maps differ by a rotation `u` of the disc by
  `EpsilonEridani.exists_eqOn_const_mul_of_image_eq_ball_of_apply_eq_zero`. Differentiating at `z₀` gives
  `deriv g z₀ = u * deriv f z₀` with both derivatives positive reals of the same modulus, so `u = 1`
  and the two maps agree on `Ω`.

## A note on "normalized"

`EpsilonEridani.IsPointedDiscInjectionOn` in `ExtremalFamily.lean` deliberately avoids the word
*normalized*, reserving it for the schlicht-function normalization `deriv f z₀ = 1`. The
normalization used here is the other classical one, the *Riemann-map* normalization
`f z₀ = 0`, `deriv f z₀ > 0` of Ahlfors, Ch. 6 §1: it is the one that is achievable for every
domain, since the size of `deriv f z₀` is not free once the image is required to be the unit disc.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.IsNormalizedRiemannMapOn` — the normalization, as a predicate.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_isNormalizedRiemannMapOn` — existence of the normalized Riemann map.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsNormalizedRiemannMapOn.eqOn` — uniqueness: two normalized maps agree on the domain.
* `EpsilonEridani.riemannMapping_normalized` — the two combined.
* `EpsilonEridani.eqOn_id_of_isNormalizedRiemannMapOn_ball` — the normalized Riemann map of the disc at
  the origin is the identity.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

The Riemann mapping theorem is being formalized upstream at
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), which proves the
L0–L3 prerequisites internally as private lemmas. As with the rest of this development's L0–L3
material, the declarations here are an explicitly **temporary shim**: delete them and refactor
downstream consumers onto the exported Mathlib versions once those land.

/-- A **normalized Riemann map** of a domain `Ω` at a base point `z₀ ∈ Ω`: a holomorphic bijection
of `Ω` onto the open unit disc that sends `z₀` to the origin and has a *positive real* derivative
there.

The order on `deriv f z₀` is the scoped `ComplexOrder` one, so `0 < deriv f z₀` unfolds to
`0 < (deriv f z₀).re ∧ 0 = (deriv f z₀).im`.

This normalization is what makes the Riemann map unique: `EpsilonEridani.riemannMapping` produces a map
only up to a disc automorphism, whereas by `EpsilonEridani.riemannMapping_normalized` any two functions
satisfying the predicate below agree on `Ω`. Uniqueness can only be uniqueness on `Ω`, since the
predicate says nothing about the values of `f` outside `Ω`. -/

`Ω → 𝔻`, not the values of a representative off `Ω`. Note that neither simple connectivity nor
properness of `Ω` is needed here: uniqueness holds wherever two such maps happen to exist. -/
