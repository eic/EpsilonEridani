# Fixed points of holomorphic self-maps of the unit disc

A holomorphic self-map of the open unit disc that fixes **two** distinct points of the disc is
the identity (`EpsilonEridani.eqOn_id_of_isFixedPt_of_isFixedPt`); equivalently, the fixed-point set in
the open unit disc of any self-map other than the identity is a subsingleton
(`EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_inter_fixedPoints_of_not_eqOn_id`), which read hypothesis-free is the
dichotomy that a self-map is either the identity or fixes at most one point of the disc
(`EpsilonEridani.eqOn_id_or_subsingleton_inter_fixedPoints`).

This generalises `EpsilonEridani.eq_one_of_mem_unitDiscAut_of_isFixedPt` of
`UnitDisc/Automorphism/Parametrization.lean`, which says the same for a member of `Aut(𝔻)`, from
automorphisms to arbitrary holomorphic self-maps.

## The argument

The automorphism case is exactly what the proof runs on.  Two fixed points make the
Schwarz--Pick contraction estimate an equality at that pair of points for a trivial reason —
both sides are the same pseudo-hyperbolic expression — so the classification form of
Schwarz--Pick rigidity,
`exists_forall_unitDisc_eq_unitDiscStandardAutomorphismEquiv_of_pseudoHyperbolicExpr_map_eq`
of `SchwarzPick/Rigidity.lean`, turns `f` into a standard disc automorphism
`ζ ↦ u * (ζ - b) / (1 - conj b * ζ)`.  Its two fixed points then force it to be the identity of
`Aut(𝔻)` by the already-merged automorphism statement.

## Generality

In accordance with the generality bar of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, which fixes scalar `ℂ`
for every theorem added in layers L0--L6, everything below is stated for maps of `ℂ`, matching
the rest of `Conformal/SchwarzPick/`.  The hypothesis `Function.IsFixedPt f a` is Mathlib's
spelling of `f a = a`, as in `EpsilonEridani.eq_one_of_mem_unitDiscAut_of_isFixedPt`.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Per the *Coordination with upstream Mathlib* section of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, the
L0--L3 material of this roadmap overlaps the in-progress human-curated Riemann-mapping effort
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), which proves its
prerequisites internally as private lemmas; Mathlib's `Analysis/Complex/Schwarz.lean` and
`Analysis/Complex/BranchLogRoot.lean` are the preceding human-curated work.  This file is
therefore a **temporary shim** in the same sense as the rest of `Conformal/SchwarzPick/`: should
a human-curated fixed-point form of Schwarz--Pick land upstream, these statements are to be
backed by it, or deleted and their consumers refactored onto it.

If `f` is differentiable on the open unit ball `ball (0 : ℂ) 1`, maps that ball into itself and
fixes two distinct points `z ≠ w` of it, then `f` agrees with the identity on the whole ball.
This is `EpsilonEridani.eq_one_of_mem_unitDiscAut_of_isFixedPt` with its hypothesis weakened from
membership in `Aut(𝔻)` to an arbitrary holomorphic self-map. -/
