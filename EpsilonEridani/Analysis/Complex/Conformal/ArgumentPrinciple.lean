# The argument principle in winding-number form

The argument principle is normally *stated* as an equality of contour integrals — the integral of
`f'/f` along a cycle equals `2πi` times the winding-weighted count of zeros minus poles — and that
is the form the sibling contour-integration development supplies
(`EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_nullHomologous`). The name, though, comes from a *geometric*
reading of the same identity: `∮_γ f'/f` measures the total change of `arg (f z)` as `z` traverses
`γ`, so what the identity computes is **how often the image curve `f ∘ γ` winds around the
origin**. This file supplies that reading, and it is what turns the argument principle into a
statement about the geometry of the image rather than about an integral.

The bridge is `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_comp_eq_integral_logDeriv`, supplied by the contour
layer alongside the rest of the logarithmic-derivative machinery: along a piecewise-`C¹` curve `γ`
on which `f` is analytic and zero-free, the composite `f ∘ γ` is itself a curve missing the origin,
and its index integral `(2πi)⁻¹ ∮_{f ∘ γ} dw / w` is, after the substitution `w = f z`, exactly
`(2πi)⁻¹ ∮_γ f'/f`.

Feeding the bridge into the homological argument principle gives the geometric statements. For `f`
meromorphic on an open `U` with its zeros and poles confined to a finite `S`, and `γ` closed and
null-homologous in `U`,

`n_0(f ∘ γ) = ∑_{z ∈ S} n_z(γ) · ord_z f`,

the winding number of the image about the origin being the winding-weighted number of zeros minus
poles. The holomorphic case is recorded separately, with the orders read off by
`analyticOrderNatAt` instead of supplied by the caller.

Nothing here re-proves the argument principle. Layer **L0** of the conformal-mapping roadmap is
directed to *consume* the residue and argument-principle material of the sibling
contour-integration roadmap, and that is what happens: the analytic content is
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_nullHomologous` and the corner-tolerant logarithmic-derivative
regularity of `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.Contour.LogDerivFTC`, and what is added on top is the
conformal-geometric reading. `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Rouche.lean` consumes it in turn
to state Rouché's theorem as an equality of image winding numbers — the "dog on a leash" form.

The generalized winding number of `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber` is a *complex* number, defined by
a principal value, so no integrality is asserted anywhere below; the identity is an identity of
complex numbers, exactly as the underlying argument principle is.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.argumentPrinciple_windingNumber` — **the argument principle, geometric form**: for `f`
  meromorphic with orders `ord` on a finite `S` and `γ` null-homologous, the image curve winds
  `∑_{z ∈ S} n_z(γ) · ord z` times about the origin.
* `EpsilonEridani.argumentPrinciple_windingNumber_of_analyticOnNhd` — the holomorphic case, with the orders
  read off by `analyticOrderNatAt`.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Per the *Coordination with upstream Mathlib* section of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, layer L0
overlaps [mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the
in-progress human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort, which proves an argument principle
internally as a private lemma
(`circleIntegral_logDeriv_eq_finsum_analyticOrderNatAdd`). **This file is therefore a temporary
shim**: once the corresponding Mathlib lemmas land, these statements should be backed by them — or
deleted and their consumers refactored — rather than maintained as an independent re-proof. What
Tau Ceti adds at L0 is named, discoverable API, not first proof.

/-- **The argument principle, geometric form.** Let `U` be open, `S` a finite set collecting every
zero and pole of `f` in `U`: `f` is analytic and non-vanishing at each point of `U ∖ S`, and
meromorphic of order `ord s` at each `s ∈ S` lying in `U`. Let `γ` be a closed piecewise-`C¹` curve
in `U`, **null-homologous** in `U`, that **avoids** `S`. Then the image curve `f ∘ γ` misses the
origin and winds around it exactly

`n_0(f ∘ γ) = ∑_{z ∈ S} n_z(γ) · ord z`

times: the number of zeros minus poles enclosed by `γ`, each counted with its multiplicity and with
the winding number of `γ` about it.

This is the reading that names the theorem — the total change of `arg (f z)` along `γ`, divided by
`2π` — and it is `EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_nullHomologous` read through
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_comp_eq_integral_logDeriv`. As there, points of `S` outside `U` are
harmless: null-homology makes their winding number, hence their contribution, vanish. -/

/-- **The argument principle, geometric form, for a holomorphic function.** Let `f` be analytic on
an open `U` with all its zeros in a finite set `S`, and let `γ` be a closed piecewise-`C¹` curve in
`U`, null-homologous in `U`, along which `f` does not vanish. Then

`n_0(f ∘ γ) = ∑_{z ∈ S} n_z(γ) · analyticOrderNatAt f z`:

the image curve winds around the origin as often as `γ` encloses zeros of `f`, counted with
multiplicity.

Only the *zeros* need be avoided, not all of `S`: `S` may list points where `f` does not vanish,
and `γ` is free to run through them, their order — and so their term in the sum — being `0`. This
is the pole-free specialisation of `EpsilonEridani.argumentPrinciple_windingNumber`, with the orders read
off by `analyticOrderNatAt` instead of supplied by the caller. -/
