# Vitali's convergence theorem

Vitali's theorem upgrades pointwise convergence on a set with an accumulation point to locally
uniform convergence for a locally bounded sequence of holomorphic functions. This completes the
Vitali component of layer **L1 (normal families / Montel)** of the conformal-mapping roadmap.

The proof applies `EpsilonEridani.montel` twice. First choose one locally uniform subsequential limit `g`.
For an arbitrary subsequence, Montel supplies a further locally uniform limit `q`. Both limits
agree on the pointwise convergence set, hence on the whole preconnected domain by Mathlib's
analytic identity theorem
`AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_frequently_eq`. Thus every subsequence has a further
subsequence converging to `g`; the sequential convergence criterion, applied to continuous maps on
each compact subset, gives locally uniform convergence of the original sequence.

When the sequence already converges pointwise on the *whole* of `Ω`, none of that machinery is
needed. Local boundedness makes the sequence equicontinuous on `Ω`
(`EpsilonEridani.IsLocallyBoundedOn.equicontinuousOn`, the Cauchy-estimate half of Montel's theorem), and
on an equicontinuous family pointwise convergence *is* uniform convergence on each compact subset,
by Mathlib's Arzelà–Ascoli lemma `Equicontinuous.tendsto_uniformFun_iff_pi`. This is why the
whole-domain statements below are not corollaries of `EpsilonEridani.vitali`: they spend no identity
theorem, hence need neither an accumulation point nor connectivity of `Ω`, and no selection
theorem, hence do not run on `EpsilonEridani.montel` at all.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.vitali` — a locally bounded sequence of holomorphic functions on an open *preconnected*
  `Ω` which converges pointwise on a set with an accumulation point in the domain converges locally
  uniformly to a holomorphic function.
* `EpsilonEridani.vitali_of_tendsto` — the same theorem with a prescribed pointwise limit on the
  convergence set.
* `EpsilonEridani.tendstoLocallyUniformlyOn_of_isLocallyBoundedOn_of_forall_tendsto` — a locally bounded
  sequence of holomorphic functions converging pointwise on the whole of `Ω` converges to that
  limit **locally uniformly**: on such a sequence, pointwise convergence and locally uniform
  convergence are the same thing.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_differentiableOn_tendstoLocallyUniformlyOn_of_isLocallyBoundedOn` — its
  existential companion, for a consumer who knows the sequence converges at each point of `Ω`
  without a name for the limit.

Holomorphy of such a pointwise limit, and termwise differentiation along it, are then Mathlib's
`TendstoLocallyUniformlyOn.differentiableOn` and `TendstoLocallyUniformlyOn.deriv` applied to the
third of these.

## The scalar target

Unlike the estimates of `Conformal/NormalFamilies.lean` and the Montel results they feed, which
are stated for a target complex normed space `E`, this file keeps the roadmap's scalar target `ℂ`.
For `EpsilonEridani.vitali` the reason is the proof: it runs `EpsilonEridani.montel`, which is genuinely false
for a target that is not proper, so an `E`-valued version of that argument would prove only the
finite-dimensional case. Vitali's theorem does hold for an arbitrary Banach target (Arendt and
Nikolski, *Vector-valued holomorphic functions revisited*, Math. Z. **234** (2000), §2), but by a
different argument — convergence of the Taylor coefficients at an accumulation point, and a clopen
propagation — so that generality is a separate theorem rather than a weakening of this one. The
whole-domain statements spend no selection theorem, so their argument is target-agnostic; they too
are stated at `ℂ`, the generality the conformal-mapping roadmap sets for the theorems this entry
adds and the one at which its consumers use them.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Per the *Coordination with upstream Mathlib* section of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, L0–L3
material overlaps [mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505).
This file is therefore a **temporary shim**: if a human-curated Vitali theorem lands in Mathlib,
this statement should be backed by it, or deleted and its consumers refactored to the upstream API.
Mathlib's `TendstoLocallyUniformlyOn.differentiableOn`, its identity theorem and its Arzelà–Ascoli
framework are consumed rather than restated.

/-! ### Pointwise convergence on the whole domain -/

/-- **On a locally bounded sequence of holomorphic functions, pointwise convergence is locally
uniform convergence.** If a locally bounded sequence of holomorphic functions on an open `Ω`
converges pointwise at every point of `Ω`, it converges locally uniformly to that pointwise limit.

This is not a case of `EpsilonEridani.vitali`, which asks `Ω` preconnected in order to propagate an
identification made on a small set `A` to the whole domain: here the identification is available at
every point already, so the identity theorem — and with it the connectivity — is not needed. The
converse implication is immediate, locally uniform convergence being pointwise convergence at each
point of `Ω`.

Neither is it a case of `EpsilonEridani.montel`: only the equicontinuity half of Montel's theorem is
spent, not the selection theorem. On a compact `K ⊆ Ω` local boundedness makes the
restricted sequence equicontinuous (`EpsilonEridani.IsLocallyBoundedOn.equicontinuousOn`), and on an
equicontinuous family the topology of uniform convergence and the topology of pointwise convergence
have the same convergent sequences, which is Mathlib's Arzelà–Ascoli lemma
`Equicontinuous.tendsto_uniformFun_iff_pi`. -/

/-- **The pointwise limit need not be named.** A locally bounded sequence of holomorphic functions
on an open `Ω` which converges at each point of `Ω` converges locally uniformly on `Ω` to a
holomorphic function — the existential companion of the statement above, in the shape
`EpsilonEridani.vitali` takes on a subset `A`.

The limit is `fun z => limUnder atTop fun n => F n z`, which the hypothesis identifies as the
pointwise limit on `Ω`; no connectivity of `Ω` and no accumulation point is involved, exactly as
above, and holomorphy of the limit is `TendstoLocallyUniformlyOn.differentiableOn`. -/
