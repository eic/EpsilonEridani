# The Schwarz reflection principle across the real axis

This file proves the summit of the conformal-mapping roadmap's Schwarz-reflection layer (L4 in
`ConformalMapping/README.md`, the `sorry`-goal stated in `ConformalMapping/Suggested.lean`): on a
conjugation-symmetric open set `Ω`, a function that is continuous on the closed upper part,
holomorphic on the open upper part, and real on `Ω ∩ ℝ` extends *holomorphically* across the real
axis. The extension is the explicit witness `schwarzReflection f` from `Reflection/Basic.lean`,
whose gluing calculus (continuity on all of `Ω`, holomorphy off the axis, the derivative formulas
and the conjugation symmetry) is already established there. What remains — and is proved here — is
holomorphy *at* the axis — and that is exactly Painlevé removability of the real axis,
`EpsilonEridani.differentiableOn_of_continuousOn_of_differentiableOn_im_ne_zero` from
`Conformal/Removability/Basic.lean`, where the Morera argument that supplies it is proved. So the
reflection principle is now a two-line consequence of the two halves of its input: continuity of
the extension across the axis, and holomorphy off it.

As with the rest of the L0–L3/L4 conformal-mapping material, this is coordinated with the upstream
Mathlib Riemann-mapping effort leanprover-community/mathlib4#33505; L4 (reflection) is not part of
that draft, so this is genuinely new Lean formalization, but any shared foundational API should be
refactored to Mathlib's once it lands.

/-- **Schwarz reflection principle (real axis).** On a conjugation-symmetric open set `Ω`, if `f`
is continuous on the closed upper part, holomorphic on the open upper part, and real-valued on
the real axis of `Ω`, then the explicit reflection extension `schwarzReflection f` is holomorphic
on all of `Ω` — in particular across the real axis.

The gluing calculus (continuity everywhere, holomorphy off the axis, the conjugation symmetry) is
`Reflection/Basic.lean`; the missing holomorphy at the axis is Painlevé removability,
`differentiableOn_of_continuousOn_of_differentiableOn_im_ne_zero`. -/

/-- **Schwarz reflection principle**, packaged existential form (the L4 milestone of
`ConformalMapping/Suggested.lean`). On a conjugation-symmetric open `Ω`, a function continuous on
the closed upper part, holomorphic on the open upper part, and real on the real axis extends to a
function holomorphic on all of `Ω` that agrees with `f` on the closed upper part and satisfies the
reflection symmetry `F (conj z) = conj (F z)`. The explicit witness is `schwarzReflection f`. -/
