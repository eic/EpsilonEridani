# The pre-Schwarzian derivative along a straight boundary arc

A holomorphic function whose boundary values on a real interval run along an affine line continues
across that interval by Schwarz reflection, and the continuation `F` intertwines conjugation with
the reflection in the target line: `F (conj z) = τ (F z)`. Every reflection in a line of direction
`b` has the affine shape `τ w = c + u * conj w` with `u = b / conj b`, and this file draws out what
that shape forces on the derivatives of `F`.

Differentiating the identity once removes the additive constant, so `deriv F` satisfies the same
identity with `c = 0`; differentiating a second time leaves that identity unchanged. The factor `u`
therefore cancels from the quotient `deriv (deriv F) / deriv F`, the **pre-Schwarzian derivative**
`logDeriv (deriv F)`, which obeys the bare conjugation symmetry
`logDeriv (deriv F) (conj z) = conj (logDeriv (deriv F) z)` and is consequently *real on the real
axis*. Nothing about the target line survives into that conclusion; only the source line is
remembered. What the target line does control is `deriv F` itself, which on the real axis is a real
multiple of the direction `b`: the boundary arc runs along the target line.

Differentiability of `F` is not needed for any of this. The identity is an equality between
`deriv`s, and `deriv` of a function that is not differentiable at a point is `0` there, which
satisfies the identity as well.

These are the local statements the Schwarz--Christoffel formula needs in its converse direction. A
conformal map of the upper half-plane onto a polygon carries each boundary interval between two
consecutive prevertices into one side, hence has real pre-Schwarzian there. When the map is also
injective up to that interval and sends the upper half-plane to one side of the side's line, the
reflected extension is injective, so its derivative does not vanish on the interval and its
pre-Schwarzian is holomorphic across it. Assembling those intervals, the pre-Schwarzian continues to
a conjugation-symmetric function holomorphic on the plane minus the prevertices
(`EpsilonEridani.exists_differentiableOn_eqOn_logDeriv_deriv`). Reading off its poles at the prevertices
is what identifies it with `∑ i, e i / (z - a i)`, the pre-Schwarzian derivative of the
Schwarz--Christoffel map (`EpsilonEridani.logDeriv_deriv_schwarzChristoffelPrimitive`).

The source line is the real axis throughout, as in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Reflection/Basic.lean`: unlike holomorphy, the pre-Schwarzian
derivative is not invariant under an affine change of the source coordinate -- precomposing with
`w ↦ p + a * w` multiplies it by `a` -- so a general source line would only move that factor into
the statement, and the real axis is the coordinate the Schwarz--Christoffel prevertices live in.
The target line is arbitrary, since a polygon's sides are.

The abstract statements assume only the reflection identity, and so apply to any extension however
obtained. The concrete ones are about the explicit witness
`EpsilonEridani.lineSchwarzReflection 0 1 q b f` of the reflection principle across the real axis with an
arbitrary target line; its holomorphy and its agreement with `f` on the closed upper half-plane are
`EpsilonEridani.differentiableOn_lineSchwarzReflection_of_symmetric` and
`EpsilonEridani.lineSchwarzReflection_of_coord_im_nonneg`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.deriv_conj_eq_mul_conj_deriv` and
  `EpsilonEridani.deriv_deriv_conj_eq_mul_conj_deriv_deriv` -- the first and second derivatives of a
  function intertwining conjugation with an affine reflection satisfy the same intertwining
  relation, with the additive constant gone.
* `EpsilonEridani.logDeriv_deriv_conj_eq_conj_logDeriv_deriv` -- the pre-Schwarzian derivative
  intertwines conjugation with conjugation.
* `EpsilonEridani.im_logDeriv_deriv_eq_zero` -- so it is real on the real axis.
* `EpsilonEridani.im_div_deriv_lineSchwarzReflection_eq_zero` -- on the real axis the derivative of the
  reflected extension is a real multiple of the direction of the target line.
* `EpsilonEridani.im_logDeriv_deriv_lineSchwarzReflection_eq_zero` -- the pre-Schwarzian derivative of
  the reflected extension is real on the real axis.
* `EpsilonEridani.eqOn_logDeriv_deriv_lineSchwarzReflection` -- it extends the pre-Schwarzian derivative
  of the original branch.
* `EpsilonEridani.logDeriv_deriv_lineSchwarzReflection_conj` -- it is conjugation-symmetric.
* `EpsilonEridani.differentiableOn_logDeriv_deriv_lineSchwarzReflection` -- for an injective branch
  mapping the upper half-plane to one side of the target line, it is holomorphic across the axis.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_differentiableOn_eqOn_logDeriv_deriv` -- the pre-Schwarzian derivative of a map
  of the upper half-plane with straight boundary arcs away from a set `S` continues to a
  conjugation-symmetric function holomorphic away from the real points of `S`.

/-- **The pre-Schwarzian derivative continues across straight boundary arcs.** Let `f` be
holomorphic with nonvanishing derivative on the open upper half-plane, and suppose that near every
real point outside `S` it extends continuously and injectively to the real axis, with boundary
values on a line and the nearby upper half-plane mapped strictly to one side of that line. Then
the pre-Schwarzian derivative `logDeriv (deriv f)` continues to a function holomorphic away from
the real points of `S` and symmetric under conjugation.

This is the situation of a conformal map of the upper half-plane onto a polygon, with `S` the set
of prevertices: each boundary interval between consecutive prevertices is carried into one side of
the polygon. The continuation is in fact holomorphic at every non-real point; the theorem permits
exceptions only at the real points of `S`. -/
