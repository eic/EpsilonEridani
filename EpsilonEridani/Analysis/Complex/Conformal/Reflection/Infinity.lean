# Decay of a reflected pre-Schwarzian at infinity

Suppose that the inverse coordinate `g(w) = f(-1 / w)` of a conformal map extends continuously
and injectively to a straight boundary edge through `w = 0`. Normalize the target edge to the
real axis, with the interior on its upper side. Schwarz reflection extends `g` holomorphically
across zero with nonzero derivative. The pre-Schwarzian chain rule then gives
`z * f''(z) / f'(z) → -2` along the upper half-plane, and in particular `f'' / f' → 0`.

The final theorem transfers this decay to any conjugation-symmetric continuation of the
pre-Schwarzian which is continuous near infinity. It supplies the full-plane limit needed in
the partial-fraction characterization of the Schwarz--Christoffel differential equation.
The straight-edge hypotheses concern the map in the inverse coordinate, rather than assuming
any differentiability of that map on the boundary.  A second form of the decay theorem is stated
for the original map, whose normalized inverse coordinate is the one assumed to extend across
zero.

/-- **Decay of a continued pre-Schwarzian derivative at infinity.** Read the map `f` of the upper
half-plane in the coordinate `w ↦ -1 / w` at infinity and normalize the target by `w ↦ (w - q) / b`.
If the result extends to a function `g` which is continuous and injective up to a real segment
through `0`, holomorphic and upper half-plane valued above it, and real on it, then every
conjugation-symmetric continuation `φ` of the pre-Schwarzian derivative of `f` which is continuous
near infinity on the real axis tends to `0` at infinity.

This is the form the Schwarz--Christoffel converse uses: `φ` is holomorphic off the finitely many
prevertices, so it is automatically continuous near infinity, and the hypotheses on `g` say that
the point at infinity is an interior point of a side of the polygon. -/
