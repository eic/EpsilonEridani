# The extremal problem of the Riemann mapping theorem

The Riemann mapping theorem is proved by solving an extremal problem: among all holomorphic
injections of a domain `Ω` into the unit disc that send a chosen base point `z₀` to the origin,
maximize `‖deriv · z₀‖`. This file introduces that competing family and shows the maximum is
**attained**.

The sibling file `DiscInjection.lean` supplies the family's nonemptiness; this file supplies
compactness. Together they set up the Koebe square-root argument, which shows that a maximizer
cannot omit a value — that step is not in this file.

## The argument

Cauchy's estimate on a closed ball inside `Ω` bounds `‖deriv f z₀‖` by `1 / r` uniformly over the
family, so the supremum `M` is finite; it is positive because the family is nonempty and an
injective holomorphic map has nonvanishing derivative. Along a maximizing sequence, Montel's
selection theorem extracts a locally uniformly convergent subsequence. Its limit `g` inherits every
defining property:

* holomorphy, from Montel;
* `g z₀ = 0` and `‖deriv g z₀‖ = M`, by passing to the limit pointwise — the derivatives converge
  locally uniformly too, by the Weierstrass convergence theorem;
* injectivity, from Hurwitz's theorem for injectivity (`EpsilonEridani.hurwitz_injOn`); the competing
  alternative, that `g` is constant, is excluded because `‖deriv g z₀‖ = M > 0`;
* mapping into the **open** disc. This is the one property that does not pass to the limit for
  free: a locally uniform limit of maps into `ball 0 1` a priori only lands in `closedBall 0 1`.
  A boundary value would make `‖g‖` attain an interior maximum, so the maximum modulus principle
  would force `‖g‖ ≡ 1` on `Ω`, contradicting `g z₀ = 0`.

## Attribution and upstream coordination

The Riemann mapping theorem is being formalized upstream at
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), which proves the
L0–L3 prerequisites internally as private lemmas. The declarations here are an explicitly
**temporary shim**: delete them and refactor downstream consumers onto the exported Mathlib
versions once those land.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.IsPointedDiscInjectionOn` — membership in the competing family.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_isPointedDiscInjectionOn` — the family is nonempty.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_isMaxOn_norm_deriv` — the extremal problem has a solution, given one competitor.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_isMaxOn_norm_deriv_of_isSimplyConnected` — the form used by the Riemann mapping
  theorem, where simple connectivity supplies that competitor.

/-- A **pointed disc injection** on `Ω` at the base point `z₀`: a holomorphic injection of `Ω`
into the open unit disc sending `z₀` to the origin. It is the pointed form of the maps produced by
`EpsilonEridani.exists_differentiableOn_injOn_mapsTo_unitBall` in `DiscInjection.lean`.

Such maps are classically called *schlicht*, the traditional name for an injective holomorphic map;
the name here deliberately avoids *normalized*, which conventionally demands the further
normalization `deriv f z₀ = 1` that this predicate does not impose.

This is the competing family of the Riemann mapping theorem's extremal problem: the theorem is
proved by maximizing `‖deriv f z₀‖` over all such `f`. -/

/-- **The extremal problem has a solution.** If the competing family at a base point `z₀` of an
open preconnected set `Ω` is nonempty, then some member maximizes `‖deriv · z₀‖` over the whole
family.

The compactness argument needs nothing beyond these hypotheses: preconnectedness for the maximum
modulus principle and for Hurwitz's theorem, and one competitor to make the supremum positive.
Simple connectivity enters only through
`EpsilonEridani.exists_isPointedDiscInjectionOn`, which supplies that competitor; see the corollary
`EpsilonEridani.exists_isMaxOn_norm_deriv_of_isSimplyConnected`.

This is the compactness half of the Riemann mapping theorem. It does **not** assert that the
maximizer is surjective; that is the Koebe square-root argument, proved elsewhere. -/
