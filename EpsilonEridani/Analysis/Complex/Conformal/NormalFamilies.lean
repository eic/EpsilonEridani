# Normal families: equicontinuity of a locally bounded family of holomorphic functions

A family of holomorphic functions on an open set `U ⊆ ℂ` that is *locally bounded* — uniformly
bounded on every compact subset of `U` — is automatically equicontinuous on `U`.  This is the
analytic heart of Montel's normal-families theorem: combined with Arzelà--Ascoli and an
exhaustion/diagonal argument, it yields precompactness for local uniform convergence.

The estimates here are stated for maps `ℂ → E` into a complex normed space, because nothing in a
Cauchy estimate uses the multiplicative structure of the target: Mathlib's
`Complex.norm_deriv_le_of_forall_mem_sphere_norm_le`, which is the sole analytic input, is itself
`E`-valued.  Only `EpsilonEridani.IsLocallyBoundedOn.equicontinuousOn_deriv` needs `E` complete, and
that is because it differentiates twice.  Taking `E = ℂ` recovers the scalar statements.

Local boundedness itself is a statement about compact subsets of the domain and about `‖·‖`
alone: it mentions neither holomorphy nor the complex structure of either side.  So
`EpsilonEridani.IsLocallyBoundedOn` and its elementary API are stated for a family of maps `X → E` from
an arbitrary topological space into a type with a norm.  The domain specialises to `ℂ`, and the
target acquires its normed complex vector space structure, exactly where holomorphy is first
assumed: at the Cauchy estimates below.

The mechanism is Cauchy's estimate for the first derivative.  Mathlib's
`Complex.norm_deriv_le_of_forall_mem_sphere_norm_le` bounds `‖deriv f c‖` at the *centre* of a
disc; halving the radius turns that pointwise bound into one that is uniform over a ball
(`norm_deriv_le_of_forall_mem_closedBall_two_mul_norm_le`), and the mean value inequality on that
ball then bounds `dist (f z) (f w)` by a multiple of `dist z w` with a constant depending only on
the sup bound (`dist_le_of_forall_mem_closedBall_two_mul_norm_le`).  That constant is uniform in
the family, which is exactly equicontinuity.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsLocallyBoundedOn F s`: the family `F` of maps out of a topological space is
  uniformly bounded on every compact subset of `s`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsLocallyBoundedOn.comp`: local boundedness passes to any reindexing of the family,
  in particular to a subsequence.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.norm_deriv_le_of_forall_mem_closedBall_norm_le` and
  `EpsilonEridani.norm_deriv_le_of_forall_mem_closedBall_two_mul_norm_le`: Cauchy's estimate from a sup
  bound on a closed ball, at the centre and then uniformly over the ball of half the radius.
* `EpsilonEridani.dist_le_of_forall_mem_closedBall_two_mul_norm_le` and
  `EpsilonEridani.lipschitzOnWith_of_forall_mem_closedBall_two_mul_norm_le`: a sup bound `M` on
  `closedBall c (2 * r)` makes a holomorphic function `M / r`-Lipschitz on `ball c r`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsLocallyBoundedOn.equicontinuousOn`: a locally bounded family of holomorphic
  functions is equicontinuous.  With `EpsilonEridani.IsLocallyBoundedOn.exists_forall_norm_le`, this
  supplies the local inputs for an Arzelà--Ascoli exhaustion argument.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsLocallyBoundedOn.deriv` and `EpsilonEridani.IsLocallyBoundedOn.equicontinuousOn_deriv`: the
  derivatives of a locally bounded family of holomorphic functions are again locally bounded, hence
  also equicontinuous.

This advances the L1 (normal families / Montel) layer of the conformal-mapping roadmap, which
fixes local boundedness as "bounded on each compact `K ⊆ Ω`".  The roadmap's scalar generality bar
governs the *conformal* statements it adds — Rouché, Hurwitz, the Riemann mapping theorem — whose
hypotheses genuinely use `ℂ` as the target; the Cauchy estimates below are the inputs those
statements consume, and are stated at the generality Mathlib already provides for them.  As with
the rest of the L0--L3 conformal-mapping material it is coordinated with the upstream Mathlib
Riemann-mapping effort leanprover-community/mathlib4#33505, which proves a Montel equicontinuity
statement internally as a private lemma; these declarations are a temporary shim, to be deleted
and refactored to Mathlib's API once that human-curated work lands.
