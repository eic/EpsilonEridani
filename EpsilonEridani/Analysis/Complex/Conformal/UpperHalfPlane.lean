# Conformal maps of the closed upper half-plane

This file transports a conformal map of the closed unit disc to the closed upper half-plane.
The Cayley transform followed by a rotation identifies the closed upper half-plane with the closed
disc minus a specified boundary point, so the transported map has that boundary value as its limit
at infinity.

## Main statements

* EpsilonEridani.bijOn_mul_left_of_norm_eq_one: multiplication by a unit complex number preserves the
  open unit disc and carries the closed unit disc with 1 removed to the disc with that number
  removed.
* EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousOn_bijOn_upperHalfPlaneSet_of_injOn_closedBall: transport of a
  continuous injective closed-disc map which is holomorphic on the open disc.

/-- A conformal map of the closed disc can be transported to the closed upper half-plane.
Let g be continuous and injective on the closed unit disc and holomorphic on the open disc, with
g applied to the open disc equal to Ω, and let p lie in the frontier of Ω. Then precomposing g
with a rotated Cayley transform gives a map which is continuous on the closed upper half-plane,
holomorphic on the open upper half-plane, and has the stated bijectivity and limit properties. -/
