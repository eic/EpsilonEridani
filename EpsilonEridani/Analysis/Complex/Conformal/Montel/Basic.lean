# Montel's selection theorem

A locally bounded family of holomorphic maps of an open set `Ω ⊆ ℂ` into a proper complex normed
space is a normal family: every sequence drawn from it has a subsequence converging locally
uniformly on `Ω`, and the limit is again holomorphic. This is the **Montel selection** component of
layer **L1 (normal families / Montel)** of the conformal-mapping roadmap, and the compactness
engine the Riemann mapping theorem runs on (there with the scalar target `E = ℂ`). The other
component L1 lists, Vitali's theorem, is proved in `Conformal/Vitali.lean`, which applies the
selection theorem below.

The compactness this runs on is `Conformal/Montel/Precompact.lean`: the restricted family is
relatively compact in `C(↥Ω, E)` with its compact-open topology, and there it is *equivalent* to
local boundedness. What is added here is the passage from that compactness to a convergent
subsequence, and the identification of the limit.

An open subset of `ℂ` is locally compact and second countable, hence σ-compact and so hemicompact —
a countable cofinal family of compacts — which is what makes the compact-open topology on
`C(↥Ω, E)` first countable (local compactness alone would not suffice), and
`IsCompact.tendsto_subseq` extracts a convergent subsequence. Finally
`ContinuousMap.tendsto_iff_tendstoLocallyUniformly` turns compact-open convergence into locally
uniform convergence, and `TendstoLocallyUniformlyOn.differentiableOn` gives holomorphy of the limit.

No compact exhaustion or diagonal argument is needed: Mathlib's Arzelà–Ascoli framework, invoked
in `Conformal/Montel/Precompact.lean`, subsumes both.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.montel` — a locally bounded family of holomorphic maps of an open set into a proper
  complex normed space has a locally uniformly convergent subsequence, with holomorphic limit.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Per the *Coordination with upstream Mathlib* section of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, L0–L3
material overlaps [mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505),
which proves a Montel equicontinuity statement internally as a private lemma. **This file is
therefore a temporary shim**: once the corresponding Mathlib results land, this statement should be
backed by them — or deleted and its consumers refactored — rather than maintained as an independent
re-proof. What Tau Ceti adds at L1 is named, discoverable API, not first proof.

Note this is the **analytic** normal-families theorem; it is deliberately not routed through
Mathlib's `Analysis/LocallyConvex/Montel.lean` (`MontelSpace`), which is an unrelated notion.

/-- **Montel's selection theorem.** A locally bounded family of holomorphic maps of an open set
`Ω ⊆ ℂ` into a proper complex normed space `E` is normal: every sequence from it has a subsequence
converging locally uniformly on `Ω`, and the limit is holomorphic.

The local boundedness hypothesis cannot be dropped once `E` is nontrivial: on any *nonempty* open
`Ω`, and for a unit vector `v : E`, the holomorphic family `F n z = n • v` has no locally uniformly
convergent subsequence. Both qualifications are needed for that counterexample: on `Ω = ∅` the
conclusion is vacuous, and on the trivial `E = 0` there is no unit vector and every family
converges, so local boundedness is genuinely dispensable in those two degenerate cases.
Properness of `E` cannot be dropped either — see
`EpsilonEridani.isCompact_closure_range_of_isLocallyBoundedOn`, where it enters; for a normed space over
`ℂ` it is exactly finite-dimensionality, and the scalar case `E = ℂ` is the one the Riemann
mapping theorem uses. -/
