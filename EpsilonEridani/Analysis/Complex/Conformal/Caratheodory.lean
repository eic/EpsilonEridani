# Carathéodory's continuity theorem

A conformal map of a disc onto a bounded region whose boundary is a Jordan curve extends
continuously to the closed disc.

## The argument

Fix a point `ζ` of the bounding circle and a tolerance `ε`. The **crosscut neighbourhoods**
`ball c r ∩ ball ζ ρ` shrink to `ζ`, so by the Cauchy criterion
`EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_of_forall_exists` it is enough to make the image of one of them
have diameter at most `ε`. Four inputs combine to do that, at a radius `ρ` chosen by the
length–area method:

* **a small curve along the crosscut.**
  `EpsilonEridani.exists_isJordanCurve_superset_closure_image_ball_inter_sphere_diam_le_of_isBounded`
  produces, at some radius `ρ` below any prescribed bound, a Jordan curve `J` of diameter at most
  `ε` containing the closed image crosscut and running back along the image boundary;
* **the far side stays wide.** `EpsilonEridani.exists_pos_forall_le_diam_image_sdiff_closedBall`, applied
  at the point `ζ` off the disc, gives a `d > 0` below which the image of the far side
  `ball c r \ closedBall ζ ρ` never shrinks, for every small `ρ`; taking `J` narrower than `d` makes
  it narrower than the far side;
* **both sides of the cut are connected.** The near side `ball c r ∩ ball ζ ρ` is an intersection of
  two discs, hence convex (`EpsilonEridani.isConnected_ball_inter_ball`); the far side
  `ball c r \ closedBall ζ ρ` is connected by the Möbius reduction
  `EpsilonEridani.isConnected_ball_diff_closedBall`;
* **a Jordan curve minus a point is preconnected.** At a point of the circular crosscut, the curve
  `J` minus that point is path-connected by
  `EpsilonEridani.IsJordanCurve.isPathConnected_sdiff_singleton`, so the winding-number two-sidedness
  theorem applies directly. No plane-separation hypothesis is needed.

`EpsilonEridani.image_inter_ball_subset_filledHull_of_diam_lt_of_isPreconnected_sdiff_singleton`
then puts the *near* side inside `filledHull J` — the far side cannot be the enclosed one, being
wider than `J` —
and `EpsilonEridani.diam_le_diam_of_subset_filledHull` reads that enclosure as the width bound
`diam (f '' (ball c r ∩ ball ζ ρ)) ≤ diam J ≤ ε`. Since this holds at every boundary point, the
extension theorem `EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousOn_closure_eqOn_of_isBounded` assembles the continuous
extension on `closedBall c r`.

## What is not claimed

**Injectivity of the extension is not established**, and no statement below asserts it: the L5
milestone asks for a homeomorphism of the closures, and this file supplies only the continuous
extension. Given injectivity on the bounding circle, `EpsilonEridani.closureHomeomorph` of
`Conformal/BoundaryCorrespondence.lean` upgrades the extension to that homeomorphism, and
`EpsilonEridani.injOn_closure_of_injOn_frontier` of `Conformal/ClusterSet.lean` reduces injectivity on the
closed disc to injectivity on the circle; producing the latter is a separate Jordan-curve argument
whose analytic half is `EpsilonEridani.not_eqOn_const_inter_sphere_of_injOn` of
`Conformal/ArcConstancy.lean`.

Nor is the *converse* route through `Conformal/Crosscut/BoundarySplit.lean` taken: the enclosure
route used here asks only that the near side fall inside a small curve, whereas that route asks
which arc of the image boundary the near side clings to.

## Roadmap role

This is layer **L5** of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`, the Jordan-domain case of the
Carathéodory boundary correspondence.

Layer L5 is absent from
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the in-progress
human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort, and Mathlib has no boundary correspondence for
conformal maps and no Jordan curve theorem, so this is new Lean formalization rather than a
temporary shim.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_diam_image_ball_inter_ball_le_of_isJordanCurve_frontier` — the crosscut
  neighbourhoods at a boundary point have images of arbitrarily small diameter.
* `EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_of_isJordanCurve_frontier` and
  `EpsilonEridani.exists_tendsto_nhdsWithin_of_isJordanCurve_frontier` — such a map has at most one
  boundary cluster value at each point of the bounding circle, hence a boundary limit there.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousOn_closedBall_eqOn_of_isJordanCurve_frontier` — **Carathéodory's
  continuity theorem**: it extends continuously to the closed disc.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousOn_closedBall_bijOn_ball_of_isJordanCurve_frontier` — the form the
  milestone is stated in: a bounded simply connected domain with Jordan-curve boundary is the
  image of the disc under a holomorphic bijection continuous up to the closed disc.

/-! ## The crosscut neighbourhoods have small images -/

/-- **The image of a crosscut neighbourhood can be made arbitrarily small.** Let `f` be holomorphic
and injective on `ball c r`, with bounded image whose boundary is a Jordan curve, and let `ζ` lie on
the bounding circle. For every `ε > 0` there is a crosscut radius `ρ > 0` with

> `Metric.diam (f '' (ball c r ∩ ball ζ ρ)) ≤ ε`.

The preconnectedness hypothesis on the curve `J` minus a point, needed by the enclosure theorem
`EpsilonEridani.image_inter_ball_subset_filledHull_of_diam_lt_of_isPreconnected_sdiff_singleton`, is
supplied by `EpsilonEridani.IsJordanCurve.isPathConnected_sdiff_singleton`. Connectedness of both cut
sides and a far
side wider than `J` are discharged here. -/

/-- **Such a map has a boundary limit at each point of the bounding circle.** The values of `f`
converge as the argument approaches `ζ` from inside the disc.

The cluster set at `ζ` is a subsingleton by
`EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_of_isJordanCurve_frontier`, and it is nonempty because `f` maps
the disc into the compact closure of its bounded image, which is what
`EpsilonEridani.exists_tendsto_of_clusterSetOn_subsingleton` needs; `Metric.closure_ball` puts `ζ` in the
closure of the disc. This is the pointwise form of
`EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousOn_closedBall_eqOn_of_isJordanCurve_frontier`, and names the limit. -/

/-- **Carathéodory's continuity theorem.** A holomorphic injection of a disc
onto a bounded region whose boundary is a Jordan curve extends continuously to the closed disc.

Every boundary cluster set is a subsingleton by
`EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_of_isJordanCurve_frontier`, which is exactly what the extension
theorem `EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousOn_closure_eqOn_of_isBounded` asks of a map into a proper space
with bounded image; `Metric.frontier_ball` and `Metric.closure_ball` turn its `frontier` and
`closure` into the circle and the closed disc.

No injectivity is claimed for the extension on the circle, and none is needed for continuity. -/

/-! ## The Jordan-domain form -/

/-- **A bounded Jordan domain is the image of the disc under a holomorphic bijection continuous up
to the closed disc.** This is the form layer **L5**
of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md` states its milestone in, minus the injectivity of the
boundary values.

The Riemann mapping theorem, in the shape
`EpsilonEridani.exists_bijOn_ball_differentiableOn_invFunOn`, supplies a holomorphic bijection of `Ω` onto
the disc with holomorphic inverse; the inverse is the map extended. That `Ω` is a proper subset of
`ℂ` needs no separate hypothesis, `frontier univ` being empty while a Jordan curve is not. Simple
connectivity is a hypothesis and not a consequence of the boundary being a Jordan curve: deducing it
is the Schoenflies theorem, which this development does not have.

The extension is named as the map itself rather than beside it: replacing the inverse Riemann map by
its extension changes neither its holomorphy on the open disc nor its bijectivity onto `Ω`. -/
