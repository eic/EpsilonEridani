# The piece a crosscut cuts off, measured by its boundary

`Topology/MetricSpace/Cut.lean` supplies the set-splitting lemmas that cut a set at a point `ζ` by
the circle `sphere ζ ρ`, leaving the *crosscut neighbourhood* `U ∩ ball ζ ρ` of `ζ`, and
`Conformal/Crosscut/Basic.lean` turns an oscillation bound on that neighbourhood into a boundary
limit for a *disc* `U`, by the maximum modulus principle. This file carries that criterion to an
arbitrary open `U`, and supplies the oscillation bound for a *conformal* map, in the geometric form
that layer **L5** of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md` — the Carathéodory boundary
correspondence — produces it: the image of the crosscut neighbourhood is no wider than the image of
the crosscut arc together with the piece of `∂Ω` that arc cuts off.

## The boundary of the image of a crosscut neighbourhood

Write `Ω = f '' U` for the image domain and `A = f '' (U ∩ ball ζ ρ)` for the image of the crosscut
neighbourhood, `f` being holomorphic and injective on the open set `U`. Then
(`EpsilonEridani.frontier_image_inter_ball_subset`)

> `frontier A ⊆ f '' (U ∩ sphere ζ ρ) ∪ frontier Ω`:

the boundary of `A` consists of the *image crosscut* and of boundary points of `Ω`, and nothing
else.

Nothing in that statement distinguishes the two sides of the crosscut, nor uses any complex
analysis, so it is proved once and elsewhere:
`EpsilonEridani.frontier_image_subset_image_union_frontier_image` in `EpsilonEridani/Topology/Frontier.lean`
splits an arbitrary set into two pieces `s`, `t` with disjoint open images and a remainder `u`,
over arbitrary topological spaces. All that is spent here is the open mapping theorem, which turns
the two open sides of the crosscut into open images, and `Disjoint.image`, which makes those images
disjoint from injectivity. Simple connectivity plays no role, and neither does the geometry of
`Ω` — nor even openness of `U`, which enters only when the splitting is produced.

Instantiating it at the near side and at the far side `U \ closedBall ζ ρ`, which by
`EpsilonEridani.sdiff_sphere_eq_inter_ball_union_sdiff_closedBall` are disjoint and open and leave exactly
the crosscut arc, gives `EpsilonEridani.frontier_image_inter_ball_subset` and
`EpsilonEridani.frontier_image_sdiff_closedBall_subset`: a consumer may bound either side.

## From the boundary to the piece

A bounded set in a normed space is no wider than anything bounded that contains its frontier
(`EpsilonEridani.diam_le_diam_of_frontier_subset`, in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Normed/Module/DiamFrontier.lean`), so the inclusion above is already a diameter
bound: for any `E` containing the boundary points of `Ω` that lie on `frontier A`,

> `diam A ≤ diam (f '' (U ∩ sphere ζ ρ) ∪ E)`

(`EpsilonEridani.diam_image_inter_ball_le`), and likewise for the far side
(`EpsilonEridani.diam_image_sdiff_closedBall_le`). Feeding those bounds, one for each tolerance, to the
Cauchy criterion `EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_of_forall_exists` of
`Topology/ClusterSet.lean` — a diameter bound on the image of an approach region bounding the
distance between two of its values by `Metric.dist_le_diam_of_mem` — gives the boundary limit
`EpsilonEridani.exists_tendsto_nhdsWithin_of_forall_exists_diam_union_le` and, if the bounds are available
at every point of `frontier U`, the continuous extension to `closure U`,
`EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousOn_closure_eqOn_of_forall_exists_diam_union_le`.

This is the **geometric** counterpart of the analytic criterion
`EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousOn_closedBall_eqOn` of `Conformal/Crosscut/Basic.lean`. That one asks for
a bound on the values of `f` along the crosscut arc *and along a collar* of the boundary circle, and
runs on the maximum modulus principle; this one replaces the collar bound by a hypothesis about
the *image*, namely that the boundary points of `Ω` clinging to the cut-off piece can be enclosed in
a small set `E`. That is the shape in which the two remaining L5 inputs arrive: the length–area
method makes the image crosscut short, and local connectedness of `∂Ω` supplies the small
connected `E`
joining its two ends. Neither is proved here; what is proved here is that those two data suffice,
with no maximum principle and no estimate on `f` inside the domain.

Nothing below assumes that `ζ` lies on `frontier U`, or that `Ω` is anything but bounded, so the
hypotheses stay checkable; only the final two theorems, which produce a limit, ask `ζ` to be
adherent to `U`.

## Generality

The domain `U` is an arbitrary open set rather than a disc. The disc is where the *inputs* live —
`Conformal/ShortCrosscut.lean` makes an image crosscut of a disc short — but nothing in the
argument below uses the shape of `U`, and the Carathéodory correspondence is a statement about
both a Jordan domain and the disc it is mapped from, so both directions of it are served only by
the general form. The cut itself is still a circle `sphere ζ ρ`, which is what makes the crosscut
neighbourhoods a neighbourhood basis of `ζ`.

In accordance with the generality bar of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, which fixes scalar `ℂ` for
every theorem added in layers L0–L6, everything below is stated for maps of `ℂ`. The three steps
that never mention a holomorphic map are stated at their own generality elsewhere, and consumed
here: `EpsilonEridani.frontier_image_subset_image_union_frontier_image` for maps between arbitrary
topological spaces, `EpsilonEridani.diam_le_diam_of_frontier_subset` — through `EpsilonEridani.diam_frontier`
and `IsPreconnected.inter_frontier_nonempty` — for an arbitrary real normed space, and
`EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_of_forall_exists` for a map between metric spaces. What
remains here is exactly the conformal content: the open mapping theorem, and the reading of a
circular cut as a crosscut.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.frontier_image_inter_ball_subset` and `EpsilonEridani.frontier_image_sdiff_closedBall_subset` —
  the boundary of the image of either side of a crosscut is covered by the image crosscut and the
  boundary of the image domain.
* `EpsilonEridani.diam_image_inter_ball_le` and `EpsilonEridani.diam_image_sdiff_closedBall_le` — either side of a
  crosscut has image no wider than the image crosscut together with the boundary piece it cuts off.
* `EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_of_forall_exists_diam_union_le` — small cut-off pieces make
  the boundary cluster set a subsingleton.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_tendsto_nhdsWithin_of_forall_exists_diam_union_le` and
  `EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousOn_closure_eqOn_of_forall_exists_diam_union_le` — the resulting
  boundary limit and continuous extension to the closure.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Layer L5 is absent from
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the in-progress
human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort, which stops at the mapping theorem itself, and Mathlib
has no boundary correspondence for conformal maps. So this file is new Lean formalization rather
than a temporary shim. It consumes the L0–L3 shim
`EpsilonEridani.isOpen_image_of_differentiableOn_of_injOn`, to be refactored onto Mathlib's open mapping
API once the upstream work lands.

/-! ## The boundary of the image of one side -/

/-- **The boundary of the image of a crosscut neighbourhood lies on the image crosscut and on the
boundary of the image domain.** For `f` holomorphic and injective on an open `U`, the frontier of
the image `f '' (U ∩ ball ζ ρ)` of the crosscut neighbourhood is covered by the image
`f '' (U ∩ sphere ζ ρ)` of the crosscut arc together with `frontier (f '' U)`.

This is `EpsilonEridani.frontier_image_subset_image_union_frontier_image` for the near side of the
crosscut, the two sides of which are disjoint and open and cover the domain apart from the crosscut
arc by `EpsilonEridani.eq_inter_ball_union_sdiff_closedBall_union_inter_sphere`. That lemma asks nothing of
`f` beyond openness and disjointness of the images of the two sides, so
`EpsilonEridani.isOpen_image_of_differentiableOn_of_injOn` is the only place the analytic hypotheses enter,
and `Disjoint.image` reads the disjointness off injectivity alone. -/

/-! ## The diameter of the cut-off piece -/

/-- **The image of a crosscut neighbourhood is no wider than the image crosscut together with the
boundary piece it cuts off.** If every boundary point of the image domain `f '' U` that lies on the
frontier of `f '' (U ∩ ball ζ ρ)` belongs to a bounded set `E`, then the diameter of that image is
at most the diameter of `f '' (U ∩ sphere ζ ρ) ∪ E`.

This is `EpsilonEridani.frontier_image_inter_ball_subset` read through
`EpsilonEridani.diam_le_diam_of_frontier_subset` — a bounded set is no wider than anything bounded
containing its frontier — the two boundary hypotheses combining into the single inclusion
`frontier (f '' (U ∩ ball ζ ρ)) ⊆ f '' (U ∩ sphere ζ ρ) ∪ E` that lemma consumes. No estimate on
`f` is used, the width of the piece being entirely determined by the width of what bounds it. -/

boundary piece it cuts off.** The mirror of `EpsilonEridani.diam_image_inter_ball_le`: whichever of the two
sides a boundary piece is supplied for, that side is the one bounded. -/

/-! ## The boundary limit -/

/-- **The crosscut criterion in geometric form, cluster-set version.** If for every `ε > 0` there
is a crosscut radius `ρ > 0` and a bounded set `E` enclosing the boundary points of the image domain
that cling to the cut-off piece, such that the image crosscut together with `E` has diameter at most
`ε`, then `f` has at most one cluster value at `ζ` along `U`.

This is `EpsilonEridani.diam_image_inter_ball_le` fed to the Cauchy criterion
`EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_of_forall_exists`: the crosscut neighbourhood is an approach
region, and `Metric.dist_le_diam_of_mem` reads the diameter bound on its image as a bound on the
distance between two values of `f` there, the image being bounded because `f '' U` is. -/

/-- **The crosscut criterion in geometric form, boundary-limit version.** A conformal map of a
domain with bounded image has a limit at a point `ζ` of its closure, along the domain, as soon as
the pieces it cuts off at `ζ` can be made small in the sense of
`EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_of_forall_exists_diam_union_le`.

The cluster set is a subsingleton by that theorem, and it is nonempty because `f` maps the domain
into the compact closure of its bounded image, which is what
`EpsilonEridani.exists_tendsto_of_clusterSetOn_subsingleton` needs. -/

    (fun w hw => subset_closure ⟨w, hw, rfl⟩) hζ
    (subsingleton_clusterSetOn_of_forall_exists_diam_union_le hUo hd hinj hb h)

/-- **The crosscut criterion in geometric form, continuous-extension version.** If the hypothesis of
`EpsilonEridani.exists_tendsto_nhdsWithin_of_forall_exists_diam_union_le` holds at *every* boundary point
of the domain, the conformal map `f` extends continuously to `closure U`.

This is the shape the Carathéodory boundary correspondence is proved in once the two geometric
inputs are available: the length–area method makes the image crosscut short at some radius, and
local connectedness of the image boundary supplies the small set `E` joining its ends. Nothing here
asserts that the extension is injective, which is an independent matter. For a disc,
`Metric.frontier_ball` and `Metric.closure_ball` turn the hypothesis and the conclusion into
statements about `sphere c r` and `closedBall c r`. -/
