# The open-mapping degree

The local mapping theorem: near a point `z₀` at which `f - f z₀` vanishes to order `n`, every
value `w` close enough to `f z₀` is attained exactly `n` times, counted with multiplicity. This is
the third target of layer **L0 (the local-mapping engine)** of the conformal-mapping roadmap.

This strengthens the open mapping theorem quantitatively. That theorem says the image of an open
set is open — every nearby value is attained *at least* once. The degree says how many times:
exactly `n`, so `f` is locally an `n`-to-one branched cover, behaving like `z ↦ z ^ n` up to a
change of coordinates. Nothing here is derived from Mathlib's
`Complex.AnalyticOnNhd.is_constant_or_isOpenMap`; the relationship is one of strength, not
dependency.

The proof is a Rouché comparison. On a circle small enough that `z₀` is the only solution of
`f z = f z₀` inside, `‖f - f z₀‖` attains a positive minimum `δ`; for `‖w - f z₀‖ < δ` the
difference `(f - f z₀) - (f - w) = w - f z₀` is smaller than `‖f - f z₀‖` there, so Rouché equates
the zero counts of `f - w` and `f - f z₀` inside. The latter count collapses to the single order at
`z₀`, because `z₀` is its only zero in the disc.

Adding the hypothesis that `f'` is zero-free on the punctured disc upgrades the count with
multiplicity to the sharper classical statement: for `w ≠ f z₀` the `n` solutions are *distinct*
and each is a *simple* zero of `f - w`.

That refinement yields the **local injectivity criterion**: an analytic function is injective on
some neighbourhood of `z₀` exactly when `deriv f z₀ ≠ 0`. The forward direction is proved here — a
critical point makes the degree at least `2`, so a nearby value is attained twice — and needs no
non-constancy hypothesis, since a function constant near `z₀` is not injective there either. The
converse is Mathlib's inverse function theorem
(`HasStrictDerivAt.eventually_left_inverse`), consumed rather than reproved.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.localDegree` — the count form, with the radius supplied by the caller.
* `EpsilonEridani.localDegree_card` — the distinct-and-simple form.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_localDegree` — the textbook form: if `z₀` is an isolated solution of `f z = f z₀`,
  suitable radii exist.
* `EpsilonEridani.not_injOn_of_deriv_eq_zero` — a critical point destroys injectivity on *every*
  neighbourhood of `z₀`.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_injOn_nhds_iff_deriv_ne_zero` — the local injectivity criterion.
* `EpsilonEridani.deriv_ne_zero_of_injOn` — the derivative of a holomorphic injection of
  an open set vanishes nowhere on it.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Per the *Coordination with upstream Mathlib* section of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, L0 material
overlaps [mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the
in-progress human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort. **This file is therefore a temporary
shim**: once corresponding Mathlib lemmas land, these statements should be backed by them — or
deleted and their consumers refactored — rather than maintained as independent re-proofs. What Tau
Ceti adds at L0 is named, discoverable API, not first proof.
