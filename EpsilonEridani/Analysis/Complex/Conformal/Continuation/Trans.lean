# Analytic continuation along a concatenation of paths

`Continuation/Basic.lean` carries a holomorphic germ along a single path and proves that the
result is determined by the initial germ. This file supplies the other half of the basic calculus
of analytic continuation: continuing along `γ` and then along `δ` is continuing along the
concatenated path `γ.trans δ`, and conversely a continuation along a concatenation restricts to
one along each factor.

## The gluing engine

Both directions run on general facts about `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong`, stated for an
arbitrary parameter space in `Continuation/Basic.lean` and consumed here:

* only the values of the path on the parameter set matter
  (`EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.congr_path`);
* one family of germs that continues over each of two **closed** parameter sets continues over
  their union (`EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.union`) — closedness being what makes the
  gluing true rather than a convenience, since the locality condition over a parameter set is
  vacuous outside its closure.

The restriction direction needs no gluing at all: reading `γ` as the first half of `γ.trans δ` is
a reparametrisation, and `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.reparam` already transports a
continuation along any reparametrisation.

## The concatenated family

The family of germs carried along `γ.trans δ` is written down explicitly, as
`EpsilonEridani.transFamily`: on the first half of the parameter interval it is the family carried along
`γ`, read at twice the parameter, and on the second half the one carried along `δ`. Assembling two
families indexed by the unit interval into one is pure reparametrisation, so `EpsilonEridani.transFamily`
carries values in an arbitrary sort and is specialised to germs only where continuations are
concatenated. The two halves are compared at the junction, where `EpsilonEridani.transFamily` takes the
value coming from `γ`; the hypothesis of `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.trans` is exactly
that the germ `γ` delivers there agrees with the germ `δ` starts from.

## Moving the base point

The pay-off is that continuability inside a domain does not depend on the base point:
`EpsilonEridani.continuesInside_of_isAnalyticContinuationAlong` says that if a germ continues inside `U`
from `z₀` — the hypothesis the monodromy theorem for a simply connected domain runs on
(`Conformal/GlobalBranch.lean`) — and is continued along a path inside `U` to a germ at `z₁`, then
that germ continues inside `U` from `z₁`. Concatenation supplies the paths issuing from `z₁`, and
restriction plus uniqueness of continuation along a fixed path identify the germ reached halfway.

Transport is in fact an equivalence, `EpsilonEridani.continuesInside_iff_of_isAnalyticContinuationAlong`:
the reversed path `p.symm` carries the germ back, the family read backwards being a continuation
along it by `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.reparam`. So no endpoint of the path is
distinguished — continuability inside `U` is a property of the domain and of the branch being
carried, and any point the branch reaches may serve as its base point.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.transFamily` — the family of germs carried along a concatenation.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.trans` — **continuations concatenate**: two continuations
  whose germs match at the junction assemble into a continuation along `γ.trans δ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.continuesAlong_trans` — the germ-level form: a germ that continues along `γ` to a germ
  that continues along `δ` continues along `γ.trans δ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.left_of_trans`, `.right_of_trans` — **continuations
  restrict**: a continuation along `γ.trans δ` reads as a continuation along `γ` and one
  along `δ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ContinuesAlong.left_of_trans` — the germ-level form of the first of those: a germ
  that continues along `γ.trans δ` continues along `γ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.continuesInside_of_isAnalyticContinuationAlong` — **continuability inside a domain
  travels with the germ**: continuing inside `U` along a path of `U` again continues inside `U`.
* `EpsilonEridani.continuesInside_iff_of_isAnalyticContinuationAlong` — the equivalence: the two germs at
  the ends of such a path continue inside `U` together, or neither does.

## Generality

Germs of maps `ℂ → E` into a complex Banach space, as in `Continuation/Basic.lean`, where the
choice is discussed; the conformal-mapping consumers instantiate `E = ℂ`. `EpsilonEridani.transFamily` is
pure reparametrisation and is stated for values in an arbitrary sort, and the two restriction
lemmas need no completeness, being reparametrisations as well.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

This is basic API for layer **L4** of the conformal-mapping roadmap
(`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`), analytic continuation and the reflection
principle. Mathlib has no analytic continuation along a path, and L4 is absent from
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the in-progress
human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort, which stops at the mapping theorem itself. So
nothing here is a shim under the roadmap's shim-deletion clause, which covers L0–L3 only. The
`Path.trans` concatenation and its `Path.extend` calculus are consumed from Mathlib rather than
rebuilt.

/-- The family carried along a concatenation `γ.trans δ` of paths, assembled from the family `F`
carried along `γ` and the family `G` carried along `δ`: on the first half of the parameter interval
it is `F`, read at twice the parameter, and on the second half it is `G`, read at twice the
parameter minus one. The junction time `1 / 2` is assigned the value coming from `F`, matching the
convention of `Path.trans`.

Assembling the two halves is pure reparametrisation of the unit interval, so the values are
allowed to lie in an arbitrary sort; the case of interest is `Y = ℂ → E`, where `F` and `G` are
families of germs (`EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.trans`). -/

So `EpsilonEridani.ContinuesInside`, the hypothesis of the monodromy theorem for a simply connected
domain, is a condition on the domain and on the branch being carried, not on the point one starts
from: a path issuing from `z₁` is continued by prefixing `p` to it, and uniqueness of continuation
along `p` identifies the germ reached halfway with `F 1`. -/

/-- **Continuability inside a fixed domain is invariant under base-point transport along an
analytic continuation inside that domain.** If `F` continues a germ along a path `p` of `U` from
`z₀` to `z₁`, then the germ `F 1` delivered at `z₁` continues inside `U` exactly when the germ
`F 0` it started from does.

This strengthens `EpsilonEridani.continuesInside_of_isAnalyticContinuationAlong`, its `←` direction, to
an equivalence, and drops the representative `f₀` from the statement; the version with a
representative is recovered from `EpsilonEridani.continuesInside_congr`. The `→` direction transports the
base point back along the reversed path `p.symm`, along which the family read backwards, `F ∘ σ`,
is again a continuation: reversing the parameter is a reparametrisation of the parameter interval
by the central symmetry `σ`, which `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.reparam` transports. So
neither endpoint of `p` is distinguished, and any point the branch reaches inside `U` may serve as
the base point of `EpsilonEridani.ContinuesInside`, the hypothesis of the monodromy theorem for a simply
connected domain (`Conformal/GlobalBranch.lean`). -/
