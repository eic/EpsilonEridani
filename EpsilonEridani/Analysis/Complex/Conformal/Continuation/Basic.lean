# Analytic continuation along a path

An **analytic continuation along a path** `γ` is the classical device that turns a single
holomorphic germ into a multi-valued function: one carries the germ along `γ`, re-expanding it at
each parameter time. This file introduces that notion and proves its fundamental property, that a
continuation is **determined by its initial germ**.

A continuation is recorded as a family `f : X → ℂ → E` of functions indexed by the path parameter,
subject to the requirement that `f t` be analytic at `γ t` and that the germ of `f u` at `γ u`
agree with the germ of `f t` at `γ u` for all `u` near `t`. Equivalently — and this is the way to
read the definition — the assignment `t ↦ (germ of f t at γ t)` is a *continuous lift* of `γ` to
the étale space of holomorphic germs — literally so, by
`EpsilonEridani.isAnalyticContinuationAlong_iff_continuousOn_germPoint` of
`Conformal/Continuation/Etale.lean`. The classical "chain of overlapping discs" definition is the
same condition written with explicit discs; the germ formulation avoids carrying the discs around.

The parameter space `X` is an arbitrary topological space, and the parameter set `s : Set X` is
constrained only by `IsPreconnected` where the mathematics needs it. Nothing here uses the order or
the field structure of the reals, so the usual `X = ℝ` with `s = Set.Icc 0 1` and Mathlib's
`Path`, whose parameter space is `unitInterval`, are both directly available.

## Generality

The germs carried are germs of maps `ℂ → E` into a complex normed space `E`. The generality is
free rather than speculative: every analytic fact this file consumes is one Mathlib already states
for maps into an arbitrary normed space, so the scalar case is not one line shorter. The
uniqueness theorem rests on Mathlib's identity principle
`AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq` and on the openness of the analyticity locus
`AnalyticAt.exists_ball_analyticOnNhd`; `DifferentiableOn.analyticOnNhd` produces continuations
from holomorphy; and the closure lemmas below consume `AnalyticAt.deriv`, `.add` and `.neg`, and
`AnalyticAt.mul` and `.pow` for the two that multiply germs. In the words of the generality bar of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`, these are *inputs consumed from Mathlib at whatever
generality Mathlib provides*; the conformal-mapping theorems that consume this file — the
reflection and boundary layers — are scalar and stay scalar, instantiating `E = ℂ`.

Completeness of `E` is asked for exactly where those Mathlib inputs ask for it, and nowhere else:
the definition itself, the gluing and reparametrisation lemmas, and the closure of continuations
under sums and products need none, while everything resting on the identity principle —
`EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.eventuallyEq` and all of its consequences — needs `E` to be a
Banach space.

The *domain* stays `ℂ`. That is where the roadmap's scalar bar bites: a path in a higher-dimensional
domain is not the object the monodromy theorem and its consumers are about, and `deriv` — under
which continuations are closed below — is one-dimensional. The two closure lemmas that multiply
germs, `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.mul` and `.pow`, ask for a complex normed algebra `A`
in place of `E`, again the generality at which Mathlib states `AnalyticAt.mul`.

## The uniqueness theorem

`EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.eventuallyEq`: two continuations along the same path over a
preconnected parameter set whose germs agree at one parameter time agree at every parameter time.

The proof is the standard connectedness argument. Germ agreement is a *locally constant* property
of the parameter: at a time `t`, both `f t` and `g t` are analytic on a common disc `D` about
`γ t`, so by the identity principle (`AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq`) their
germs agree at one point of `D` exactly when they agree at every point of `D` — and for `u` near
`t` the point `γ u` lies in `D` while the germs of `f u, g u` at `γ u` are those of `f t, g t`.
A locally constant property on a preconnected parameter set is constant
(`IsLocallyConstant.apply_eq_of_preconnectedSpace`).

## Continuability as a property of the initial germ

A continuation is determined by its initial germ, so *being continuable* is a property of that
germ alone. `EpsilonEridani.ContinuesAlong` records it for a single path of the unit interval, and
`EpsilonEridani.ContinuesInside` for every path inside a domain issuing from a base point; both transport
across eventual equality of the initial function (`EpsilonEridani.continuesAlong_congr`,
`EpsilonEridani.continuesInside_congr`). `EpsilonEridani.ContinuesInside` is the hypothesis of the monodromy
theorem for a simply connected domain (`Conformal/GlobalBranch.lean`).

Both predicates are closed under the additive and the ring operations and under differentiation,
because a continuation of a combination of germs is the corresponding combination of continuations
of the parts: the closure lemmas of `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong` transport to them
verbatim, with no choice of continuation to reconcile. A function analytic at every point of a
continuous path continues along it via the constant family
(`EpsilonEridani.ContinuesAlong.of_analyticAt`), so
continuability is a condition one may check on the pieces of a germ built from simpler ones.
They are also closed under concatenating paths, which `Continuation/Trans.lean` proves.

## Relation to the monodromy theorem

This is the L4 prerequisite that the monodromy theorem of the conformal-mapping roadmap needs:
uniqueness of the continuation along a *fixed* path. The monodromy theorem itself compares
continuations along *homotopic* paths, and in the étale-space picture is an instance of Mathlib's
abstract `IsLocalHomeomorph.monodromy_theorem` (`Mathlib/Topology/Homotopy/Lifting.lean`), whose
docstring describes exactly this application; the uniqueness proved here is the concrete form of
the separatedness hypothesis that abstract theorem consumes. That étale space is built in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/HolomorphicSheaf.lean`, and `Conformal/Continuation/Etale.lean` supplies
the continuation/lift correspondence needed to apply the abstract theorem to it.

## Main definitions and results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong` — `f` is an analytic continuation along `γ` over the
  parameter set `s`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.const`, `.of_differentiableOn` — a holomorphic function
  continues itself along any path in its domain.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.congr`, `.congr_path` — only the carried germs matter, and
  only the values of the path on the parameter set.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.union` — continuations glue over two **closed** parameter
  sets.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.deriv`, `.add`, `.mul`, `.neg`, `.sub`, `.pow` —
  continuations are closed under the germ-wise operations.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.reparam` — a continuation transports along any
  reparametrisation of the path by a continuous map into its parameter set, of which restriction
  to a smaller parameter set (`EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.mono`) is the identity case.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.eventuallyEq` — **uniqueness**: a continuation over a
  preconnected parameter set is determined by its germ at a single time.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.eventuallyEq_of_mapsTo` — continuing a holomorphic function
  along a path that stays inside its domain gives that function back.
* `EpsilonEridani.ContinuesAlong`, `EpsilonEridani.ContinuesInside` — continuability of a germ along one path,
  and along every path inside a domain. Neither body is exposed; downstream files use them through
  `EpsilonEridani.continuesAlong_iff_exists`, `EpsilonEridani.ContinuesInside.continuesAlong` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ContinuesInside.of_forall`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ContinuesAlong.add`, `.mul`, `.neg`, `.sub`, `.pow`, `.deriv` and their
  `EpsilonEridani.ContinuesInside` counterparts — continuability of a germ is inherited by sums, products,
  differences, powers and derivatives.

/-- Two functions analytic on a ball whose germs agree at one point of the ball have equal germs
at every point of the ball. This is the identity principle in germ form: the ball is preconnected,
so agreement near one of its points propagates to all of it, and the ball is open, so agreement on
it is agreement near each of its points. -/

/-! ### Analytic continuation along a path -/

/-- `IsAnalyticContinuationAlong f γ s` says that the family `f` is an **analytic continuation
along the path `γ`** over the parameter set `s`: for each parameter time `t ∈ s` the function `f t`
is analytic at the point `γ t`, and the germ carried at time `t` is locally constant in `t`, in the
sense that `f u` and `f t` have the same germ at `γ u` for every `u ∈ s` close enough to `t`.

Only the germ of `f t` at `γ t` matters; the values of `f t` away from `γ t` are unconstrained.
Reading the germs as points of the étale space of holomorphic germs over `ℂ`, the condition says
precisely that `t ↦ (germ of f t at γ t)` is a continuous lift of `γ`; that is
`EpsilonEridani.isAnalyticContinuationAlong_iff_continuousOn_germPoint`. -/

/-- **A continuation transports along a reparametrisation of the path.** Precomposing both the
family and the path with a map `φ` of parameters that is continuous on `s'` and sends `s'` into `s`
again gives a continuation, over `s'` and along the reparametrised path `γ ∘ φ`.

Nothing further is asked of `φ` — it need not be injective, monotone, or cover `s` — so this
covers restriction (`EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong.mono`, the case `φ = id`), reversal of a
path, and the passage between the parameter conventions `X = ℝ` with `s = Icc 0 1` and
`X = unitInterval` with `s = univ` that this file's two layers use. Only this direction is claimed:
if `φ '' s'` fails to cover `s` then part of the original path is dropped, so continuing along
`γ ∘ φ` does not in general continue along `γ`. The germ carried at a reparametrised time is by
construction the germ carried at the original time, so no uniqueness argument is needed: the
conclusion is about the *same* family, read along `φ`. -/

/-- **Continuations glue over closed parameter sets.** One family of germs that is a continuation
along `γ` over each of two closed parameter sets is a continuation over their union.

Closedness is essential rather than cosmetic. At a parameter time outside the closure of `s` the
locality condition over `s` is vacuous, so it says nothing about how the germ carried there
relates to the germs carried on `s`; taking both sets closed makes every parameter time of the
union cling only to the piece it already lies in. -/

/-- The germ of `f₀` at `z₀` **continues inside `U`**: it continues along every path that starts
at `z₀` and stays in `U`.

This is the hypothesis of the monodromy theorem. It is a condition on the germ
(`EpsilonEridani.continuesInside_congr`) and on the domain jointly: the germ of `Complex.log` at `1`
continues inside `ℂ \ {0}`, and continues inside the slit plane, but is single-valued only on the
latter. -/

/-! #### Closure under the germ-wise operations

Continuability inside `U` is continuability along each path of `U` at once, so it inherits the
closure properties of `EpsilonEridani.ContinuesAlong` path by path. Read through the monodromy theorem for
a simply connected domain (`Conformal/GlobalBranch.lean`), these are the statements that a germ
assembled from germs extending to `U` extends to `U` itself. -/
