# Analytic continuation as a lift to the étalé space of holomorphic germs

`Conformal/Continuation/Basic.lean` defines `EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong` — a family `f`
of functions carrying, at each parameter time `t`, a germ at `γ t`, locally represented by a
single holomorphic function — and its docstring records, without proof, that

> reading the germs as points of the étale space of holomorphic germs over `ℂ`, the condition says
> precisely that `t ↦ (germ of f t at γ t)` is a continuous lift of `γ`.

`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/HolomorphicSheaf.lean` builds that space. This file proves the sentence
(`EpsilonEridani.isAnalyticContinuationAlong_iff_continuousOn_germPoint`). The étalé projection is a
separated local homeomorphism, which is exactly what Mathlib's abstract monodromy theorem
`IsLocalHomeomorph.monodromy_theorem` asks of a map, so that theorem applies verbatim to
holomorphic germs.

## The dictionary

Given that each `f t` is analytic at `γ t`, the two remaining clauses of a continuation — that the
path is continuous and that nearby parameter times carry the same germ — and continuity of
`t ↦ germPoint (f t) (γ t)` say the same thing, and the proof is a translation in both directions
of the same fact about the étalé topology, namely that the germs of one section over one open set
form a neighbourhood of each of them:

* forwards, `f t =ᶠ[𝓝 (γ t)] f t₀` for `t` near `t₀` says the germ map agrees near `t₀` with
  `germPoint (f t₀) ∘ γ`, and the germ map of a *single* holomorphic function is continuous
  (`EpsilonEridani.HolomorphicPresheaf.continuousOn_germPoint`), being the section of the étalé space
  that function sweeps out;
* backwards, continuity puts the lifted point, for `t` near `t₀`, in the set of germs of one
  section representing `f t₀`, and reading that membership back through
  `EpsilonEridani.HolomorphicPresheaf.germAt_eq_iff` — the identity of two germs is the eventual identity
  of two analytic functions — is the locality clause.

The base point of the lift is `γ t` by construction (`EpsilonEridani.HolomorphicPresheaf.base_germPoint`),
so no separate lifting condition has to be stated, and continuity of `γ` itself need not be
assumed: it is continuity of the lift composed with the continuous étalé projection. In the other
direction a continuous map into the étalé space is a continuation of its own representatives
(`EpsilonEridani.isAnalyticContinuationAlong_repFun`), so the two notions are interchangeable rather than
merely comparable.

## Monodromy, and what this does not replace

`Conformal/Monodromy.lean` proves the monodromy theorem for germ families directly, by a metric
stability argument. Mathlib's abstract theorem now applies directly to the separated local
homeomorphism built here: it is stated about continuous lifts of the rows of a homotopy rel
endpoints, not about germ families. It does
not replace `EpsilonEridani.monodromy_theorem_of_free_homotopy`, whose homotopy is allowed to move the
endpoints and whose conclusion is a continuation along the path the far endpoint sweeps out;
Mathlib's abstract theorem is rel endpoints and gives an equality of points, so the free-homotopy
form remains the business of the metric engine in `Conformal/Monodromy.lean`. What is gained here
is the interface: monodromy for holomorphic germs is now an instance of covering-space-style path
lifting, in the vocabulary the deck-group and uniformization consumers of layer **L4** of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md` speak.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isAnalyticContinuationAlong_iff_continuousOn_germPoint` — **a continuation along a path
  is exactly a continuous lift of that path to the étalé space of holomorphic germs**.
* `EpsilonEridani.isAnalyticContinuationAlong_repFun` — the converse reading: a continuous map into the
  étalé space continues the germs it carries along its own base path.

## Generality

The germs are germs of maps `ℂ → E` into a complex Banach space `E`, the generality of both
`EpsilonEridani.IsAnalyticContinuationAlong` and the sheaf built in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/HolomorphicSheaf.lean`. The two restrictions on `E` are the ones that
file records: `Type` rather than `Type*`, for a universe reason of Mathlib's étalé space, and
completeness, which `AnalyticAt.exists_ball_analyticOnNhd` asks for. The parameter space `X` and
the parameter set `s` are arbitrary, as in
`Conformal/Continuation/Basic.lean`: nothing below needs the parameter set to be an interval.

/-! ### A continuation along a path is a continuous lift -/

/-- **Analytic continuation along a path is a continuous lift to the étalé space of holomorphic
germs.** Assume each `f t` is analytic at `γ t`. Then `f` is an analytic continuation along `γ`
exactly when the germ it carries, read as a point of the étalé space of holomorphic germs, depends
continuously on the parameter.

Neither remaining clause of a continuation has to be assumed. The lifting condition is automatic,
the germ point of `f t` at `γ t` sitting over `γ t` by construction, and continuity of `γ` is
continuity of the lift composed with the étalé projection. So the content of the equivalence is
that the locality clause of a continuation — nearby parameter times carry the same germ — is
continuity in the étalé topology. -/

/-- **A continuous map into the étalé space continues its own representatives.** Choosing at each
parameter time a holomorphic representative of the germ carried there gives an analytic
continuation along the base path of the lift.

Together with `EpsilonEridani.isAnalyticContinuationAlong_iff_continuousOn_germPoint` this says that
continuations along a path and continuous lifts of it are the same data, up to the choice of a
representative for a germ. -/
