# The Poincaré metric is the length metric of its density

`Hyperbolic/Distance.lean` defines the hyperbolic distance on the complex open unit disc by the
closed formula `hyperbolicDist z w = Real.artanh (pseudoHyperbolicExpr z w)`, and
`Hyperbolic/Density.lean` shows that its infinitesimal density is `(1 - ‖z‖ ^ 2)⁻¹` and that the
distance from the origin along a *radius* is the integral of that density along the radius. The
latter file records, in so many words, what was still missing: "the density-weighted length of a
general curve is not defined here, so this does not identify `hyperbolicDist` with the length
metric of the density between arbitrary points". This file supplies the definition and the
identification.

The definition is the obvious one: for a path `γ : ℝ → ℂ` in the disc,

`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength γ a b = ∫ t in uIcc a b, ‖deriv γ t‖ / (1 - ‖γ t‖ ^ 2)`,

the Euclidean speed integrated against the Poincaré density over the *unordered* parameter
interval, as for Mathlib's `Manifold.pathELength`: the length of a path does not depend on the
orientation of its parameter interval, and is nonnegative. That is the length of `γ` measured
against the density `(1 - ‖z‖ ^ 2)⁻¹` in the sense of `EpsilonEridani.densityLength` of
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Calculus/DensityLength.lean`, and `hyperbolicLength` is *defined* as that
instance: everything about the *parameter* side of the integral — that the length is unoriented
and additive, that it depends on the path only through its restriction to the parameter interval,
that it is unchanged by an affine, monotone or antitone reparametrisation, and that comparing the
density-weighted speeds of two paths compares their lengths — is proved there, for an arbitrary
density on an arbitrary real normed space, and is only read off here. What this file adds is what
the Poincaré density itself contributes. The two post-composition statements below — the Moebius
invariance `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_unitDiscMoebiusFormula_comp` and the Schwarz--Pick estimate
`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_comp_le` — reduce to a *pointwise* identity, respectively estimate,
between density-weighted speeds, which is where the Poincaré density enters, the passage from
there to the integrals being the general congruence and comparison; the lower bound below and the
path attaining it are one-variable calculus arguments of their own, described next.

The theorem is that `hyperbolicDist z w` is the **least** such length over `C¹` paths from `z` to
`w` (`EpsilonEridani.isLeast_hyperbolicLength`): no path is shorter
(`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicDist_le_hyperbolicLength`), and one path realises the value
(`EpsilonEridani.exists_hyperbolicLength_eq_hyperbolicDist`). Regularity is always asked of the path
*relative to its parameter interval*: continuity on the closed interval, an ordinary derivative
at its interior points, and a derivative that extends continuously to the closed interval.

## The proof

Both halves rest on one algebraic fact, which `Conformal/SchwarzPick/AutomorphismIsometry.lean`
already supplies as the equality case of the infinitesimal Schwarz--Pick lemma
(`EpsilonEridani.norm_deriv_div_one_sub_norm_sq_unitDiscMoebiusFormula_of_norm_lt_one`): the disc
Moebius factor `M z = (z - c) / (1 - conj c * z)` preserves the Poincaré density,

`‖M ′ z‖ / (1 - ‖M z‖ ^ 2) = 1 / (1 - ‖z‖ ^ 2)`.

Integrating it along a path gives `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_unitDiscMoebiusFormula_comp`:
hyperbolic length is unchanged by post-composition with a disc Moebius factor. That is what moves
an arbitrary path to one starting at the origin.

*The lower bound.* For a path with `γ a = 0` the estimate is a one-variable calculus argument.
Choosing a unit vector `v` with `v * γ b = ‖γ b‖` — one exists for every `γ b`, including
`γ b = 0`, by Mathlib's `Complex.exists_norm_eq_mul_self` — the real function `ψ t = (v * γ t).re`
runs from `0` to `‖γ b‖` and satisfies `|ψ| ≤ ‖γ‖` and `|ψ ′| ≤ ‖γ ′‖`. Hence, pointwise,

`(Real.artanh ∘ ψ) ′ = ψ ′ / (1 - ψ ^ 2) ≤ ‖γ ′‖ / (1 - ‖γ‖ ^ 2)`,

the first inequality being `1 - ‖γ‖ ^ 2 ≤ 1 - ψ ^ 2` in the denominator. That is precisely the
hypothesis of the displacement bound `EpsilonEridani.norm_sub_le_densityLength` — a function of the
parameter whose speed is dominated by the density-weighted speed of `γ` moves by at most the
length of `γ` — read at the Poincaré density and at `Real.artanh ∘ ψ`, whose displacement is
`Real.artanh ‖γ b‖ = hyperbolicDist (γ a) (γ b)`. Projecting on a *linear* functional rather than
on the norm is what keeps the comparison function differentiable where the path crosses the
origin.

*The bound is attained.* By the same invariance it suffices to exhibit a shortest path from the
origin, and the Euclidean radius `t ↦ u * t` is one: its hyperbolic length over `[0, r]` is
`∫ t in (0)..r, (1 - t ^ 2)⁻¹ = Real.artanh r` (`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_ray`), which is
`Real.integral_one_sub_sq_inv_eq_artanh`, the same input the radial statement of
`Hyperbolic/Density.lean` spends. Transporting the radius by the Moebius factor centred at `-z`
joins `z` to `w` with length `hyperbolicDist z w`. The minimisers exhibited here are therefore
the radii through the origin and their Moebius images, the hyperbolic geodesics classified in
`Conformal/Poincare/Betweenness.lean`; the converse — that a path of least length is a
reparametrisation of one of them — is an equality case that this file does not prove.

## Schwarz--Pick: hyperbolic length is contracted, and conformally invariant

The Moebius invariance above is the equality case of a one-sided estimate, and the estimate holds
for *every* holomorphic self-map of the disc, not only for the automorphisms. Integrating the
infinitesimal Schwarz--Pick inequality
`EpsilonEridani.norm_deriv_div_one_sub_norm_sq_le` of `Conformal/SchwarzPick/Derivative.lean` along a
path, exactly as the Moebius statement integrates its equality case, gives
`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_comp_le`: post-composing a path with a holomorphic self-map of the disc
does not increase its hyperbolic length. The comparison is termwise, because the chain rule turns
the density-weighted speed of `f ∘ γ` into

`‖deriv f (γ t)‖ / (1 - ‖f (γ t)‖ ^ 2) * ‖γ' t‖`,

the first factor of which Schwarz--Pick bounds by `(1 - ‖γ t‖ ^ 2)⁻¹`; both integrands are
continuous, since the derivative of a holomorphic function is again holomorphic, so
`EpsilonEridani.densityLength_le_densityLength` integrates the estimate. The Moebius invariance is the
same reading of the same general lemma's equality counterpart
`EpsilonEridani.densityLength_congr_of_eqOn`, which asks for no integrability, and that is why it holds
for a path with no regularity beyond a derivative inside its parameter interval.

Applying the estimate to a biholomorphism and to its inverse in turn pins the two lengths together
and makes hyperbolic length a **conformal invariant** of the disc
(`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_comp_eq_of_leftInvOn`): no explicit automorphism formula enters, only
the existence of a holomorphic inverse. Read at the standard automorphism
`z ↦ u * (z - c) / (1 - conj c * z)` it recovers
`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_unitDiscMoebiusFormula_comp` with its rotation factor restored, the
rotation costing nothing because multiplying a path by a unit scalar changes neither its Euclidean
speed nor its distance from the origin (`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_const_mul`). Reflection in the
real axis is invariant too (`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_conj`), which the conformal statement cannot
see, conjugation being antiholomorphic; with it the invariance covers the whole isometry group of
the Poincaré disc as `Conformal/Poincare/Isometry/Classification.lean` exhibits it.

## Relation to Mathlib's `Manifold.pathELength`

Why `EpsilonEridani.densityLength`, and not Mathlib's `ℝ≥0∞`-valued `Manifold.pathELength` of
`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/Riemannian/PathELength.lean`, is the notion being instantiated is
argued in `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Calculus/DensityLength.lean`. Should the Poincaré disc later be given
a Riemannian structure, `EpsilonEridani.isLeast_hyperbolicLength` is precisely the input needed to
identify `hyperbolicDist` with `Manifold.riemannianEDist`, and this file should be refactored onto
that API at that point.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength` — the density-weighted length of a path in the disc, with
  `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_eq_integral` rewriting it against an explicit derivative, and
  `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_symm`, `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_nonneg`,
  `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_const`, `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_add` the basic evaluations and
  operations.
* `EpsilonEridani.intervalIntegrable_norm_div_one_sub_norm_sq` and
  `EpsilonEridani.intervalIntegrable_norm_deriv_div_one_sub_norm_sq` — for a `C¹` path in the disc the
  density-weighted speed is interval integrable, against an explicit derivative and against
  `deriv` respectively. The latter is the integrability hypothesis of
  `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_add`, and what the Schwarz--Pick estimate and the lower bound below
  spend.
* `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_comp_of_deriv_nonneg` and
  `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_comp_of_deriv_nonpos` — **hyperbolic length is a reparametrisation
  invariant**: precomposing a path with a differentiable monotone, respectively antitone, map of
  the parameter transports the parameter interval and leaves the length unchanged. For the affine
  reparametrisations `t ↦ s * t + d` this needs nothing of the path,
  `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_comp_mul_add`.
* `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_congr` — the hyperbolic length of a path depends only on its values
  along its own parameter interval.

  These last three groups are the Poincaré readings of the density-independent statements
  `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_symm`, `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_nonneg`, `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_const`,
  `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_add`, `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_comp_of_deriv_nonneg`,
  `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_comp_of_deriv_nonpos`, `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_comp_mul_add` and
  `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_congr`, and are proved by naming them.
* `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_unitDiscMoebiusFormula_comp` — hyperbolic length is a Moebius
  invariant, the integrated form of the infinitesimal isometry
  `EpsilonEridani.norm_deriv_div_one_sub_norm_sq_unitDiscMoebiusFormula_of_norm_lt_one`;
  `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_const_mul` is the same statement for a rotation, and
  `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_conj` for the reflection in the real axis.
* `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_comp_le` — **Schwarz--Pick for the Poincaré length**: post-composing
  a path in the disc with a holomorphic self-map of the disc does not increase its hyperbolic
  length.
* `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_comp_eq_of_leftInvOn` — **hyperbolic length is a conformal
  invariant**: a holomorphic self-map of the disc with a holomorphic left inverse preserves it.
* `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_ray` — the hyperbolic length of a Euclidean radius is `Real.artanh`
  of its Euclidean length.
* `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicDist_le_hyperbolicLength` — **no `C¹` path in the disc is hyperbolically
  shorter than the hyperbolic distance between its endpoints.**
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_hyperbolicLength_eq_hyperbolicDist` — the bound is attained.
* `EpsilonEridani.isLeast_hyperbolicLength` — **the Poincaré metric is the length metric of its
  density**: `hyperbolicDist z w` is the least hyperbolic length of a `C¹` path from `z` to `w`.

## Mathlib's upper-half-plane metric

Mathlib has the hyperbolic metric on the upper half-plane
(`Analysis/Complex/UpperHalfPlane/Metric.lean`) but neither a disc version nor a length-metric
characterisation of it.

/-! ## The hyperbolic length of a path -/

/-- The **hyperbolic length** of the path `γ` over the parameter interval with endpoints `a` and
`b`: its length measured against the Poincaré density `(1 - ‖z‖ ^ 2)⁻¹` of
`Conformal/Hyperbolic/Density.lean`, in the sense of `EpsilonEridani.densityLength`. Unfolded, it is the
Euclidean speed `‖deriv γ t‖` integrated over the unordered interval `uIcc a b` against that
density (`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_def`).

Taking the integral over the unordered interval, as Mathlib's `Manifold.pathELength` does, makes
the length independent of the orientation of the parameter interval
(`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_symm`) and nonnegative for a path in the disc whichever way round its
endpoints are (`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_nonneg`); it is a reparametrisation invariant of the path
(`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_comp_of_deriv_nonneg` and `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_comp_of_deriv_nonpos`
for the monotone and the antitone reparametrisations, `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_comp_mul_add` for
the affine ones).

The definition is stated for an arbitrary `γ : ℝ → ℂ`, and only the derivative at the interior
parameters enters (`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_eq_integral`). It is the intended notion of length
when `γ` is a `C¹` path with values in the open unit disc, which is what the comparison with
`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicDist` below assumes; the evaluations of the length itself need no such
hypothesis. -/

/-! ## Conformal invariance of the density -/

/-- **Hyperbolic length is a rotation invariant.** Multiplying a path by a scalar of modulus one
scales neither its Euclidean speed nor its distance from the origin, so it changes no term of the
density-weighted integrand. Unlike the Moebius invariance below, this asks nothing of the path:
where the path fails to be differentiable so does its rotation, and both sides read the same
junk value of `deriv`. -/

/-- **Hyperbolic length is a conjugation invariant.** Reflecting a path in the real axis leaves its
hyperbolic length unchanged. As for the rotation invariance this asks nothing of the path:
conjugation is a real-linear isometry, so it changes neither term of the density-weighted
integrand, and at a parameter where the path fails to be differentiable both sides read the same
junk value of `deriv` (`deriv.star`). Conjugation is antiholomorphic, so this is not an instance of
the conformal invariance `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_comp_eq_of_leftInvOn` below; together the two
cover the whole isometry group of the Poincaré disc, which
`Conformal/Poincare/Isometry/Classification.lean` exhibits as the standard automorphisms and their
conjugates. -/

/-- **Hyperbolic length is a Moebius invariant.** Post-composing a path in the disc with the
Moebius factor `z ↦ (z - c) / (1 - conj c * z)` leaves its hyperbolic length unchanged: this is
the infinitesimal Poincaré isometry
`EpsilonEridani.norm_deriv_div_one_sub_norm_sq_unitDiscMoebiusFormula_of_norm_lt_one` integrated along
the path. It is the tool that moves the starting point of a path to the origin.

Only the density-weighted speeds of the two paths are compared, and they agree at every interior
parameter, so this is `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_congr_of_eqOn` and needs no integrability: the path
is asked for nothing beyond a derivative inside its parameter interval, and to stay in the disc
there, the two endpoints forming a null set — unlike the Schwarz--Pick estimate
`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicLength_comp_le` below, whose two integrands are only comparable. -/

/-- **The Poincaré metric is the length metric of the Poincaré density.** For two points of the
open unit disc, `hyperbolicDist z w` is the least hyperbolic length of a path in the disc running
from `z` to `w` that is continuous on its parameter interval and continuously differentiable
inside it.

Together with the classification of the hyperbolic geodesics in
`Conformal/Poincare/Betweenness.lean` this closes the circle of descriptions of the Poincaré
metric: the closed formula of `Hyperbolic/Distance.lean`, the infinitesimal density of
`Hyperbolic/Density.lean`, and the induced length metric all agree. -/
