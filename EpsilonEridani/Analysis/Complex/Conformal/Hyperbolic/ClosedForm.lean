# Closed forms for the hyperbolic distance on the unit disc

The hyperbolic (Poincaré) distance of `Conformal/Hyperbolic/Distance.lean` is defined as
`hyperbolicDist z w = Real.artanh (pseudoHyperbolicExpr z w)`, a reparametrisation of the
pseudo-hyperbolic expression `p = ‖(z - w) / (1 - conj w * z)‖`. That definition is the one that
makes the Schwarz--Pick contraction property and the triangle inequality easy, but it hides the
quantity behind an inverse hyperbolic tangent. This file evaluates the elementary functions of
`hyperbolicDist` in closed form, in terms of the three Euclidean quantities

* the numerator `‖z - w‖`,
* the Moebius denominator `‖1 - conj w * z‖`, and
* the product of hyperbolic defects `(1 - ‖z‖ ^ 2) * (1 - ‖w‖ ^ 2)`.

Everything rests on the **Poincaré defect identity**
`‖1 - conj w * z‖ ^ 2 - ‖z - w‖ ^ 2 = (1 - ‖z‖ ^ 2) * (1 - ‖w‖ ^ 2)`
(`EpsilonEridani.norm_sq_one_sub_conj_mul_sub_norm_sq_sub`), which says exactly that
`1 - p ^ 2 = (1 - ‖z‖ ^ 2) (1 - ‖w‖ ^ 2) / ‖1 - conj w * z‖ ^ 2`. Feeding that into Mathlib's
`Real.sinh_artanh`, `Real.cosh_artanh` and `Real.artanh_eq_half_log` turns the Moebius
denominator into the common factor that the quotient `p` and the defect `1 - p ^ 2` share, and it
cancels: what is left involves only `‖z - w‖`, `‖1 - conj w * z‖` and the defect product.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.one_sub_pseudoHyperbolicExpr_sq` and
  `EpsilonEridani.sqrt_one_sub_pseudoHyperbolicExpr_sq` — the defect identity in the form the closed
  forms consume;
* `EpsilonEridani.sinh_hyperbolicDist`, `EpsilonEridani.cosh_hyperbolicDist`, `EpsilonEridani.tanh_hyperbolicDist`,
  `EpsilonEridani.exp_hyperbolicDist` — the four elementary functions of the hyperbolic distance;
* `EpsilonEridani.cosh_two_mul_hyperbolicDist` — the double-angle form
  `cosh (2 d) = 1 + 2 ‖z - w‖ ^ 2 / ((1 - ‖z‖ ^ 2)(1 - ‖w‖ ^ 2))`, the identity usually quoted as
  *the* formula for the Poincaré distance;
* `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicDist_eq_half_log` and `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicDist_zero_right_eq_half_log` — the
  logarithmic form, in general and against the origin;
* `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicDist_le_iff_le_sinh` and `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicDist_le_div_sqrt` — the
  comparison with the Euclidean distance that the closed forms make available;
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_mem_ball_lt_hyperbolicDist` — the disc has infinite hyperbolic diameter.

## Normalisation

`hyperbolicDist` is normalised to the infinitesimal metric `|dz| / (1 - |z| ^ 2)`, half the
curvature `-1` metric `2 |dz| / (1 - |z| ^ 2)`; this is the normalisation already fixed by
`Conformal/Hyperbolic/Distance.lean` and used throughout `Conformal/Poincare/`. Under the Cayley
transform it corresponds to *half* the distance that Mathlib's `UpperHalfPlane.dist` records on
the upper half-plane, so the statements below are the disc analogues of Mathlib's
`UpperHalfPlane.sinh_half_dist`, `UpperHalfPlane.cosh_half_dist`, `UpperHalfPlane.tanh_half_dist`,
`UpperHalfPlane.exp_half_dist` and `UpperHalfPlane.cosh_dist` — the half-distance formulas there
are the plain ones here. The Cayley transform itself is not used: the disc formulas are proved
directly from the defect identity, which is shorter than transporting the half-plane ones and
avoids the `im`-versus-defect bookkeeping.

This advances the conformal-mapping roadmap's L2 target "the hyperbolic / Poincaré metric on `𝔻`"
(see `ConformalMapping/README.md`), completing the basic API of `hyperbolicDist` with the closed
forms that the geometric statements of `Conformal/Poincare/` are usually quoted in. As with the
rest of the L0--L3 conformal-mapping material it is coordinated with the upstream Mathlib RMT
effort leanprover-community/mathlib4#33505, which contains no Poincaré metric on the disc: should
a human-curated disc metric land in Mathlib, these formulas are to be refactored onto it.
