# The infinitesimal density of the Poincaré metric

`Hyperbolic/Distance.lean` defines the hyperbolic (Poincaré) distance on the complex open unit
disc in closed form, `hyperbolicDist z w = Real.artanh (pseudoHyperbolicExpr z w)`, and its
docstring asserts that this normalisation "agrees with the infinitesimal Poincaré metric
`|dz| / (1 - |z| ^ 2)`". Nothing in the disc files proved that assertion: the closed form and
the conformal density were never connected. This file connects them, in the two ways the
statement is normally read.

*Differentially.* Along any approach to a point `z` of the disc, the ratio of hyperbolic to
Euclidean distance tends to `(1 - ‖z‖ ^ 2)⁻¹`
(`EpsilonEridani.tendsto_hyperbolicDist_div_norm_sub`). The proof factors the ratio as

`hyperbolicDist z w / ‖w - z‖ = (artanh p / p) * ‖1 - conj w * z‖⁻¹`

for `p = pseudoHyperbolicExpr z w`, which is legitimate off the diagonal because `p` is
exactly `‖w - z‖ / ‖1 - conj w * z‖`. As
`w → z` the first factor tends to `1` — this is `Real.tendsto_artanh_div_nhdsNE_zero`,
the derivative of `Real.artanh` at the origin read as a limit of slopes — while the Moebius
denominator tends to `1 - ‖z‖ ^ 2`, which is where the density comes from.

*Integrally.* The hyperbolic distance from the origin along a radius is the integral of the
density over that radius, `∫ t in (0)..r, (1 - t ^ 2)⁻¹ = hyperbolicDist 0 (r * u)` for a unit
vector `u` (`EpsilonEridani.integral_one_sub_sq_inv_eq_hyperbolicDist_zero`): the hyperbolic distance
to a point is the length, in the density, of the radius joining it to the origin — and
`Poincare/Geodesic.lean` shows those radii to be the geodesics through the origin. Only radii
are treated here. Neither the density-weighted length of a general curve nor the infimum of
such lengths between two arbitrary points is defined anywhere in the tree, so nothing below
identifies `hyperbolicDist` as the length metric induced by the density; that identification
would need those definitions first.

Bounding the density between its values at the endpoints of a radius also gives the two-sided
comparison of the hyperbolic distance with the pseudo-hyperbolic expression,
`p ≤ hyperbolicDist ≤ p / (1 - p ^ 2)`; the lower bound sharpens the crude Euclidean estimate
`‖z - w‖ ≤ 2 * p` of `Poincare/Topology.lean` into `‖z - w‖ / ‖1 - conj w * z‖ ≤ hyperbolicDist`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.pseudoHyperbolicExpr_le_hyperbolicDist` and
  `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicDist_le_pseudoHyperbolicExpr_div_one_sub_sq` — the two-sided comparison of the
  hyperbolic distance with the pseudo-hyperbolic expression.
* `EpsilonEridani.tendsto_hyperbolicDist_div_norm_sub` — the infinitesimal Poincaré density
  `(1 - ‖z‖ ^ 2)⁻¹` at a point `z` of the disc.
* `EpsilonEridani.tendsto_hyperbolicDist_zero_div_norm` — the density at the origin is `1`, so the
  hyperbolic and Euclidean metrics are infinitesimally equal there.
* `EpsilonEridani.integral_one_sub_sq_inv_eq_hyperbolicDist_zero` — the radial form of the density.

This carries the conformal-mapping roadmap's L2 target "the hyperbolic / Poincaré metric on
`𝔻`" (see `ConformalMapping/README.md`) onto its infinitesimal side, and reuses Tau Ceti's
pseudo-hyperbolic and hyperbolic-distance API throughout. As with the rest of the L0--L3
conformal-mapping material, it is coordinated with the upstream Mathlib Riemann mapping effort
leanprover-community/mathlib4#33505 and should be refactored to upstream API if that work lands
a human-curated Poincaré metric; Mathlib's preceding human-curated work in
`Analysis/Complex/RiemannMapping.lean` and `Analysis/Complex/BranchLogRoot.lean` is neither
duplicated nor extended here. Mathlib has the hyperbolic metric on the upper half-plane
(`Analysis/Complex/UpperHalfPlane/Metric.lean`), but records no density statement for it
either.

/-! ### Comparison with the pseudo-hyperbolic expression -/

/-- The hyperbolic distance dominates the pseudo-hyperbolic expression: `Real.artanh` moves
`[0, 1)` upwards because the Poincaré density is at least `1`.

All that is needed is that the pseudo-hyperbolic expression lies below `1`; for two points of
the open unit disc that is `EpsilonEridani.pseudoHyperbolicExpr_lt_one_of_norm_lt_one`. -/

/-- The hyperbolic distance is bounded above by `p / (1 - p ^ 2)`, where `p` is the
pseudo-hyperbolic expression: the Poincaré density on `[0, p]` is at most its value at `p`.

As for the lower bound, only `p < 1` is needed, which holds for two points of the open unit
disc by `EpsilonEridani.pseudoHyperbolicExpr_lt_one_of_norm_lt_one`. -/

/-- **The infinitesimal Poincaré density.** At a point `z` of the open unit disc the ratio of
the hyperbolic distance to the Euclidean distance tends to `(1 - ‖z‖ ^ 2)⁻¹`.

This is the precise sense in which `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicDist` has infinitesimal density
`|dz| / (1 - |z| ^ 2)`: the closed form `Real.artanh` of the pseudo-hyperbolic expression is
only a reparametrisation, and the density it produces at `z` is read off from the Moebius
denominator `1 - conj z * z`. It is a statement about the first order behaviour at `z` alone;
calling `hyperbolicDist` the distance *induced* by that density would need the density-weighted
length of a curve, which is defined nowhere in the tree (see the module docstring). -/

/-! ### The radial form of the density -/

/-- **The hyperbolic distance along a radius is the integral of the density.** For a unit
vector `u` and a radius `r` in `[0, 1)`, the hyperbolic distance from the origin to `r * u` is
`∫ t in (0)..r, (1 - t ^ 2)⁻¹`.

This is the radial case of the agreement between `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicDist` and the density
`|dz| / (1 - |z| ^ 2)`, and only that case: the radii through the origin are geodesics of the
Poincaré disc (`EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc.isometry_radialGeodesic`), but the density-weighted length
of a general curve is not defined here, so this does not identify `hyperbolicDist` with the
length metric of the density between arbitrary points. -/
