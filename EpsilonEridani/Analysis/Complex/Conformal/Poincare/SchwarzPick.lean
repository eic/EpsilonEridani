# Schwarz–Pick for the metric space `PoincareDisc`

Layer **L2** of the conformal-mapping roadmap (`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`) asks
for two things at once: the Schwarz–Pick theorem, and the hyperbolic (Poincaré) metric on the
disc. Both are on `main`, but they meet only at the level of the scalar function
`EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicDist`: `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicDist_map_le` says a holomorphic self-map of
`Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1` does not increase `hyperbolicDist`, while the metric space carrying that
distance is the type synonym `EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc` of `Conformal/Poincare/MetricSpace.lean`. This
file states Schwarz–Pick *for that metric space*, so that the theorem becomes a statement in the
vocabulary of `Metric` — `LipschitzWith 1` and `Isometry` — that a metric-geometry consumer can use
without unfolding the distance.

The shape is the one `Conformal/Poincare/Isometry/Classification.lean` already uses for the
isometries: a self-map `F : PoincareDisc → PoincareDisc` is related to a scalar map `f : ℂ → ℂ` by
the hypothesis `(toUnitDisc (F z) : ℂ) = f (toUnitDisc z : ℂ)`, so that the analytic hypothesis
`DifferentiableOn` is stated where holomorphy lives, on `ℂ`, and the conclusions are stated where
the metric lives, on `PoincareDisc`. No new definition is introduced: `F` is whatever map the
consumer already has, and the representation hypothesis is what a consumer holding a holomorphic
self-map of the disc can always supply. That hypothesis already forces `f` to carry the unit disc
into itself — the value `f (toUnitDisc z : ℂ)` is a coordinate of `PoincareDisc` — so none of the
theorems below asks for a separate `MapsTo` hypothesis.

## What the metric form adds

Two statements are genuinely new here rather than transcriptions.

The first is the sharpening of the isometry classification. On `PoincareDisc` the isometries are
`Aut(𝔻)` *together with its orientation-reversing coset* (the theorem
`isometry_iff_exists_eq_unitDiscStandardAutomorphismIsometryEquiv_or_comp_star` of
`Conformal/Poincare/Isometry/Classification.lean`), conjugation being a hyperbolic isometry that is
not holomorphic. Restricted to the maps that *are* holomorphic, that coset disappears:
`EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc.isometry_iff_exists_eq_unitDiscStandardAutomorphismIsometryEquiv` says a
holomorphic self-map of the Poincaré disc is an isometry exactly when it is one of the standard
disc automorphisms. So `Aut(𝔻)` is not merely a subgroup of the isometry group; it is the whole of
its holomorphic part.

The second is the dichotomy `EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc.forall_dist_lt_or_isometry`: a holomorphic
self-map either strictly decreases the Poincaré distance between *every* pair of distinct points,
or preserves it between every pair. There is no intermediate behaviour — a single pair at which
the Schwarz–Pick inequality is an equality already forces the map to be a disc automorphism, which
is the rigidity
`EpsilonEridani.exists_forall_unitDisc_eq_unitDiscStandardAutomorphismEquiv_of_hyperbolicDist_map_eq`
read in the metric.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc.dist_map_le` and `EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc.lipschitzWith_one` —
  **Schwarz–Pick, metric form**: a holomorphic self-map of the disc is nonexpanding for the
  Poincaré metric.
* `EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc.exists_eq_unitDiscStandardAutomorphismIsometryEquiv_of_dist_eq` —
  **rigidity, metric form**: preserving the Poincaré distance between one pair of distinct points
  makes the map a standard disc automorphism.
* `EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc.isometry_of_dist_eq` — and hence an isometry.
* `EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc.isometry_iff_exists_eq_unitDiscStandardAutomorphismIsometryEquiv` — **the
  holomorphic isometries of the Poincaré disc are exactly `Aut(𝔻)`**.
* `EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc.forall_dist_lt_or_isometry` — strict contraction everywhere, or isometry.

## Generality

In accordance with the generality bar of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, which fixes the scalar
target `ℂ` for every theorem added in layers L0–L6, the scalar map `f` is a map of `ℂ`. The domain
is the unit disc rather than a general disc because `PoincareDisc` is the unit disc; the
hyperbolic metric of a domain biholomorphic to it is a separate transport question and is not
touched here.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Mathlib has no Poincaré metric on the disc — its hyperbolic material lives on `UpperHalfPlane` —
so it has no metric form of Schwarz–Pick either, and this file is new Lean formalization rather
than a temporary shim. Its scalar inputs are the L2 material of `Conformal/Hyperbolic/Distance.lean`
and `Conformal/SchwarzPick/Rigidity.lean`, which are coordinated with the in-progress
human-curated Riemann-mapping effort
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505); should a
human-curated Poincaré metric land upstream, this file is to be refactored onto it.

/-- The representation hypothesis shared by the theorems below is satisfiable, so none of them is
vacuous, and this is how a consumer holding only a scalar map discharges it: a map `f` of `ℂ`
carrying the unit disc into itself is represented by the self-map of `PoincareDisc` that reads a
point as a complex number, applies `f`, and reads the result back. Holomorphy of `f` plays no part
in producing the representative; it is only the estimates that need it. -/

/-- A map of `ℂ` representing a self-map of `PoincareDisc` carries the unit disc into itself: each

Together with

/-- **The equality case of Schwarz–Pick, bundled.** A holomorphic self-map of the unit disc that
preserves the Poincaré distance between one pair of distinct points *is* a standard disc
automorphism, as a map of `EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc`.

This is the bundled reading of
`EpsilonEridani.exists_forall_unitDisc_eq_unitDiscStandardAutomorphismEquiv_of_hyperbolicDist_map_eq`,
whose conclusion is an identity of scalar functions on `Complex.UnitDisc`; here it is an identity
of self-maps of the metric space, against the isometric equivalences
`EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc.unitDiscStandardAutomorphismIsometryEquiv`. -/

This is the unbundled reading of
`EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc.exists_eq_unitDiscStandardAutomorphismIsometryEquiv_of_dist_eq`, the disc
automorphism it produces being an isometric equivalence. -/

/-- **The holomorphic isometries of the Poincaré disc are exactly the disc automorphisms.** A
holomorphic self-map of the unit disc is a Poincaré isometry if and only if it is one of the
standard automorphisms `z ↦ u * (z - a) / (1 - conj a * z)`.

This sharpens the theorem
`isometry_iff_exists_eq_unitDiscStandardAutomorphismIsometryEquiv_or_comp_star` of
`Conformal/Poincare/Isometry/Classification.lean`,
which classifies *all* Poincaré isometries and has to admit the orientation-reversing coset of
`Aut(𝔻)`: the conjugation `EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc.starIsometryEquiv` is an isometry, so that
alternative cannot be dropped there. It disappears here because holomorphy excludes it. Hence the
disc automorphisms are precisely the holomorphic part of the isometry group. -/

/-- **A holomorphic self-map of the Poincaré disc is a strict contraction or an isometry.** For a
holomorphic self-map of the unit disc, either the Poincaré distance between *every* pair of
distinct points strictly decreases, or it is preserved between every pair — in which case the map
is one of the disc automorphisms, by
`EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc.isometry_iff_exists_eq_unitDiscStandardAutomorphismIsometryEquiv`. Nothing
in between occurs: one pair at which Schwarz–Pick is an equality decides the whole map.

The two alternatives cannot both hold, since `PoincareDisc` has distinct points and an isometry
preserves the distance between them; the statement is left a plain disjunction because that is the
form a consumer case-splits on. -/
