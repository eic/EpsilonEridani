# The Poincaré disc carries the Euclidean topology and is a proper metric space

`Poincare/MetricSpace.lean` equips the type synonym `EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc` of
`Complex.UnitDisc` with the hyperbolic (Poincaré) distance `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicDist` as a
`MetricSpace` instance. That instance says nothing yet about how the resulting topology
compares with the Euclidean subspace topology of the disc, nor whether the metric is complete.
This file settles both.

The comparison rests on two elementary estimates for the pseudo-hyperbolic expression
`p = pseudoHyperbolicExpr z w = ‖(z - w) / (1 - conj w * z)‖`, of which the hyperbolic distance
is the reparametrisation `Real.artanh p`:

* the Moebius denominator has norm at most `2` on the disc, so `‖z - w‖ ≤ 2 * p`, which makes
  the identity map from the Poincaré disc to the Euclidean disc Lipschitz-like near the
  diagonal;
* `p` depends continuously on `(z, w)` — that is `EpsilonEridani.continuousOn_pseudoHyperbolicExpr`,
  from `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/PseudoHyperbolic.lean` — and `Real.artanh` is
  continuous on `(-1, 1)` — that is
  `Real.continuousOn_artanh`, from `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Artanh.lean` — so the
  hyperbolic distance is jointly continuous for the Euclidean topology.

Properness comes from a compact exhaustion: a closed hyperbolic ball around `x` of radius `r`
is contained in the closed Euclidean disc of radius `Real.tanh (r + hyperbolicDist x 0)`, whose
radius is strictly less than one, so it is a closed subset of a compact subset of the open disc.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.continuousOn_hyperbolicDist` — the hyperbolic distance is jointly continuous on
  `ball 0 1 ×ˢ ball 0 1`.
* `EpsilonEridani.norm_sub_le_two_mul_pseudoHyperbolicExpr` — the Euclidean distance of two disc
  points is at most twice their pseudo-hyperbolic expression.
* `EpsilonEridani.hyperbolicDist_zero_le_iff_norm_le_tanh` — the closed hyperbolic ball about the
  origin of radius `r` is the closed Euclidean ball of radius `Real.tanh r`.
* `EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc.toUnitDiscHomeomorph` — the identification of the Poincaré disc with
  `Complex.UnitDisc` is a homeomorphism; the `simp` lemmas `toUnitDiscHomeomorph_apply` and
  `toUnitDiscHomeomorph_symm_apply` characterise both directions, so consumers never need to
  unfold the definition, whose body is deliberately not exposed.
* `EpsilonEridani.PoincareDisc.instProperSpace` — the Poincaré disc is a proper metric space, hence
  complete and locally compact.

This carries the conformal-mapping roadmap's L2 target "the hyperbolic / Poincaré metric on
`𝔻`" (see `ConformalMapping/README.md`) onto its topological side: with the homeomorphism in
hand, the hyperbolic metric may be used interchangeably with the Euclidean one for topological
purposes, and completeness is what makes the Poincaré disc a usable model of the hyperbolic
plane. It reuses Tau Ceti's pseudo-hyperbolic and hyperbolic-distance API. As with the rest of
the L0--L3 conformal-mapping material, it is coordinated with the upstream Mathlib Riemann
mapping effort leanprover-community/mathlib4#33505 and should be refactored to upstream API if
that work lands a human-curated Poincaré metric. Mathlib already contains the preceding
human-curated work in `Analysis/Complex/RiemannMapping.lean` and
`Analysis/Complex/BranchLogRoot.lean`; this file duplicates none of their branch-logarithm and
root API, adding only the topological side of the hyperbolic metric. Mathlib has the hyperbolic
metric on the upper half-plane (`Analysis/Complex/UpperHalfPlane`), but no Poincaré metric on
the disc.

/-! ### Properness of the Poincaré metric -/

/-- **The Poincaré disc is a proper metric space.** A closed hyperbolic ball of radius `r` about
`x` consists of points at hyperbolic distance at most `r + hyperbolicDist x 0` from the origin,
hence of Euclidean norm at most `Real.tanh (r + hyperbolicDist x 0) < 1`; it is therefore a
closed subset of a compact subset of the open disc.

Concretely, every bounded hyperbolic ball is contained in a Euclidean subdisc of radius strictly
less than one. Together with the instances Mathlib derives from `ProperSpace`, this makes the
Poincaré disc a complete and locally compact metric space. -/

Mathlib derives `CompleteSpace` and `LocallyCompactSpace` from `ProperSpace`; we record that
those instances are indeed found for the Poincaré disc. -/
