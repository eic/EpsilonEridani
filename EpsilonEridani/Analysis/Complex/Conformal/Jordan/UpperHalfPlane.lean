# The Riemann map of a Jordan domain on the closed upper half-plane

Carathéodory's theorem extends the Riemann map of a Jordan domain to a homeomorphism from the
closed unit disc onto the closure of the domain. This file applies the generic closed-disc to
upper-half-plane transport to that map.

## Main statement

* EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousOn_bijOn_upperHalfPlaneSet_of_isJordanCurve_frontier: the Riemann map
  of a Jordan domain, normalized to send infinity to a prescribed boundary point, as a continuous
  injection of the closed upper half-plane.

/-- Carathéodory's theorem on the closed upper half-plane. Let Ω be a bounded, simply connected
open subset of ℂ whose frontier is a Jordan curve, and let p be a point of that frontier. Then
there is a map which is continuous on the closed upper half-plane, holomorphic on the open upper
half-plane, a bijection from the open upper half-plane onto Ω, from the closed upper half-plane
onto closure Ω with p removed and from the real line onto frontier Ω with p removed, and which
tends to p at infinity within the closed half-plane. -/
