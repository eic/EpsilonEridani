# Morera's theorem

This file provides the named scalar form of Morera's theorem required by the L0 target
"Morera as a named theorem" in `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`. Mathlib already
proves the more general equivalence between conservativity and complex differentiability, so
the result here is a direct specialization rather than a parallel API.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.morera`: a continuous function on an open set whose rectangle integrals vanish is
  holomorphic.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

The conformal-mapping roadmap's L0-L3 layers overlap the in-progress Riemann mapping work in
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505). If Mathlib adds a
dedicated `morera` declaration, this named specialization should be refactored onto it.
