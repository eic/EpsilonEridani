# The circular crosscut of a disc at a boundary point

Fix a disc `ball c r` and a point `ζ` of its boundary circle. For `0 < ρ < 2 * r` the circle
`sphere ζ ρ` meets the disc in an arc, the **circular crosscut** of `ball c r` at `ζ` of radius
`ρ`, and that arc cuts the disc in two: the *crosscut neighbourhood* `ball c r ∩ ball ζ ρ` of `ζ`,
and the rest, `ball c r \ closedBall ζ ρ`. This file proves that decomposition, and then uses the
crosscut neighbourhoods as the approach regions along which the boundary behaviour of a holomorphic
function is read off.

Both halves are needed for layer **L5** of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`, the
Carathéodory boundary correspondence: the crosscut neighbourhoods are the regions the length–area
method estimates on, and the criterion below is what converts such an estimate into the continuous
extension the L5 milestone asks for.

## The decomposition

That `ball c r ∩ ball ζ ρ` is connected is immediate — it is an intersection of two balls, hence
convex — and is proved in a seminormed real vector space, together with the rest of what the
crosscut neighbourhood is, in `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Normed/Module/Ball/Cut.lean`. The other piece is
not convex,
and the proof is the **Möbius reduction** the roadmap
prescribes for circles: the inversion `z ↦ (z - ζ)⁻¹` at the boundary point `ζ` carries the disc to
a half-plane, because a circle through the centre of an inversion goes to a line. Concretely,
writing `a = c - ζ`, a point `z ≠ ζ` lies in `ball c r` exactly when `1 < 2 * (a * (z - ζ)⁻¹).re`
(`EpsilonEridani.mem_ball_iff_one_lt_two_mul_re_mul_inv`): the disc becomes the open half-plane
`{w | 1 < 2 * (a * w).re}`. The inversion simultaneously turns the *complement* of `closedBall ζ ρ`
into the ball `ball 0 ρ⁻¹`, since `‖(z - ζ)⁻¹‖ = ‖z - ζ‖⁻¹`. So `ball c r \ closedBall ζ ρ` is
carried onto an intersection of a half-plane with a ball — convex, and nonempty exactly when
`ρ < 2 * r` — and is therefore connected, being the image of a connected set under the continuous
inverse inversion `w ↦ ζ + w⁻¹`.

The two pieces are open, disjoint and cover `ball c r \ sphere ζ ρ`, so they *are* its connected
components: a circular crosscut separates the disc into exactly two parts, and a connected subset
of the disc missing the crosscut lies entirely in one of them. That the crosscut neighbourhood is
one of the two components is
`EpsilonEridani.connectedComponentIn_ball_diff_sphere_eq_ball_inter_ball` of
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Normed/Module/Ball/Cut.lean`, which needs no complex structure; that the other
piece is the other component is
`EpsilonEridani.connectedComponentIn_ball_diff_sphere_eq_ball_diff_closedBall` below, resting on the
Möbius reduction.

## The angular description

Which *angles* the crosscut occupies is settled in `EpsilonEridani/Topology/Circle/Metric.lean`, where
nothing ties the cutting circle to the disc: writing `α = arg (c - ζ)` for the direction from `ζ`
to the centre and `d = dist ζ c`, the law of cosines `EpsilonEridani.dist_circleMap_sq` puts the point of
`sphere ζ ρ` at angle `θ` at distance `ρ ^ 2 + d ^ 2 - 2 * ρ * d * cos (θ - α)`, squared, from `c`,
so it lies in the disc exactly when `ρ ^ 2 + d ^ 2 - r ^ 2 < 2 * ρ * d * cos (θ - α)`
(`EpsilonEridani.circleMap_mem_ball_iff_sq`, with `EpsilonEridani.circleMap_mem_closedBall_iff_sq` beside it),
and that condition holds throughout an interval of angles inside a period centred at `α` as soon
as it holds at both ends (`EpsilonEridani.circleMap_mem_ball_of_mem_Icc`).

What this file adds is the *boundary-point* reading of that criterion, where `d = r`: the two
squared radii cancel and the condition becomes `ρ < 2 * r * cos (θ - α)`
(`EpsilonEridani.circleMap_mem_ball_iff`, with the `simp`-normal form `EpsilonEridani.dist_circleMap_lt_iff`
beside it), so for `0 < ρ < 2 * r` the crosscut consists of the angles *strictly* within
`arccos (ρ / (2 * r))` of `α`, while for `2 * r ≤ ρ` no angle satisfies the condition and
`sphere ζ ρ` misses the disc altogether. Rather than name that half-width, the arc statement is
left in its general form: the crosscut is an arc.

## The boundary criterion

The frontier of the crosscut neighbourhood is contained in the union of two pieces of circle
(`EpsilonEridani.frontier_ball_inter_ball_subset` of `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Normed/Module/Ball/Cut.lean`, which
asks nothing of the ambient space beyond a pseudo-metric): the arc `closedBall c r ∩ sphere ζ ρ`,
and the cap
`sphere c r ∩ closedBall ζ ρ` cut off on the boundary of the disc. Equality can fail — for
`2 * r ≤ ρ` the crosscut neighbourhood is the whole disc, and its frontier misses the arc — but
containment is all a frontier bound needs. Since the crosscut neighbourhood
is bounded and open, the maximum modulus principle bounds `f` inside it by its values on those two
pieces (`EpsilonEridani.norm_sub_le_of_mem_ball_inter_ball`).

That frontier form is not what a boundary criterion can be built on, because reading `f` on the cap
presupposes that `f` is continuous up to the boundary — and continuity up to the boundary *is* the
conclusion one is after, at `ζ` and everywhere else. So the estimate is re-run on the concentric
subdiscs `ball c s` with `s < r`, on whose closures a function holomorphic on `ball c r` is
automatically continuous, and their crosscut neighbourhoods exhaust `ball c r ∩ ball ζ ρ`. This
gives `EpsilonEridani.norm_sub_le_of_mem_ball_inter_ball_of_differentiableOn`: only holomorphy on the open
disc is assumed, the arc bound is asked for on `ball c r ∩ sphere ζ ρ`, and the cap bound is
replaced by a bound on a *collar* `r₀ ≤ dist w c` of the boundary inside the crosscut
neighbourhood — all of it data about `f` inside the disc. Feeding those oscillation bounds, one for
each tolerance `ε`, to `EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_of_forall_exists`, one gets:

> a bounded holomorphic function on a disc has a limit at a boundary point `ζ` as soon as, for
> every `ε > 0`, there is *some* radius `ρ > 0` at which `f` is within `ε` of a single value on
> the part `ball c r ∩ sphere ζ ρ` of the circle around `ζ` inside the disc and on a collar of
> the boundary.

The radius is quantified per `ε`, and need not tend to zero: it is `ε` that shrinks, while `ρ`
(along with the collar and the value approximated) is merely allowed to depend on it. Nor is `ρ`
asked to stay below `2 * r`, so a witness need not describe a circular crosscut: admitting the
larger radii too only weakens the hypothesis, and the crosscut radii the application supplies are
among the admissible ones.

This is `EpsilonEridani.exists_tendsto_nhdsWithin_ball`, and `EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousOn_closedBall_eqOn`
is its global form, a continuous extension to the closed disc. Boundedness alone is far from
sufficient — a bounded holomorphic function need not have a limit at a given boundary point — so
the estimate is what carries the content. Neither injectivity of `f` nor any hypothesis on the
image is used, and supplying that estimate for a Riemann map of a Jordan domain is precisely what
the remaining L5 work consists of. The length–area method delivers the bound on the arc; the bound
on the collar is where local connectedness of the image boundary enters.

## Generality

In accordance with the generality bar of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, which fixes scalar `ℂ` for
every theorem added in layers L0–L6, everything below is stated for `ℂ`. The three set lemmas that
split a set by a sphere use nothing but the containments between balls and spheres, so they live in
`EpsilonEridani/Topology/MetricSpace/Cut.lean`, stated for an arbitrary pseudo-metric space, and are used
here at `ℂ`. Likewise the whole of the *near* side — that the crosscut neighbourhood is nonempty,
connected and a connected component of the cut disc, and the bound on its frontier — needs only
convexity of a ball, or for the frontier bound not even that, so it lives in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Normed/Module/Ball/Cut.lean` for a seminormed real vector space and a
pseudo-metric space respectively, and is used here at `ℂ`. For the rest the bar is not merely a
convenience: the decomposition of the *far* side is performed by the complex inversion
`z ↦ (z - ζ)⁻¹`, the
Möbius map the roadmap names for reducing circles to lines, and the analytic half is the maximum
modulus principle for holomorphic functions.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.mem_ball_iff_one_lt_two_mul_re_mul_inv` — the inversion at a boundary point carries a
  disc to a half-plane.
* `EpsilonEridani.circleMap_mem_ball_iff` — the angular description of a circular crosscut, the
  boundary-point case of the criterion `EpsilonEridani.circleMap_mem_ball_iff_sq` of
  `EpsilonEridani/Topology/Circle/Metric.lean`, which also supplies the fact that the angles form an arc.
* `EpsilonEridani.isConnected_ball_diff_closedBall` — the part of a disc outside a circular crosscut is
  connected.
* `EpsilonEridani.connectedComponentIn_ball_diff_sphere_eq_ball_diff_closedBall` — together with its
  companion `EpsilonEridani.connectedComponentIn_ball_diff_sphere_eq_ball_inter_ball` of
  `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Normed/Module/Ball/Cut.lean`, a circular crosscut separates the disc into
  exactly two connected components, the two sides being those cut out by
  `EpsilonEridani.sdiff_sphere_eq_inter_ball_union_sdiff_closedBall` and
  `EpsilonEridani.subset_inter_ball_or_subset_sdiff_closedBall` of
  `EpsilonEridani/Topology/MetricSpace/Cut.lean`.
* `EpsilonEridani.norm_sub_le_of_mem_ball_inter_ball` and
  `EpsilonEridani.norm_sub_le_of_mem_ball_inter_ball_of_differentiableOn` — the maximum modulus principle
  on a crosscut neighbourhood: a bound on the arc and on the cap is a bound inside, and its
  boundary-free form, where only holomorphy on the open disc is assumed and the cap is replaced by
  a collar of the boundary.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_tendsto_nhdsWithin_ball` and `EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousOn_closedBall_eqOn` — the
  crosscut criterion for a boundary limit, and for a continuous extension to the closed disc.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Layer L5 is absent from
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the in-progress
human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort, which stops at the mapping theorem itself, and
Mathlib has no boundary correspondence for conformal maps. So this file is new Lean formalization
rather than a temporary shim, and it consumes no L0–L3 shim: its analytic input is Mathlib's own
maximum modulus principle, `Complex.norm_le_of_forall_mem_frontier_norm_le`.

/-! ## The inversion at a boundary point -/

/-- **The inversion at a boundary point carries a disc to a half-plane.** If `ζ` lies on the circle
`sphere c r`, then a point `z ≠ ζ` lies in `ball c r` exactly when its image `(z - ζ)⁻¹` under the
inversion centred at `ζ` lies in the open half-plane `{w | 1 < 2 * ((c - ζ) * w).re}`.

This is the classical fact that a Möbius map sends a circle through the centre of the inversion to
a line, in the one form the crosscut decomposition needs: which *side* of that line the disc goes
to. The computation is `‖z - c‖ < r ↔ normSq (z - ζ) < 2 * ((z - ζ) * conj (c - ζ)).re`, obtained by
expanding `normSq ((z - ζ) - (c - ζ))` and cancelling `normSq (c - ζ) = r ^ 2`; dividing by
`normSq (z - ζ)` turns the left side into `1` and the right side into the half-plane condition. -/

/-! ## The angular description of a circular crosscut -/

/-- **A circular crosscut is an arc of angles around the direction of the centre.** For `ζ` on the
circle `sphere c r` and `ρ > 0`, the point of `sphere ζ ρ` at angle `θ` lies in `ball c r` exactly
when `ρ < 2 * r * cos (θ - arg (c - ζ))`.

This is the general criterion `EpsilonEridani.circleMap_mem_ball_iff_sq` of
`EpsilonEridani/Topology/Circle/Metric.lean` at `dist ζ c = r`, where the two squared radii cancel and the
surviving condition `ρ ^ 2 < 2 * ρ * r * cos (θ - arg (c - ζ))` may be divided by `ρ > 0`.

Nothing is assumed of `r` beyond what `dist ζ c = r` forces; for `r = 0` both sides are false.

This is deliberately not a `simp` lemma: `Metric.mem_ball` already rewrites the left-hand side to
`dist (circleMap ζ ρ θ) c < r`, so the statement is not in `simp` normal form and the `simpNF`
linter rejects the attribute. The `simp`-normal companion is
`EpsilonEridani.dist_circleMap_lt_iff`. -/

/-! ## The far side of a circular crosscut

The *near* side `ball c r ∩ ball ζ ρ` is convex, and everything about it — that it is nonempty,
connected, and a connected component of the cut disc, and that its frontier lies on the two
circles — is proved without any complex structure in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Normed/Module/Ball/Cut.lean`. What follows is the far side, which is not convex
and is where the Möbius reduction is needed. -/

/-- The inversion model of a disc punctured by a crosscut: the intersection of the open half-plane
`{w | 1 < 2 * (a * w).re}` with `ball 0 R`. It is convex for every `a` and every `R`, being an
intersection of a half-space with a ball.

No nonemptiness is claimed, and none holds in general: the intersection is empty for `R ≤ 0`, and
the half-plane itself is empty for `a = 0`. Nonemptiness in the case at hand is
`EpsilonEridani.nonempty_halfPlane_inter_ball`, which is where `ρ < 2 * r` is used. -/

continuously, `0` not being in it.

/-- **The maximum modulus principle on a crosscut neighbourhood.** A function holomorphic on the
crosscut neighbourhood and continuous up to its closure that stays within `C` of a value `a` on the
closed crosscut arc and on the boundary cap stays within `C` of `a` on the whole crosscut
neighbourhood.

The crosscut neighbourhood is a bounded open set whose frontier is covered by those two pieces
(`EpsilonEridani.frontier_ball_inter_ball_subset`), so this is Mathlib's
`Complex.norm_le_of_forall_mem_frontier_norm_le` applied to `f - a` on it. Neither injectivity of
`f` nor connectivity of anything is used. Regularity is asked for on the crosscut neighbourhood
alone rather than on the disc, which is all the maximum principle consumes; a caller holding
`DiffContOnCl ℂ f (ball c r)` supplies it by `DiffContOnCl.mono inter_subset_left`. -/

/-- **The maximum modulus principle on a crosscut neighbourhood, from interior values alone.** A
function holomorphic on `ball c r`, with *no* regularity assumed at the boundary circle, that stays
within `C` of a value `a` on the part `ball c r ∩ sphere ζ ρ` of the crosscut circle inside the disc
and on the collar `r₀ ≤ dist w c` of the crosscut neighbourhood, stays within `C` of `a` throughout
that neighbourhood.

This is `EpsilonEridani.norm_sub_le_of_mem_ball_inter_ball` applied on a slightly smaller concentric disc
`ball c s`, on whose closure `f` is continuous for free: choosing `max r₀ (dist z c) < s < r` puts
the given point `z` inside `ball c s` and the whole cap `sphere c s ∩ closedBall ζ ρ` inside the
collar, and letting `s` exhaust `r` covers the crosscut neighbourhood.

It is this form, not the frontier form, that the boundary criteria below consume. Their hypotheses
then constrain only the values `f` takes *inside* the disc, so that a boundary limit is a
conclusion rather than a restatement of an assumed continuity up to the boundary: a hypothesis
of the shape `DiffContOnCl ℂ f (ball c r)` already contains `ContinuousOn f (closedBall c r)` and
so would make the criteria vacuous. Assuming continuity only on the closure of each crosscut
neighbourhood would not help, since that closure contains `ζ` itself; hence the exhaustion. -/

/-! ## The crosscut criterion for boundary behaviour -/

/-- **The crosscut criterion, cluster-set form.** If for every `ε > 0` there is *some* radius
`ρ > 0` at which the function `f` is within `ε` of a single value on the part
`ball c r ∩ sphere ζ ρ` of the circle around `ζ` inside the disc and on a collar of the boundary,
then `f` has at most one cluster value at `ζ` along the disc.

The maximum modulus principle turns each such estimate into an oscillation bound on the crosscut
neighbourhood `ball c r ∩ ball ζ ρ`
(`EpsilonEridani.norm_sub_le_of_mem_ball_inter_ball_of_differentiableOn`), and those neighbourhoods are
exactly the traces on the disc of the balls around `ζ`, so
`EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_of_forall_exists` applies verbatim. Only the values of `f` on
the *open* disc are constrained, and only holomorphy there is assumed; note that `ζ` need not be
on the boundary circle for this statement, that `ρ`, `r₀` and `a` may all depend on `ε`, and that
`ρ` is not bounded above by `2 * r`, so a witness need not cut a circular crosscut. -/

/-- **The crosscut criterion for a boundary limit.** A bounded holomorphic function on a disc has a
limit at a boundary point `ζ`, along the disc, as soon as for every `ε > 0` there is some radius
`ρ > 0` at which it is within `ε` of a single value on the part `ball c r ∩ sphere ζ ρ` of the
circle around `ζ` inside the disc and on a collar of the boundary. As in
`EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_ball`, no upper bound on `ρ` is imposed, so a witness need not
cut a circular crosscut.

Nothing is assumed at the boundary circle itself: the input is the behaviour of `f` inside the
disc, and the limit is a conclusion. Boundedness alone is far from enough — a bounded holomorphic
function on a disc need not have any limit at a given boundary point — so the estimate `h` is what
carries the content; it is exactly the estimate the length–area method produces on the arc and
local connectedness of the image boundary produces on the collar.

The cluster set is a subsingleton by `EpsilonEridani.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_ball`, and it is nonempty
because `f` maps the disc into the compact closure of its bounded image; that is exactly what
`EpsilonEridani.exists_tendsto_of_clusterSetOn_subsingleton` needs. -/

/-- **The crosscut criterion for a continuous extension to the closed disc.** If the hypothesis of
`EpsilonEridani.exists_tendsto_nhdsWithin_ball` holds at *every* point of the boundary circle, the bounded
holomorphic function `f` extends continuously to `closedBall c r`.

This is the shape in which the Carathéodory boundary correspondence is proved: whatever geometric
hypothesis is placed on the image, it is used only to produce, at each boundary point and each
`ε`, a radius `ρ > 0` — a crosscut radius in the application, though the statement imposes no
upper bound on it — along which `f` varies by at most `ε` on `ball c r ∩ sphere ζ ρ` and on the
collar. The extension is genuinely produced here rather than assumed, since only holomorphy and
boundedness on the *open* disc are hypotheses. Nothing here asserts that the extension is
injective, which is an independent matter. -/
