# A finite-length image crosscut as a path

`Conformal/Crosscut/EndpointLimit.lean` proves that the image of a circular crosscut of finite
length has an honest limit at each of its two ends, and identifies its closure set-theoretically as
the open image crosscut together with those ends. This file packages the same curve as a
`Path`: its range is exactly that closure, it follows the usual angular parametrisation in its
interior, and that interior is injective when the holomorphic map is injective on the disc.

This is a topological input to layer **L5** of the conformal-mapping roadmap
(`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`), the Carathéodory boundary correspondence. The next
separation step joins a closed image crosscut to one of the two arcs that its endpoints cut from
the Jordan boundary. The set-level description of the closure does not by itself supply the
continuous parametrisation that such an argument needs; the path below does.

## Construction

Write

`a = arg (c - ζ) - arccos (ρ / (2r))` and
`b = arg (c - ζ) + arccos (ρ / (2r))`.

The open interval `Ioo a b` parametrises `ball c r ∩ sphere ζ ρ`. At every point of its frontier,
the endpoint-limit theorem gives a limit of `f` along the crosscut. Composing with `circleMap`
turns those into limits of the angular composite `g = f ∘ circleMap ζ ρ` at `a` and at `b`, which
is exactly the data `EpsilonEridani.Path.ofContinuousOnIoo` of `EpsilonEridani/Topology/Path/ExtendIoo.lean`
consumes: a function continuous on an open interval with a limit at each end traces a path between
those two limits, whose range is the closure of the curve
(`EpsilonEridani.Path.range_ofContinuousOnIoo`) and which follows `g` along
`AffineMap.lineMap a b : [0, 1] → [a, b]` in the interior
(`EpsilonEridani.Path.ofContinuousOnIoo_apply_of_mem_Ioo`). All the holomorphy is spent before that
point, in producing the two endpoint limits.

This construction does not need injectivity. When `f` is injective on the disc, a companion
theorem also places the endpoints on the image frontier and shows that only the two endpoints can
be identified. Interior injectivity uses only the injectivity of `f`, Mathlib's
`Complex.injOn_circleMap_of_abs_sub_le`, the fact that `b - a < 2π`, and the injectivity of
`AffineMap.lineMap a b`; the last step, that a curve injective on the interior and avoiding both
endpoint values there can repeat only between its endpoints, is
`EpsilonEridani.eq_or_eq_endpoints_of_notMem_of_forall_mem_Ioo` of the same file.

## Main result

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_path_range_eq_closure_image_ball_inter_sphere` — a finite-length circular image
  crosscut is the interior of a path whose range is its closure.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_path_range_eq_closure_image_ball_inter_sphere_of_injOn` — for a holomorphic
  injection, the path endpoints lie on the image frontier and no other values repeat.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Layer L5 is absent from
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the in-progress
human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort, which stops at the mapping theorem itself. Mathlib
supplies `Path` and the injectivity of `circleMap` on an interval shorter than a full turn; the
extension of a curve across the two ends of an open interval is packaged as a path in
`EpsilonEridani/Topology/Path/ExtendIoo.lean`. Mathlib has no boundary-crosscut or endpoint-limit result.
No Mathlib source is vendored.

/-- **At any angle landing on the closed crosscut, the limit is reached along both approaches.**
The limit of `f` along the crosscut at `circleMap ζ ρ θ` is also the limit of the angular
composite `θ ↦ f (circleMap ζ ρ θ)` along `Ioo a b`.

The angle `θ` is constrained only through `he`: it may be any angle whose point lies on the closed
crosscut, not merely one of the two endpoints. The frontier case is all that is used. -/

/-- **A finite-length circular image crosscut is the interior of a path.** Let `ζ` lie on
`sphere c r`, and let `0 < ρ < 2r`, so that `ball c r ∩ sphere ζ ρ` is a genuine circular
crosscut. If `f` is holomorphic on `ball c r` and the image crosscut has finite
`EpsilonEridani.circleImageLength`, then there are endpoints `u`, `v` and a path from `u` to `v` whose
range is exactly `closure (f '' (ball c r ∩ sphere ζ ρ))` and which has the usual angular
parametrisation on the open unit interval.

The two additional `Tendsto` conclusions identify `u` and `v` with the endpoint limits of the
crosscut. No injectivity is needed for this construction. The companion theorem
`EpsilonEridani.exists_path_range_eq_closure_image_ball_inter_sphere_of_injOn` records the stronger
frontier and no-repetition properties available when `f` is injective.

/-- **An endpoint limit of a circular image crosscut lies on the frontier of the image.** For `f`
differentiable and injective on `ball c r`, a limit of `f` along the crosscut at either endpoint of
its defining arc is a boundary point of `f '' ball c r`.

The endpoints are named by the arccos formula rather than through a local abbreviation, so the
statement stands on its own. -/

/-- **A path traced along an arc by an injective map is injective on the open unit interval, and
sends it into the image.** For a circle of nonzero radius `ρ`, suppose `g` is injective on `S`,
the arc `circleMap ζ ρ '' Ioo a b` stays inside `S` and is no longer than a full turn, and `γ` is
given on `Ioo 0 1` by `g` composed with the affine parametrisation of `Ioo a b`. Then `γ` is
injective on `Ioo 0 1` and maps it into `g '' S`.

Nothing is asserted at the two endpoints, where `γ` may well repeat a value. -/

/-- **An injective finite-length circular image crosscut has no repetitions except possibly at its
endpoints.** Under the hypotheses of
`EpsilonEridani.exists_path_range_eq_closure_image_ball_inter_sphere`, assume additionally that `f` is
injective on `ball c r`. Then the endpoints of the resulting path lie on
`frontier (f '' ball c r)` and remain identified by their endpoint limits, its interior is
injective, and no endpoint value occurs in the interior. Thus the only possible repeated value is
a common value of the two endpoints.

The endpoints need not be distinct: before the Carathéodory boundary theorem, the hypotheses do
not exclude an image crosscut closing up at the boundary.
