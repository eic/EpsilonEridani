# The boundary correspondence of a conformal map

A conformal map — a holomorphic injection `f` on an open set `U ⊆ ℂ` — is a *proper* map onto its
image: the preimage of a compact subset of `f '' U` is a compact subset of `U`. Properness is the
mechanism that forces the boundary to go to the boundary, and it is the first step of the
Carathéodory boundary correspondence, layer **L5** of the conformal-mapping roadmap. This file
proves it, deduces that a point approached from inside `U` is carried out of every compact subset
of `f '' U`, and packages the consequences for a map that *does* extend continuously to `closure U`:
such an extension carries `frontier U` into `frontier (f '' U)`, *onto* it once `U` is in addition
bounded, and — when the extension is injective on `closure U` — is a homeomorphism of the closures.

The existence of the continuous extension is the hard, hypothesis-laden half of Carathéodory's
theorem (it needs the boundary of the image to be a Jordan curve, or at least locally connected),
and it is **not** proved here; the L5 milestone is that existence statement. What is proved here is
everything that holds unconditionally, plus the packaging that turns the extension, once it is
available, into the boundary homeomorphism the milestone asks for.

## The argument

Properness is the inverse function theorem in disguise. An injective holomorphic map on an open set
is an open partial homeomorphism onto its image
(`DifferentiableOn.toOpenPartialHomeomorph`), and `U ∩ f ⁻¹' K` is exactly the image of `K`
under its inverse `Function.invFunOn f U`, so it is compact as the continuous image of a compact
set. Everything else follows from that one fact. If `z i → w` with `z i ∈ U` and `w ∉ U`, then
`f (z i)` cannot lie in a compact `K ⊆ f '' U` frequently: otherwise `z i` would frequently lie in
the compact — hence closed — set `U ∩ f ⁻¹' K`, which would then contain the limit `w`.

For a boundary point `w ∈ frontier U`, the filter `𝓝[U] w` is the one to run this along: it is
`NeBot` precisely because `w ∈ closure U`. If a continuous extension `F` had `F w` inside the open
set `f '' U`, then a small closed ball around `F w` would be a compact subset of `f '' U` that
`f = F` enters eventually along `𝓝[U] w` by continuity, and leaves eventually by properness —
impossible on a nontrivial filter. Hence `F w ∉ f '' U`, while `F w ∈ closure (f '' U)` because `F`
is continuous on `closure U`; that is membership in `frontier (f '' U)`.

The argument beyond the two holomorphic inputs — the open mapping theorem, through
`EpsilonEridani.isOpen_image_of_differentiableOn_of_injOn`, and its packaging as an open partial
homeomorphism — is purely topological, and no continuity hypothesis on the inverse of `f` appears
precisely because those two supply it. In accordance with the generality bar of
`ConformalMapping/README.md`, which fixes scalar `ℂ` for every theorem added in layers L0–L6, the
results are stated for conformal maps of `ℂ` rather than for an abstract proper map.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isCompact_inter_preimage_of_differentiableOn_of_injOn` — a conformal map is proper onto
  its image: `U ∩ f ⁻¹' K` is compact for compact `K ⊆ f '' U`.
* `EpsilonEridani.eventually_notMem_of_tendsto_of_notMem` — a family in `U` converging to a point outside
  `U`, in particular to a boundary point, is carried out of every compact subset of the image.
* `EpsilonEridani.notMem_image_of_mem_frontier` — a continuous extension to `closure U` sends `frontier U`
  outside `f '' U`.
* `EpsilonEridani.image_closure_eq_closure_image` — for bounded `U`, a continuous extension carries
  `closure U` onto `closure (f '' U)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.image_frontier_subset_frontier_image` — a continuous extension carries `frontier U` into
  `frontier (f '' U)`; no boundedness is needed.
* `EpsilonEridani.image_frontier_eq_frontier_image` — for bounded `U`, that inclusion is an equality: a
  continuous extension carries `frontier U` onto `frontier (f '' U)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.bijOn_closure_closure_image` and `EpsilonEridani.closureHomeomorph` — for bounded `U`, an
  extension injective on `closure U` is a homeomorphism `closure U ≃ₜ closure (f '' U)`.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Mathlib has no boundary correspondence for conformal maps, and — unlike the L0–L3 material — layer
L5 is absent from [mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the
in-progress human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort, which stops at the mapping theorem itself.
So this file is new Lean formalization rather than a temporary shim. It does consume the L0–L3 shims
`EpsilonEridani.isOpen_image_of_differentiableOn_of_injOn` and
`DifferentiableOn.toOpenPartialHomeomorph`, which are to be refactored onto Mathlib once the
upstream work lands.

/-- **A conformal map is proper onto its image.** If `f` is holomorphic and injective on an open
set `U` and `K ⊆ f '' U` is compact, then the part of the preimage of `K` lying in `U` is compact.

Properness is what distinguishes `f '' U` as the *whole* image: the preimage cannot escape to the
boundary of `U` while its image stays in a compact part of `f '' U`. -/

/-! ## Continuous extensions to the closure -/

/-- **A continuous extension of a conformal map sends the boundary off the image.** If `F` is
continuous on `closure U` and agrees with `f` on `U`, then `F` maps no boundary point of `U` into
the open set `f '' U`.

For open `U` the hypothesis `w ∈ frontier U` is `w ∈ closure U` together with `w ∉ U`; both halves
are used, the first to make the filter `𝓝[U] w` nontrivial and the second to invoke
`EpsilonEridani.eventually_notMem_of_tendsto_of_notMem`. -/

/-! ## The boundary homeomorphism -/

/-- **An injective continuous extension is a bijection of the closures.** If `F` is continuous on
`closure U` for a bounded `U`, agrees with `f` on `U`, and is injective on `closure U`, then it maps
`closure U` bijectively onto `closure (f '' U)`. The set-level form of
`EpsilonEridani.closureHomeomorph`: injectivity is the hypothesis, and surjectivity onto
`closure (f '' U)` is `EpsilonEridani.image_closure_eq_closure_image`. Neither holomorphy of `f` nor
openness of `U` is needed; a conformal `f` is the intended application. -/

    (hFc : ContinuousOn F (closure U)) (hFf : EqOn F f U) (hFi : InjOn F (closure U)) :
    BijOn F (closure U) (closure (f '' U)) :=
  (image_closure_eq_closure_image hUb hFc hFf) ▸ hFi.bijOn_image

/-- **The homeomorphism of closures induced by an injective continuous extension.** If `F` is
continuous on `closure U` for a bounded `U`, agrees with `f` on `U`, and is injective on
`closure U`, then `F` is a homeomorphism of `closure U` onto `closure (f '' U)`. Neither holomorphy
of `f` nor openness of `U` is assumed; the intended instance is a conformal map `f` on an open `U`
together with a continuous extension `F`.

For a Riemann map of a Jordan domain this is the conclusion the Carathéodory correspondence
(layer **L5**) asks for; what that milestone adds is the *existence* of such an `F`, which is not
proved here. Continuity of the inverse is free: `closure U` is compact and `ℂ` is Hausdorff.

The definition is not exposed; `EpsilonEridani.coe_closureHomeomorph_apply` and
`EpsilonEridani.coe_closureHomeomorph_symm_apply` are its characterizations. -/
