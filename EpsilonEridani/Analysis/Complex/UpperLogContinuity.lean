# Continuity of `arg` and `log` on the closed upper half-plane

The principal argument and logarithm are continuous on the punctured closed upper
half-plane `{z | 0 ≤ im z ∧ z ≠ 0}`. This strengthens Mathlib's continuity on the open
slit plane: the negative real axis is allowed because the approach is confined to
nonnegative imaginary parts, where `arg` agrees with the continuous `arccos` formula.
It is the boundary-tolerant ingredient for logarithmic primitives along contours that
touch the slit-plane boundary.
