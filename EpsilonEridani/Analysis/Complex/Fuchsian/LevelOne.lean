# The level-one modular group as a cofinite Fuchsian group

The effective group acting on the upper half-plane at level one is the image of
`PSL(2, ℤ)` in `PSL(2, ℝ)`, not `SL(2, ℤ)`: the latter still contains the central matrix
`-I`, which acts trivially. This file proves that the projective image is a discrete cofinite
subgroup of `PSL(2, ℝ)`.

The standard open modular fundamental domain is transported from the `PSL(2, ℤ)` action to
its image in `PSL(2, ℝ)`. Its finite hyperbolic area then proves cofiniteness. This supplies the
effective level-one input for quotient and compactification constructions.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ModularGroup.isFundamentalDomain_fdo_psl2zToPSL2RRange`: the standard open modular
  domain is a fundamental domain for the projective image in `PSL(2, ℝ)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ModularGroup.isCofinite_psl2zToPSL2RRange`: that image is a cofinite Fuchsian group.
