# The free-locus quotient of a Fuchsian group

Let `Γ ≤ PSL(2, ℝ)` be a discrete subgroup. Its free locus `EpsilonEridani.freeLocus Γ ℍ`, the set of
points of the upper half-plane with trivial stabilizer, is open and `Γ`-invariant, and `Γ` acts on
it freely, properly discontinuously and by biholomorphisms. The orbit space of the free locus is
therefore a Hausdorff, second countable Riemann surface, whose complex charts are pushed forward
along the orbit projection, and the orbit projection is a covering map and a local
biholomorphism.

At a point with nontrivial stabilizer, an elliptic point, the orbit projection of the whole upper
half-plane is not a covering map; its local model there is the power map `u ↦ u ^ m` of
`EpsilonEridani.rootsOfUnityBallQuotientHomeomorph`.

## Main declarations

* `Subgroup.isLocalDiffeomorph_quotientMk_freeLocus`: the orbit projection of the free locus is a
  local biholomorphism.
