# The zero count of a holomorphic function on a disc

The zero count of `f` on an open disc is the finitely supported sum
`∑ᶠ z ∈ ball c R, analyticOrderNatAt f z`. It is what the argument principle produces — through
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_divisor` and the bridge
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.divisor_eq_analyticOrderNatAt` — and what Rouché's theorem
(`EpsilonEridani.rouche_symm`) and Hurwitz's theorem (`EpsilonEridani.hurwitz`) compare. This file collects the
three facts about that sum which those consumers need, none of which mentions either theorem.

Care is needed about points of *infinite* order, where `f` vanishes identically nearby:
`analyticOrderNatAt` reads `0` there, exactly as it does where `f` does not vanish at all, so the
count does not see such a point. That is why detecting a zero from a vanishing count
(`EpsilonEridani.finsum_analyticOrderNatAt_ball_eq_zero_iff`) needs a hypothesis ruling infinite order
out. One point of the closed disc at which `f` is nonzero is enough: the disc is convex, hence
preconnected, so `AnalyticOnNhd.analyticOrderAt_ne_top_of_isPreconnected` propagates the finite
order there to every point.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.analyticOrderNatAt_le_finsum_ball` — the order of vanishing at a single point of the
  open disc is at most the total count.
* `EpsilonEridani.finsum_analyticOrderNatAt_ball_eq_zero_of_forall_ne_zero` — a zero-free function has
  count `0`.
* `EpsilonEridani.finsum_analyticOrderNatAt_ball_eq_zero_iff` — conversely, given a point of the closed
  disc where `f` does not vanish, a count of `0` means there is no zero in the open disc at all.

/-- The order of vanishing at a single point of the open disc is at most the total zero count.
Both sides read `0` at a point of infinite order, so the bound is trivially true there too.

The finiteness the sum needs is `MeromorphicOn.divisor_ball_support_finite`, transported along
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.divisor_eq_analyticOrderNatAt`. -/

/-- **The zero count detects zeros.** For `f` holomorphic on `closedBall c R` and nonvanishing at
*some* point of that closed disc, the count `∑ᶠ z ∈ ball c R, analyticOrderNatAt f z` vanishes
precisely when `f` has no zero in the open disc.

The nontrivial direction is that a zero contributes a *nonzero* order. That fails without a
hypothesis of this kind: `analyticOrderNatAt` sends a point of infinite order to `0`, so the
identically zero function has count `0` while vanishing everywhere. A single point of
nonvanishing rules that out, the closed disc being preconnected. -/
