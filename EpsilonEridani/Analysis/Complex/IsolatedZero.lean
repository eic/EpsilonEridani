# Estimates near an isolated zero

A lower bound on a circle around a point at whose centre the function has its only zero, and two
ways of concluding that the analytic order at a point is finite.

The first two are the standing hypotheses of every Rouché comparison made on such a disc: both
`EpsilonEridani.Analysis.Complex.Conformal.LocalDegree` and
`EpsilonEridani.Analysis.Complex.Conformal.Hurwitz` set up such a comparison, and each needs the same
two facts about the disc before Rouché can be applied. The third has no Rouché content at all: it
draws the same finiteness from the global hypothesis a zero count comes with, that the zeros in an
open set lie in a finite set, and serves the arbitrary-cycle argument principle
(`EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_nullHomologous_of_analyticOnNhd`). No result here mentions
Rouché's theorem, so this module does not import it:

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_pos_le_norm_of_mem_sphere`: on the bounding circle the function is bounded below
  by a positive constant — this is what a competitor has to beat.
* `EpsilonEridani.analyticOrderAt_ne_top_of_forall_ne_zero`: the analytic order at the centre is finite,
  so the count Rouché produces is a natural number rather than `⊤`.
* `EpsilonEridani.analyticOrderAt_ne_top_of_zeros_subset`: the same finiteness under the hypothesis a
  global zero count comes with, that the zeros in an open set lie in a finite set.

They are separated here only because several files need them.

/-- A continuous zero-free function on a sphere is bounded below there by a positive constant.

No hypothesis on the radius. At `ρ = 0` the sphere is the set of points at zero distance from
`a` — the single point `a` when `E` is a metric space, but not in general, since the domain is
only assumed pseudometric. For `ρ < 0` it is empty, nothing is attained, and the bound holds
vacuously. -/

/-- **A function with no zero off the centre does not vanish identically there.** If `f` is
nonzero at every point of an open ball of positive radius other than its centre `a`, then `f`
has finite analytic order at `a`.

Nothing is assumed about `f a`, which may or may not be zero, nor about analyticity of `f`. -/

/-- **A function whose zeros are confined to a finite set has finite order.** If every zero of `f`
in an open set `U` lies in a finite set `S`, then `f` does not vanish identically near any point of
`U`, so `analyticOrderAt f z ≠ ⊤` there.

The point `z` itself is allowed to be a zero, indeed to lie in `S`. This is the finite-set form
of `EpsilonEridani.analyticOrderAt_ne_top_of_forall_ne_zero`. -/
