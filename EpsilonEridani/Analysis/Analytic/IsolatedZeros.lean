# The zero set of an analytic function

An analytic function that does not vanish identically has isolated zeros, and this file records
what that gives on a compact set: only finitely many zeros lie there. It is the fact any zero
count rests on, and it mentions neither the analytic order nor any particular field, so it lives
apart from both the order calculus of `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.Analytic.Order` and the complex-specific
estimates of `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.Complex.IsolatedZero`. The name follows Mathlib's own
`Mathlib.Analysis.Analytic.IsolatedZeros`, where the identity principle and the codiscreteness of
the zero set live.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.finite_setOf_mem_and_eq_zero_of_isCompact`: an analytic function somewhere nonzero on
  a preconnected set has finitely many zeros in any compact subset of it.

## References

* The AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` valence-formula development
  (`ForMathlib/ValenceFormula/PVChain/ResidueSideInfra.lean`), whose modular-form-specific
  finiteness this generalises.

/-- **An analytic function somewhere nonzero has finitely many zeros in a compact.** If `f` is
analytic on a neighbourhood of a preconnected set `U` and nonzero at some point of `U`, then
every compact subset of `U` contains only finitely many zeros of `f`.

Generalized from the modular-form-specific finiteness of the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms`
valence-formula development (`ForMathlib/ValenceFormula/PVChain/ResidueSideInfra.lean`) to
arbitrary analytic functions on a preconnected set. -/
