# Pontryagin characters are positive-definite atoms

A continuous character of a topological abelian group becomes a continuous function on the
additive group after transporting `G` to `Multiplicative G`. This file proves that every such
character is a continuous subtraction-positive-definite function. The character-level fact is
an atomic input for Fourier analysis on locally compact abelian groups; it does not assert a
measure-representation or Pontryagin-duality theorem.

## Main declarations

* `PontryaginDual.isPositiveDefiniteSub`: a continuous Pontryagin character is a
  continuous positive-definite function in the additive subtraction form.
