# Berg--Christensen--Ressel representing measures as time kernels

Let `V` be a finite-dimensional real inner-product space. A measure `μ` on `V` together with a
kernel `κ` from `V` to `ℝ≥0` assembles into a measure `EpsilonEridani.swapCompProd μ κ` on `ℝ≥0 × V`,
and conversely every *finite* measure on `ℝ≥0 × V` admits such a disintegration over its spatial
marginal, the Markov kernel being unique only up to equality almost everywhere for that marginal.
That assembly is general measure theory and lives in
`EpsilonEridani.Probability.Kernel.Composition.Swap`; this file reads the Berg--Christensen--Ressel
representation through it.

The point is that the spatial slice of `swapCompProd μ κ` at time `t` is computed by a
*fibrewise Laplace transform*: it is `μ` weighted by the density
`q ↦ ∫⁻ p, exp (-t p) ∂(κ q)` (`EpsilonEridani.spatialSlice_swapCompProd`). Since a finite
measure on `ℝ≥0 × V` represents a function `F` exactly when its spatial slices are the Bochner
measures of the time slices of `F`
(`EpsilonEridani.representsLaplaceFourier_iff_forall_spatialSlice_eq`), and since those Bochner
measures decrease in time and are therefore all absolutely continuous with respect to the one at
time `0` (`EpsilonEridani.bochnerMeasure_timeSlice_absolutelyContinuous`), the existence half of the
representation theorem becomes a *fibrewise* Bernstein problem: find a Markov kernel whose
fibrewise Laplace transforms are the Radon--Nikodym densities
`d(bochnerMeasure (F (t, ·))) / d(bochnerMeasure (F (0, ·)))`
(`EpsilonEridani.representsLaplaceFourier_swapCompProd_of_ae_rnDeriv`). The reduction is exact:
`EpsilonEridani.exists_representsLaplaceFourier_iff_exists_timeKernel` states it as an equivalence, so
nothing is lost in passing from the measure to the kernel.

The time-regularity input that a fibrewise Bernstein argument consumes — antitonicity, the
resulting absolute continuity, continuity and alternating finite differences of the slab
masses — is in `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.PositiveDefinite.SemigroupGroup.Time.Slice.Measure`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.spatialSlice_swapCompProd`: **the spatial slices of an assembled measure are the
  fibrewise Laplace transforms of its kernel**,
  `spatialSlice (swapCompProd μ κ) t = μ.withDensity (Kernel.laplaceTransform κ t)`. The
  measure-level transform `EpsilonEridani.laplaceTransformENN` and its identification with the usual
  real-valued Laplace transform are in the infrastructure under
  `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.CompletelyMonotone.Laplace`.
* `EpsilonEridani.representsLaplaceFourier_swapCompProd`: a kernel whose fibrewise Laplace
  transforms are the densities of the spatial Bochner measures produces a
  Berg--Christensen--Ressel representing measure.
* `EpsilonEridani.representsLaplaceFourier_swapCompProd_of_ae_rnDeriv`: the same criterion phrased
  using Radon--Nikodym derivatives.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_representsLaplaceFourier_iff_exists_timeKernel`: **the reduction**, as an
  equivalence between the existence of a representing measure and the existence of such a
  Markov kernel.

fibrewise Laplace transform of `κ` at every time `t` is a density of the spatial Bochner measure
at `t` against the one at time `0`, then assembling `κ` over that time-`0` measure produces a

constrained: positive definiteness and continuity are what make the spatial Bochner measures
represent them. -/

/-- **The existence half of the Berg--Christensen--Ressel representation is a kernel problem.**
A function on `ℝ≥0 × V` whose time slices are continuous and positive-definite has a
representing finite measure if and only if there is a Markov kernel from `V` to `ℝ≥0` whose
fibrewise Laplace transform at each time `t` is a density of the spatial Bochner measure at time
`t` against the one at time `0`.

The forward direction disintegrates a representing measure over its spatial marginal, which is
the time-`0` Bochner measure; the backward direction assembles the kernel into a measure and
checks its spatial slices. -/
