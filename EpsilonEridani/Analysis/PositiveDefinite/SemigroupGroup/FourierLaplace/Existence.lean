# The Berg--Christensen--Ressel representation theorem

A bounded continuous positive-definite function on the involutive semigroup `ℝ≥0 × V`, with `V` a
finite-dimensional real inner-product space, is the Laplace--Fourier transform of a unique finite
measure on `ℝ≥0 × V`. This file proves the existence half and packages it with the uniqueness half
of `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.PositiveDefinite.SemigroupGroup.FourierLaplace.Uniqueness` into the
equivalence `EpsilonEridani.bcr_semigroup_bochner`.

Every ingredient is already in place, and the proof here is the assembly.

* Freezing the time variable and applying Bochner's theorem on `V` turns `F` into a family of
  finite spatial measures, and the representation holds exactly when that family is the family of
  Laplace-weighted spatial slices of a single measure
  (`EpsilonEridani.representsLaplaceFourier_iff_forall_spatialSlice_eq`). Disintegrating over the spatial
  marginal reduces this to producing a *kernel* from `V` to `ℝ≥0` whose fibrewise Laplace
  transforms are the densities of the spatial measures against the one at time `0`
  (`EpsilonEridani.exists_representsLaplaceFourier_iff_exists_timeKernel`).
* Almost every fibre of `EpsilonEridani.timeSliceDensity`, the right-continuous version of that family of
  densities, is a completely monotone function of time
  (`EpsilonEridani.ae_isContinuousCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_timeSliceDensity`), normalized at time `0`.
* The Hausdorff--Bernstein--Widder theorem therefore represents each such fibre by a finite measure
  on `ℝ≥0`, and those measures depend measurably on the fibre, so they assemble into
  `EpsilonEridani.bernsteinMeasureKernel`.

The only step needing care is that "almost every fibre" is not "every fibre", while a kernel must
be defined at every point: the density is corrected to `0` on a measurable null set containing the
exceptional fibres, which changes neither the Bernstein measures elsewhere nor the resulting
representation.

/-- **The Berg--Christensen--Ressel representation theorem** (Berg--Christensen--Ressel 4.1.13).
A function on the involutive semigroup `ℝ≥0 × V`, for `V` a finite-dimensional real inner-product
space, is positive definite, continuous and bounded **if and only if** it is the Laplace--Fourier
transform of a unique finite measure on `ℝ≥0 × V`:

`F (t, a) = ∫ (p, q), exp (-t p) * exp (-2πi⟪a, q⟫) dμ (p, q)`.

The forward direction is `EpsilonEridani.exists_representsLaplaceFourier` together with the transform
injectivity of `EpsilonEridani.RepresentsLaplaceFourier.unique`; the converse direction is the elementary
fact that such a transform is positive definite, continuous, and bounded by the total mass. -/
