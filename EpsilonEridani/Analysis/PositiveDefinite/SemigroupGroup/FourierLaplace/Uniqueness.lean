# Uniqueness of the Berg--Christensen--Ressel representing measure

For a *finite-dimensional* real inner product space `V`, the Berg--Christensen--Ressel
representation writes a bounded continuous positive-definite function on the involutive
semigroup `ℝ≥0 × V` as the Laplace--Fourier transform

`F (t, a) = ∫ (p, q), exp (-t p) * exp (-2πi⟪a, q⟫) ∂μ`

of a finite measure `μ` on `ℝ≥0 × V`. This file supplies the **uniqueness half**: a finite
measure on `ℝ≥0 × V` is determined by its Laplace--Fourier transform. Uniqueness needs no
finite-dimensionality — a complete, second-countable `V` with its Borel σ-algebra suffices —
and it is independent of the existence half, which consumes Bochner's theorem on the
finite-dimensional `V`; the transform itself and the representation predicate live in
`EpsilonEridani.Analysis.PositiveDefinite.SemigroupGroup.FourierLaplace.Transform`, which both halves
share.

The proof separates the two variables. The characteristic function of the spatial slice at
time `t` (`EpsilonEridani.charFun_spatialSlice`) is, after the `-2π` rescaling of Mathlib's Fourier
convention, the Laplace--Fourier transform at time `t`; Fourier uniqueness for finite measures
on `V` therefore pins down every spatial slice. That a finite measure on `ℝ≥0 × V` is in turn
determined by its spatial slices is `EpsilonEridani.Measure.ext_of_forall_spatialSlice_eq`, proved
through Laplace determinacy in the time variable.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Measure.ext_of_forall_laplaceFourierTransform_eq`: **finite measures on `ℝ≥0 × V`
  are determined by their Laplace--Fourier transforms**. This is the statement the roadmap
  calls `laplaceFourier_unique`.
* `EpsilonEridani.RepresentsLaplaceFourier.unique`: a function has at most one representing finite
  measure.

This is the uniqueness half of the Berg--Christensen--Ressel representation theorem; the
roadmap calls it `laplaceFourier_unique`. Its proof uses no positive-definiteness: it is pure
transform injectivity, Fourier in the spatial variable and Laplace in the time variable. -/
