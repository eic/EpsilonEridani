# The spatial Bochner measures of a Berg--Christensen--Ressel positive-definite function

Let `F` be a bounded continuous positive-definite function on the involutive semigroup
`ℝ≥0 × V`, with `V` a finite-dimensional real inner-product space. Freezing the time variable
leaves the continuous positive-definite function `F (t, ·)` on `V`, so Bochner's theorem produces
a finite measure `bochnerMeasure (F (t, ·))` on `V`. The Berg--Christensen--Ressel representation
`F (t, a) = ∫ (p, q), exp (-t p) * exp (-2πi⟪a, q⟫) ∂μ` prescribes exactly these measures as the
spatial slices of `μ` (`EpsilonEridani.representsLaplaceFourier_iff_forall_spatialSlice_eq`), so the
existence half of the representation is the problem of realizing the family `t ↦ bochnerMeasure
(F (t, ·))` as the Laplace-weighted slices of a single measure on `ℝ≥0 × V`.

This file develops the time regularity of that family, which is what a Bernstein-type argument
consumes. The input is the alternating time-difference positivity of `Time/Difference.lean`: for
every step `h`, the function `(t, v) ↦ F (t, v) - F (t + h, v)` is again bounded, continuous and
positive definite. Bochner's theorem is additive, so the Bochner measure of a time slice splits
as the Bochner measure of that difference plus the Bochner measure of the translated slice. Three
consequences follow.

* The family decreases in time, so each slab mass `t ↦ (bochnerMeasure (F (t, ·))).real B` is
  antitone and bounded by `(F (0, 0)).re`.
* Each slab mass is *continuous*: a decrease of the mass of `B` between two times is dominated by
  the decrease of the total mass, which is the continuous function `t ↦ (F (t, 0)).re`.
* Every mixed alternating difference of a slab mass is nonnegative, since it is again the mass of
  `B` under the Bochner measure of the corresponding list time difference of `F`.

Together the last two say that each slab mass is a bounded continuous function on `[0,∞)` all of
whose alternating finite differences have the sign `(-1)ⁿ`, the hypothesis of the
Hausdorff--Bernstein--Widder theorem in its difference form. The reverse reading is already
available for a function that *is* represented
(`EpsilonEridani.RepresentsLaplaceFourier.representsLaplace_bochnerMeasure`).

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.bochnerMeasure_timeSlice_eq_add`: the Bochner measure of a time slice splits as the
  Bochner measure of a time difference plus the Bochner measure of the translated slice.
* `EpsilonEridani.bochnerMeasure_timeSlice_antitone` and
  `EpsilonEridani.bochnerMeasure_timeSlice_real_antitone`: the family of Bochner measures, and each of
  its slab masses, decrease in time.
* `EpsilonEridani.bochnerMeasure_timeSlice_absolutelyContinuous` and
  `EpsilonEridani.withDensity_rnDeriv_bochnerMeasure_timeSlice`: consequently every member of the
  family is absolutely continuous with respect to the one at time `0`, and is recovered from it
  by a Radon--Nikodym derivative.
* `EpsilonEridani.bochnerMeasure_timeSlice_real_univ`, `EpsilonEridani.bochnerMeasure_timeSlice_real_le` and
  `EpsilonEridani.isBounded_range_bochnerMeasure_timeSlice_real`: the total mass is `(F (t, 0)).re`, and
  every slab mass is bounded by `(F (0, 0)).re`, hence has bounded range.
* `EpsilonEridani.sub_bochnerMeasure_timeSlice_real_le_sub_timeAxis_re` and
  `EpsilonEridani.continuous_bochnerMeasure_timeSlice_real`: a slab mass drops by at most the drop of
  the total mass, so it is a continuous function of the time.
* `EpsilonEridani.bochnerMeasure_timeSlice_real_listTimeDifference`: every mixed forward difference of a
  slab mass is the mass of the corresponding list time difference of `F`, up to its alternating
  sign.
* `EpsilonEridani.isDifferenceCompletelyMonotone_bochnerMeasure_timeSlice_real`: after extending time from
  `ℝ≥0` to `ℝ` by `Real.toNNReal`, every slab mass is completely monotone in the
  finite-difference sense.

/-- **Splitting a time slice along a time difference.** For a bounded continuous
Berg--Christensen--Ressel positive-definite function `F`, the Bochner measure of the slice at
