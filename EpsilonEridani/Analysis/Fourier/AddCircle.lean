# The continuous characters of the circle are the Fourier monomials

Mathlib's `fourier n : C(AddCircle T, ℂ)` is developed as a family of `L²` monomials: the lemmas
about it record how it behaves in the *index* `n` (`fourier_add`, `fourier_neg`) and what it
contributes to the Fourier basis. Read the other way, as a family of *characters* of the group
`AddCircle T` indexed by `n`, the two facts a representation-theoretic consumer needs are that the
family is **faithful** (distinct indices give distinct characters, so the corresponding
one-dimensional representations are pairwise inequivalent) and that it is **exhaustive** (there are
no other continuous characters). This file proves both, and packages them as an isomorphism of
groups between `Multiplicative ℤ` and the Pontryagin dual of the circle group.

Both halves need the period to be nondegenerate, and they need it to differing extents.
Faithfulness holds as soon as `T ≠ 0`, and that hypothesis is carried explicitly. Exhaustiveness
rests on Mathlib's Fourier analysis on `AddCircle T`, which is set up under `[Fact (0 < T)]`, so
that instance is assumed for the classification results and for the isomorphism of groups.

Faithfulness is elementary: two monomials already differ at the point `T / 2 / (m - n)`.
Exhaustiveness is where analysis enters. A continuous character `χ` is in particular a nonzero
continuous function, so some Fourier coefficient `fourierCoeff χ n` is nonzero — that is Mathlib's
`fourierBasis`, a Hilbert basis of `L²`, together with the injectivity of the map
`C(AddCircle T, ℂ) → L²`. Translating that coefficient by `y` and using that both `fourier (-n)`
and `χ` turn a sum into a product rewrites `fourierCoeff χ n` as
`fourier (-n) y * χ y * fourierCoeff χ n`, whence `fourier (-n) y * χ y = 1`, and therefore
`χ y = fourier n y`.

Nothing here assumes that `χ` takes values in the unit circle: on a compact group that is
automatic, and here it comes out as a corollary, since a continuous character *is* a Fourier
monomial.

`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Circle.lean` reads this classification for the circle group
`Multiplicative (AddCircle T)` with `[Fact (0 < T)]`, where the group is compact and the statement
becomes that the continuous representations of the circle on `ℂ` are exactly the Fourier ones.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.fourierAddChar`: the `n`-th Fourier monomial as a bundled additive character
  `AddChar (AddCircle T) ℂ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.fourierPontryaginDual`: the `n`-th Fourier monomial as an element of the Pontryagin dual
  `PontryaginDual (Multiplicative (AddCircle T))` of the circle group, i.e. as a continuous
  homomorphism to the unit circle.
* `EpsilonEridani.fourierPontryaginDualEquiv`: the resulting isomorphism of groups between
  `Multiplicative ℤ` and that Pontryagin dual.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.fourier_injective`: `n ↦ fourier n` is injective, so distinct indices give distinct
  characters.
* `ContinuousMap.eq_zero_of_forall_fourierCoeff_eq_zero`: a continuous function on the circle all
  of whose Fourier coefficients vanish is the zero function.
* `AddChar.exists_fourierAddChar_eq`: **every continuous additive character of the circle is a
  Fourier monomial.**
* `AddChar.norm_apply_eq_one_of_continuous`: consequently a continuous additive character of the
  circle takes values of modulus one.
