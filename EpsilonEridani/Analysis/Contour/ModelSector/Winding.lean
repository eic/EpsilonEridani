# The valence-formula winding values

The generic circular-arc index integrals — `indexIntegral_arc_interval`, `indexIntegral_arc` and
`windingNumber_circle` — are `circleMap` results rather than model-sector ones and live in
`EpsilonEridani.Analysis.Contour.Winding.Number.Circle`, which this module re-exports so that imports of
this path keep working.

What remains here are the two arc values the valence formula names by their points. Their
*statements* are the generic arc computation at `α = π` and `α = π/3`; the names record the role
each value plays downstream, which is why they sit here rather than in the generic circle module.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_at_i` — the semicircle value `½`, the coefficient of `ord_i f`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_at_rho` — the `π/3`-arc value `1/6`, per corner.

`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Contour/ModelSector/` retains the genuinely model-sector material:
`Corner.lean` (the two-ray corner) and `Closed.lean` (the assembled sector and its winding number).

## Provenance

Migrated and adapted from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project (the sector-geometry material of
`ForMathlib/HungerbuhlerWasem/Crossing.lean`), specialised to the raw-function
(`γ : ℝ → ℂ` on `[a, b]`) design of the contour-integration roadmap.

/-- **The winding number `½` at `i`** — the coefficient of `ord_i(f)` in the valence formula. The
semicircle (`[0, π]`) specialization of `indexIntegral_arc` (`π / 2π = ½`): `i` is a
*smooth* boundary point of the fundamental domain, so the valence contour indents around it by a
**semicircle** (opening angle `α = π`). The statement is the generic arc computation; the point `i`
names its downstream valence-formula role. -/

/-- **The winding number `1/6` at `ρ`** — the per-corner coefficient in the valence formula. The
`[0, π/3]` specialization of `indexIntegral_arc` (`(π/3) / 2π = 1/6`): `ρ` is a `π/3` corner
of the fundamental domain, so the contour indents around it by a `π/3` arc, and the two such corners
(`ρ` and `ρ+1`) each contribute `1/6`, summing to the `1/3` coefficient of `ord_ρ(f)`. The statement
is the generic arc computation; the point `ρ` names its downstream valence-formula role. -/
