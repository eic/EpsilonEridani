# Excising the corner of a model sector

`EpsilonEridani.Contour.exciseCrossing` deletes a parameter window from a curve and caps it with a
circular arc, and `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_eq_exciseCrossing_add` accounts exactly for the
winding number that the surgery moves. This file runs that surgery on the one crossing whose
geometry is completely known: the corner of the model sector `EpsilonEridani.Contour.modelSector` of
radius `r` and opening angle `α`, whose two rays leave the corner at the angles `φ + α` and `φ`.

Deleting the window `[-ε, ε]` about the corner and capping it with the arc of the circle of radius
`ε` running from angle `φ + α` back to angle `φ` leaves a closed curve of winding number `0`
(`EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_eq_zero_exciseCrossing_modelSector`). Equivalently, the sector's
entire index `α / 2π` is the local contribution of its crossing — the model case of the
identification that Hungerbühler–Wasem Proposition 2.2 asserts for a general immersion, and hence
an acceptance test for the surgery.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_eq_zero_exciseCrossing_modelSector` — excising the corner of a
  model sector leaves winding number `0`.

## Provenance

No formalization is vendored; the statement is a direct application of
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_eq_exciseCrossing_add` to the model sector already in the tree.

## References

/-- **Excising the corner of a model sector leaves nothing.** The model sector of radius `r` and
opening angle `α` crosses its own corner along two straight radii; deleting the window `[-ε, ε]`
and capping it with the arc from angle `φ + α` back to angle `φ` produces a closed curve of winding
number `0`.

Equivalently, the sector's entire index `α / 2π` is the local contribution of its crossing, which is
the model case of the identification that HW Proposition 2.2 asserts for a general immersion. -/
