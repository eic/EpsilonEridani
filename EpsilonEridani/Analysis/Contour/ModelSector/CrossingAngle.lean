# The model sector's crossing angle is its opening angle

`EpsilonEridani.Contour.crossingAngle` reads the opening angle at a crossing off the two one-sided
tangent limits, and `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_closedModelSector` gives the model sector of
opening `α` winding number `α / 2π` about its corner. Nothing connected the two: the winding
value was stated in terms of the *parameter* `α`, and the crossing angle in terms of *tangents*,
with no theorem saying they agree.

This file supplies that bridge. `crossingAngle_modelSector` holds for every real `α`: the
crossing angle at the corner is the `[0, 2π)` normalisation of `α`, which is `α` itself exactly
when `0 ≤ α < 2π`. Under those bounds,
`windingNumber_closedModelSector_eq_crossingAngle_div_two_pi` then restates the winding number
about the corner as the crossing angle over `2π`, with no reference to the parametrisation.

That is the shape a general curve can be compared against, since a curve is tangent to a model
sector without being equal to one.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.crossingAngle_modelSector`: the model sector of opening `α` has crossing
  angle `α` at its corner — stated for every real `α` as the `[0, 2π)` normalisation of `α`,
  which is `α` itself exactly when `0 ≤ α < 2π`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_closedModelSector_eq_crossingAngle_div_two_pi`: hence its
  winding number about the corner is `crossingAngle / (2π)`.

## References

* N. Hungerbühler, M. Wasem, *Non-integer valued winding numbers and a generalized Residue
  Theorem*, arXiv:1808.00997 — the model sector is their equation (2.4), and the crossing-angle
  reading of its index is what this file supplies.

tangent is `-exp((φ + α)i)` and the outgoing one is `exp(φ i)`, so the normalised angle from the
