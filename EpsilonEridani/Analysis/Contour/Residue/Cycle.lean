# The classical residue theorem for an arbitrary null-homologous cycle

For `f` differentiable on `U ∖ S` and meromorphic at each point of the finite set `S` lying in
`U`, and a **closed, null-homologous** piecewise-`C¹` curve `γ` in `U` that **avoids** `S`,

`∫ t in a..b, γ' t • f (γ t) = 2πi · ∑_{s ∈ S} n_s(γ) · Res_s f`,

where `n_s(γ)` is the generalized winding number of `γ` about `s`. This is the general
arbitrary-cycle form of the classical residue theorem, and it generalizes the circle theorem
(`Contour.classicalResidueTheorem_circle`): the contour is an arbitrary
piecewise-`C¹` loop rather than a round circle, and each pole is weighted by its winding number
rather than by `1`. Null-homology is not decoration — on a general holomorphy domain `Ω`, a loop
that merely avoids the poles need not integrate to the residue sum (a loop around a hole of `Ω`
sees the function's behaviour there), so `n_w(γ) = 0` for every `w ∉ Ω` is exactly the hypothesis
that rules this out. Its `S = ∅` case is the homology Cauchy theorem, which is why the roadmap
defers this statement past Layer 2.

The proof is the classical three-line argument, over the pieces the repository already has. The
polar-part decomposition (`Contour.PolarPartDecomposition.ofMeromorphic`) writes
`f = g + ∑_{s ∈ S} P_s` on `U ∖ S`, with `g` differentiable on all of `U` and `P_s` the finite
Laurent tail at `s`. The remainder `g` integrates to zero by the homology Cauchy theorem
(`Contour.PolarPartDecomposition.intervalIntegral_deriv_smul_analyticRemainder_eq_zero`). In each
Laurent tail the simple-pole coefficient integrates to `2πi · n_s(γ) · Res_s f`, by the very
definition of the winding number (the principal value collapses to an ordinary integral because
`γ` misses `s`), while every coefficient of order `≥ 2` integrates to zero around the closed
curve, having the primitive `−(k−1)⁻¹(z − s)^{−(k−1)}`
(`Contour.integral_pow_inv_mul_deriv_eq_zero_of_closed`).

Unlike the Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem
(`Contour.hungerbuhlerWasem_residueTheorem`), whose singularities may lie *on* the curve, nothing
here needs an immersion, a principal value, or the conditions (A′)/(B): with the poles off the
contour every integral in sight is an ordinary interval integral. Conversely this statement is
*not* a specialization of the HW theorem, which asks for the strictly stronger
`Contour.IsPwC1ImmersionOn` regularity, so a piecewise-`C¹` loop with a zero-speed seam is covered
here and not there.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.PolarPartDecomposition.intervalIntegral_deriv_smul_polarPart` — the contour
  integral of a polar part around such a curve is `2πi · n_s(γ) · Res_s f`.
* `PolarPartDecomposition.intervalIntegral_deriv_smul_eq_analyticRemainder_add_sum` — the residue
  sum splits off the contour integral without any null-homology hypothesis, the analytic
  remainder's integral being left standing.
* `PolarPartDecomposition.intervalIntegral_deriv_smul_eq_sum_windingNumber_mul_residue` — the
  residue theorem for a fixed decomposition, assuming nothing about `f` beyond it.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.classicalResidueTheorem_nullHomologous` — the residue theorem for an arbitrary
  null-homologous cycle avoiding the poles.

This is the "general arbitrary-cycle case" of the contour-integration roadmap, which that roadmap
defers to Layer 3+.

## Provenance

No formal source is vendored: the statement is assembled here from the repository's polar-part
decomposition, homology Cauchy theorem, and antiderivative lemma for higher-order Laurent terms,
which are themselves migrated from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` development.

/-- **Splitting the contour integral off the residue sum.** Once `f` is presented on `U` as an
analytic remainder plus finite Laurent tails at the points of `S`, a closed piecewise-`C¹` curve in
`U` avoiding `S` integrates to the remainder's integral plus the winding-weighted residue sum: the
tail at `s` contributes `2πi · n_s(γ) · Res_s f` by `intervalIntegral_deriv_smul_polarPart`.

No null-homology is assumed here, so the remainder's integral is left standing; discharging it is
what `intervalIntegral_deriv_smul_eq_sum_windingNumber_mul_residue` does for a null-homologous
curve. Keeping the two steps apart lets a cycle whose *generators* need not be null-homologous —
only the cycle as a whole — sum this identity over its support
(`EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.integral_eq_analyticRemainder_add_sum`).

Nothing is assumed about `f` beyond the decomposition itself: no differentiability or meromorphy
hypothesis appears, a decomposition already carrying everything the argument uses. When `decomp`
is obtained from `ofMeromorphic`, those hypotheses were consumed there. -/

/-- **The classical residue theorem for an arbitrary null-homologous cycle.** Let `U` be open,
`S` a finite set, `f` differentiable on `U ∖ S` and meromorphic at each point of `S` lying in `U`,
and let `γ` be a closed piecewise-`C¹` curve in `U`, **null-homologous** in `U`, that **avoids**
`S`. Then

`∫ t in a..b, γ' t • f (γ t) = 2πi · ∑_{s ∈ S} n_s(γ) · Res_s f`,

each pole weighted by the generalized winding number of `γ` about it.

Points of `S` outside `U` are harmless rather than excluded: null-homology forces their winding
number, hence their contribution, to vanish, so nothing at all is asked of `f` there —
meromorphicity is required only at the points of `S` that lie in `U`. Likewise `S` may list
regular points of `f`, whose residues are `0`.

Its `S = ∅` case is the homology Cauchy theorem (`Contour.homologyCauchyTheorem`), so this is
genuinely a Layer 3 statement; the round-circle case with the poles inside is
`Contour.classicalResidueTheorem_circle`, and the version admitting poles *on* the curve is the
Hungerbühler–Wasem theorem `Contour.hungerbuhlerWasem_residueTheorem`. -/
