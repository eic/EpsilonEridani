# Uniform distance from an avoided point to a continuous curve

For a curve `γ : ℝ → ℂ` continuous on a compact interval `[a, b]` and avoiding a point `w`, the
image `γ '' [a, b]` is compact and misses `w`, so `w` stays a positive distance from it; this gives
a uniform positive lower bound `ρ` on `‖γ t - w‖` over `[a, b]`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.exists_curve_dist_lower_bound` — the uniform positive distance lower bound.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.exists_ball_dist_curve_lower_bound` — the same lower bound made uniform over a
  whole ball of points around the avoided point.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.exists_mem_off_curve` — an open set containing a curve contains a point off the
  curve: the compact image cannot exhaust a nonempty open subset of the noncompact connected `ℂ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.isClosed_setOfPred_mem_uIcc_dist_le` and its norm spelling
  `EpsilonEridani.Contour.isClosed_setOfPred_mem_uIcc_norm_sub_le` — the parameters at which a curve stays
  within `ε` of a point form a closed set. Where the lemmas above give lower bounds on the distance
  to an avoided point, this one describes the near-point parameter set itself, which is what the
  excision arguments of the principal-value theory need.

These small support lemmas are shared by the argument-lift partition
(`exists_uniform_modulus_avoiding`, feeding the integer-valuedness of the winding number), by the
continuity of the winding number in the point (`continuousAt_windingNumber_of_avoidance`), and by
the homology form of Cauchy's theorem (`homologyCauchyTheorem`), whose Dixon-style proof picks its
base point off the curve via `exists_mem_off_curve`.

interval with endpoints `a`, `b` and maps it into an open set `Ω ⊆ ℂ`, then some `w₀ ∈ Ω` is not
on the curve. The image is compact, so if it exhausted `Ω` then `Ω` would be a nonempty clopen
subset of the connected `ℂ`, hence all of `ℂ` — which is not compact. This supplies the base point
off the curve that Dixon's proof of the homology Cauchy theorem requires. -/
