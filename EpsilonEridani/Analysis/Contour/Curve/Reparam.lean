# Reparametrization invariance of the contour integral

A contour integral `∫ t in a..b, deriv γ t • f (γ t)` is unchanged when the curve `γ` is
precomposed with a `C¹` change of parameter `φ`, the parameter interval `[[a, b]]` being replaced
by `[[φ a, φ b]]`. This file proves that invariance, together with the chain rule for the
reparametrized curve that it rests on.

The proof is the interval-integral change-of-variables formula
`intervalIntegral.integral_deriv_smul_comp'` applied to the contour integrand
`g u = deriv γ u • f (γ u)`, together with the chain rule
`deriv (γ ∘ φ) t = φ' t • deriv γ (φ t)`.

Three design points are worth flagging.

* Regularity is asked for as **ambient** pointwise derivatives, not `ContDiffOn`: `φ` satisfies
  `HasDerivAt φ (φ' t) t` at each `t ∈ [[a, b]]` and `γ` satisfies `DifferentiableAt ℝ γ` on the
  image, both two-sided in the ambient sense rather than merely within the set. This matches the
  global `deriv γ` of the roadmap's raw-function curve layer, which the chain rule identifying
  `deriv (γ ∘ φ)` needs pointwise. "`C¹`" in the docstrings below is shorthand for exactly this
  data.
* The regularity hypotheses are placed on the **image** `φ '' [[a, b]]`, not on `[[φ a, φ b]]`.
  This is the honest domain: `φ` is not assumed monotone, so the composite curve may sweep past the
  endpoints `φ a`, `φ b` and back. The intermediate value theorem
  (`intermediate_value_uIcc`) supplies `[[φ a, φ b]] ⊆ φ '' [[a, b]]`, so the hypotheses on the
  image also cover the reparametrized interval, and no monotonicity is needed anywhere.
* The curve `γ` is asked to be `C¹` with no breakpoints, one level above the piecewise-`C¹` class of
  the roadmap's curve layer. The piecewise case — split `[[a, b]]` at the preimages of the finitely
  many breakpoints and reassemble — is a separate increment, as is the on-curve principal-value
  case in the winding-number file.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.eqOn_deriv_comp_reparam` — the chain rule for a reparametrized curve on
  `[[a, b]]`, in the `deriv` form used by the contour integrand.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.continuousOn_deriv_comp_reparam` — continuity of `deriv (γ ∘ φ)` on `[[a, b]]`,
  the regularity every consumer of the reparametrized contour integrand needs for integrability.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.integral_deriv_smul_comp_reparam` — reparametrization invariance of the contour
  integral `∫ t in a..b, deriv γ t • f (γ t)`.

The winding-number consequences live in `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Contour/Winding/Number/Reparam.lean`.

## Provenance

This is routine API around the contour integrand of the contour integration roadmap; no formal
source is vendored. The change-of-variables input `intervalIntegral.integral_deriv_smul_comp'` is
Mathlib's.
