# The excised parameter set shrinks to nothing

An `ε`-excision deletes from the parameter interval every time at which the curve comes within
`ε` of one of finitely many centres. This file records that the deleted set carries no length in
the limit: the integral of the excision's indicator over `[a, b]` tends to `b - a` as `ε → 0⁺`.

Two properties of the curve are used, for two different parts of the argument. **Measurability**
makes each excised set measurable. **Nullity of the times the curve spends exactly
at a centre** gives the almost-everywhere convergence: away from those times the curve keeps a
positive distance from the finite centre set, so the excision condition eventually fails
outright. Injectivity on `[a, b]` is one convenient sufficient condition for the second — it
makes those times finite — and is recorded separately as
`measure_setOf_mem_eq_zero_of_injOn`; a curve may revisit centres, so long as it does so on a
null set of times.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.nullMeasurableSet_excision`: the excised parameter set is null-measurable
  against any measure for which the curve is a.e. measurable.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.measurableSet_excision`: its measurable specialization.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.measure_setOf_mem_eq_zero_of_injOn`: an injective curve meets a finite set at
  a null set of times.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.tendsto_intervalIntegral_excisionIndicator`: the excision indicator's integral
  over `[a, b]` tends to `b - a` as `ε → 0⁺`.

* [AINTLIB `LeanModularForms`](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB) — the valence-formula
  development. This file adapts the measure-theoretic step of
  `ForMathlib/ValenceFormula/PVChain/ArcContribution.lean`
  (`arc_non_excluded_measure_tendsto`, with its `arc_preimage_subsingleton` and
  `arc_min_dist_pos` helpers) onto the current Mathlib pin, restated for an arbitrary curve
  rather than the fundamental-domain arc.

sufficient condition for `tendsto_intervalIntegral_excisionIndicator`'s hypothesis. -/

/-- **The excised parameter set shrinks to nothing.** Deleting from `[a, b]` the times at which
the curve comes within `ε` of one of finitely many centres costs no length as `ε → 0⁺`: what
survives tends to the whole length `b - a`.

The curve must be measurable, and must spend only a null set of times exactly at a centre —
`measure_setOf_mem_eq_zero_of_injOn` supplies the latter from injectivity. -/
