# A decay bound for `∫ (γ - w)⁻¹ · g` when `w` is far from the curve

For a curve `γ : ℝ → ℂ` with `‖γ t‖ ≤ R` on the integrating interval and a point `w` with
`R < ‖w‖`, the integral `∫ t in a..b, (γ t - w)⁻¹ * g t` of an interval-integrable weight `g` is
bounded by `(∫ ‖g‖) / (‖w‖ - R)`: the distance lower bound `‖w‖ - R ≤ ‖γ t - w‖` gives
`‖(γ t - w)⁻¹‖ ≤ (‖w‖ - R)⁻¹` pointwise, so the estimate reduces to the `L¹` norm of `g`. This is
the common decay estimate behind the vanishing at infinity of both the generalized winding number
(weight `g = deriv γ`) and Dixon's `dixonH2` (weight `g = f (γ ·) * deriv γ`); using the `L¹` norm
rather than a uniform bound on `g` keeps it applicable to raw curves whose derivative is only
interval-integrable.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.norm_integral_inv_sub_mul_le` — the `(∫ ‖g‖) / (‖w‖ - R)` decay bound.

## Provenance

Factored from the far-field estimates in the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` development —
`contourIntegral_inv_norm_le_of_far` in `NullHomologous.lean` (the winding case, weight `deriv γ`)
and `dixonH2_norm_le` in `DixonTheorem.lean` (the Dixon case) — restated for a raw `γ : ℝ → ℂ` on an
oriented interval with an arbitrary interval-integrable weight `g`, and bounding by the `L¹` norm of
`g` rather than a Lipschitz or uniform bound.

/-- **Decay bound for a Cauchy-type integral far from the curve.** If `‖γ t‖ ≤ R` on `Ι a b`,
`g` is interval-integrable, and `R < ‖w‖`, then
`‖∫ t in a..b, (γ t - w)⁻¹ * g t‖ ≤ (∫ t in Ι a b, ‖g t‖) / (‖w‖ - R)`. The distance lower bound
`‖w‖ - R ≤ ‖γ t - w‖` makes `‖(γ t - w)⁻¹‖ ≤ (‖w‖ - R)⁻¹` pointwise, and the weight contributes its
`L¹` norm. Only the bound on the half-open interval `Ι a b` matters; the endpoints do not affect the
integral. -/
