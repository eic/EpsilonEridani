# The Cauchy principal value along a contour cycle

A contour cycle is a formal integer combination of closed piecewise-`C¹` curves, and every
additive invariant of curves extends to it by linearity. This file carries out that extension
for the set-level Cauchy principal value, the invariant the Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized
residue theorem evaluates when singularities of the integrand lie **on** the contour.

The direction of the definitions is opposite to the single-curve case, and deliberately so.
For one curve the predicate `EpsilonEridani.Contour.HasCauchyPV` comes first — it is a genuine
analytic statement about symmetric excision — and the value `EpsilonEridani.Contour.cauchyPV` is read
off it. For a cycle the **value** comes first: `Cycle.cauchyPV f` is the additive extension of
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.cauchyPV`, hence an `AddMonoidHom` by construction, exactly like
`Cycle.integral` and `Cycle.windingNumber`. The predicate `Cycle.HasCauchyPV` is then existence
along each curve of the canonical support together with that value. Defining the predicate
first, by simultaneously truncating all the generators, would not have produced an additive
value: a cancelling pair of generators would have to be seen to cancel truncation by
truncation, which no argument supplies before the limit is taken.

Nothing here identifies a principal value with an ordinary integral. Where the ordinary contour
integrand *is* interval-integrable along each generator, the two agree
(`Cycle.hasCauchyPV_integral`), which is the only bridge between them.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.cauchyPV` — the additive extension of the single-curve principal value.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.CauchyPVExists` — the principal value exists along every curve of the
  canonical support.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.HasCauchyPV` — existence, together with the value.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.cauchyPV_eq_sum_support` — the value as a coefficient-weighted sum.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.cauchyPVExists_iff` — existence along the canonical support.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.hasCauchyPV_iff` — the predicate as its two clauses.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.HasCauchyPV.of_generators` — a per-generator family of principal values
  assembles into the cycle's.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.HasCauchyPV.unique` — the value in the predicate is determined.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.hasCauchyPV_integral` — where the contour integrand is
  interval-integrable along each generator, the principal value is the ordinary cycle integral.

/-- `Cycle.HasCauchyPV` unfolded into its two clauses — existence along every curve of the

Deliberately not `@[simp]`: it unfolds the predicate, so it would take the left-hand sides of
`hasCauchyPV_of_iff`, `hasCauchyPV_zero` and `hasCauchyPV_neg_iff` out of simp-normal form.
Those three are the normal forms `simp` should reach for — on a generator, on `0`, and under
negation — and they carry the `@[simp]` annotation instead. -/
