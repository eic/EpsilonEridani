# The classical residue theorem for contour cycles

This file extends the classical residue theorem from one parametrized closed curve to a finite
formal integer cycle `C` of such curves. For `f` differentiable on `U ∖ S` and meromorphic at each
point of the finite set `S` lying in `U`, and a cycle `C` in `U` that is **null-homologous** there
and whose trace **avoids** `S`,

`Cycle.integral f C = 2πi · ∑_{s ∈ S} n_s(C) · Res_s f`,

each pole weighted by the generalized winding number of the cycle about it.

The extension is not a formal consequence of the single-curve theorem
(`EpsilonEridani.Contour.classicalResidueTheorem_nullHomologous`) applied generator by generator: null
homology is imposed on `C` alone, and its individual generators need not be null-homologous — the
whole point of allowing formal integer combinations is that a cycle can bound while its pieces do
not. What does split over the support is the *residue* half of the argument. So the proof runs one
rung lower down: a fixed polar-part decomposition `f = g + ∑_{s ∈ S} P_s` on `U` is chosen once,
and the null-homology-free identity

`∮_γ f = ∮_γ g + 2πi · ∑_{s ∈ S} n_s(γ) · Res_s f`

(`PolarPartDecomposition.intervalIntegral_deriv_smul_eq_analyticRemainder_add_sum`) is summed over
the generators of `C` with their coefficients. Only then is the analytic remainder `g` discharged,
by the homology Cauchy theorem for cycles
(`EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.homologyCauchyTheorem`), which does see the cancellations between
generators. Its `S = ∅` case is exactly that theorem.

Cauchy's integral formula for a cycle follows, as usual, by applying the residue theorem to the
Cauchy kernel `w ↦ f w / (w − z) ^ (k + 1)`, whose only singularity in `U` is at `z`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.integral_eq_analyticRemainder_add_sum` — the residue sum splits off the
  cycle integral for a fixed polar-part decomposition, before any null-homology hypothesis is used.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.classicalResidueTheorem_nullHomologous` — the residue theorem for a
  null-homologous cycle avoiding the poles.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.cauchyIntegralFormula_iteratedDeriv_nullHomologous`,
  `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.cauchyIntegralFormula_nullHomologous` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.cauchyIntegralFormula_deriv_nullHomologous` — Cauchy's integral formula
  for a cycle, for every iterated derivative and for `f` and `f'` themselves.

No formal source is vendored: the statements are assembled here from the repository's polar-part
decomposition and its homology Cauchy theorem for cycles, which are themselves migrated from the

/-- **The residue sum splits off a cycle integral.** For a fixed polar-part decomposition of `f` on
`U` at `S`, a cycle lying in `U` whose trace avoids `S` integrates to the integral of the analytic
remainder plus `2πi` times the winding-weighted residue sum.

Nothing is assumed here about `f` beyond the decomposition, and — crucially for the cycle case —
nothing about null-homology: the identity is summed from its single-curve form
(`EpsilonEridani.Contour.PolarPartDecomposition.intervalIntegral_deriv_smul_eq_analyticRemainder_add_sum`)
over the generators of the cycle, each of which may wind arbitrarily around the holes of `U`. -/

/-- **The classical residue theorem for a null-homologous contour cycle.** Let `U` be open, `S` a
finite set, `f` differentiable on `U ∖ S` and meromorphic at each point of `S` lying in `U`, and let
`C` be a contour cycle in `U`, **null-homologous** in `U`, whose trace **avoids** `S`. Then

`Cycle.integral f C = 2πi · ∑_{s ∈ S} n_s(C) · Res_s f`,

each pole weighted by the generalized winding number of `C` about it.

Null-homology is asked of the cycle only, never of its generators, so the theorem covers the
combinations that make cycles worth having: a difference of two loops around a hole of `U`, neither
of them null-homologous, is. Points of `S` outside `U` are harmless rather than excluded, their
winding number vanishing by null-homology, and `S` may list regular points of `f`, whose residues
are `0`.

Its `S = ∅` case is the homology Cauchy theorem for cycles
(`EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.homologyCauchyTheorem`), and its one-generator case is the single-curve
theorem `EpsilonEridani.Contour.classicalResidueTheorem_nullHomologous`. -/

/-- **Cauchy's integral formula for a cycle** (roadmap Layer 3). For `f` holomorphic on an open `U`,
`C` a contour cycle in `U` that is null-homologous there, and `z ∈ U` off the trace of `C`,

`Cycle.integral (fun w ↦ f w / (w − z)) C = 2πi · n_z(C) · f z`,

so that `f z · n_z(C) = (2πi)⁻¹ ∮_C f(w)/(w − z) dw`: the Cauchy-type integral over the cycle
recovers the value of `f` at `z`, counted with the multiplicity with which `C` winds around it. The
`S = ∅` companion of this statement is the homology Cauchy theorem for cycles
