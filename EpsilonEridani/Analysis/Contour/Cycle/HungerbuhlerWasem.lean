# The Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem for contour cycles

This file lifts HW Thm 3.3 from one parametrized closed curve to a finite formal integer cycle
`C` of them. For `f` holomorphic on `U ∖ S` and meromorphic at each point of the finite `S ⊆ U`,
and a cycle `C` in `U` that is **null-homologous** there, whose curves are piecewise-`C¹`
immersions rooted off `S` and satisfy the regularity conditions (A′) and (B),

`PV ∮_C f = 2πi · ∑_{s ∈ S} n_s(C) · Res_s f`,

each singularity weighted by the **generalized, non-integer** winding number of the cycle about
it — so the singularities may lie **on** `C`. This removes the first of the narrowings the
roadmap records for the pinned single-curve form
(`EpsilonEridani.Contour.hungerbuhlerWasem_residueTheorem`), which the paper states for a cycle.

Just as for the classical residue theorem for cycles
(`EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.classicalResidueTheorem_nullHomologous`), this is not the single-curve
theorem applied generator by generator. Null homology is asked of `C` alone: its generators may
each wind around the holes of `U`, and the point of allowing formal integer combinations is
precisely that a cycle can bound while its pieces do not. So the proof runs one rung lower down.
A polar-part decomposition `f = g + ∑_{s ∈ S} P_s` on `U` is fixed once, and the
null-homology-free splitting

`PV ∮_γ f = ∮_γ g + 2πi · ∑_{s ∈ S} n_s(γ) · Res_s f`

(`PolarPartDecomposition.hasCauchyPV_analyticRemainder_add_residue_sum_of_conditions`)
is summed over the generators with their coefficients — the principal value being additive over
a cycle by construction (`EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.cauchyPV`). Only then is the analytic remainder
`g` discharged, by the homology Cauchy theorem for cycles
(`EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.homologyCauchyTheorem`), which does see the cancellations between
generators.

The remaining narrowings of the single-curve form are inherited unchanged: `S` is finite, `f` is
`MeromorphicAt` at each of its points, and each generator is rooted off `S`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.hasCauchyPV_analyticRemainder_add_residue_sum` — the residue sum splits
  off the cycle's principal value, before any null-homology hypothesis is used.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.hungerbuhlerWasem_residueTheorem` — HW Thm 3.3 for a null-homologous
  cycle.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.hungerbuhlerWasem_residueTheorem_of_simple_poles` — the unconditional
  regime, conditions (A′) and (B) being automatic at worst-simple poles.

## Provenance

No formal source is vendored: the statements are assembled here from this repository's
single-curve Hungerbühler–Wasem theory and its homology Cauchy theorem for cycles, which are
themselves migrated from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` development.

/-- **The residue sum splits off a cycle's principal value.** For a fixed polar-part
decomposition of `f` on `U` at `S`, and a cycle in `U` whose curves are piecewise-`C¹`
immersions rooted off `S` and satisfying conditions (A′) and (B), the Cauchy principal value of
`f` along the cycle exists and is the ordinary cycle integral of the analytic remainder plus
`2πi` times the winding-weighted residue sum.

Nothing is assumed about null-homology, of the cycle or of its generators: the identity is
summed from its single-curve form
(`PolarPartDecomposition.hasCauchyPV_analyticRemainder_add_residue_sum_of_conditions`)
over the generators of the cycle, each of which may wind arbitrarily around the holes of `U`. -/

/-- **The Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem for a contour cycle** (HW Thm 3.3).
Let `U` be open, `S ⊆ U` finite, `f` holomorphic on `U ∖ S` and meromorphic at each point of
`S`, and let `C` be a contour cycle in `U`, **null-homologous** in `U`, whose curves are
piecewise-`C¹` immersions rooted off `S` and satisfy conditions (A′) and (B). Then the Cauchy
principal value of `f` along `C` exists and

`PV ∮_C f = 2πi · ∑_{s ∈ S} n_s(C) · Res_s f`,

each singularity weighted by the **generalized** winding number of `C` about it. The
singularities are allowed to lie **on** `C`, where those weights are in general not integers and
the contour integral only exists as a principal value.

Null-homology is asked of the cycle only, never of its generators, so the theorem covers the
combinations that make cycles worth having: a difference of two homologous loops around a hole of
`U`, neither of them null-homologous, is null-homologous. Its `S = ∅` case is the homology Cauchy
theorem for cycles
(`EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.homologyCauchyTheorem`), and its one-generator case is the single-curve
theorem `EpsilonEridani.Contour.hungerbuhlerWasem_residueTheorem`. Where the trace of `C` avoids `S`
the principal value is an ordinary integral and the statement is the classical residue theorem
for cycles (`EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.classicalResidueTheorem_nullHomologous`), which needs neither
immersions nor the conditions. -/

/-- **The generalized residue theorem for a contour cycle with simple poles** — HW Thm 3.3's
unconditional regime for cycles. When every prescribed singularity is at worst a simple pole,
conditions (A′) and (B) hold automatically along each curve of the cycle
(`EpsilonEridani.Contour.conditionAprime_of_simple_poles`,
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.conditionB_of_simple_poles`), leaving no regularity hypotheses beyond the
immersions. This is the form the argument principle consumes, a logarithmic derivative having
only simple poles. -/
