# The half-disc residue theorem

The Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem, run on the boundary of the upper half-disc of
radius `R` about the origin -- the contour of `WorkedExamples/HalfDisc/Basic.lean`, which passes
*through* the origin instead of detouring around it. With the winding numbers of
`WorkedExamples/HalfDisc/Winding.lean` -- `1` in the open upper half-disc, `½` at the origin, `0`
outside -- the principal value of `∮ f` along that contour is

`2π i · Σ_{s ∈ S} Res_s f + π i · Res₀ f`

for `f` holomorphic off `insert 0 S` with at worst simple poles there and `S` inside the half-disc:
each enclosed possible singularity contributes its full residue, while the possible singularity
*on* the contour contributes only half of its own. In the nonremovable simple-pole case at the
origin, the classical residue theorem cannot reach the second term at all, because the pole lies on
the path of integration and only a principal-value integral exists.

The `S = ∅` case, where the origin is the only prescribed point, is
`WorkedExamples/HalfDisc/HalfResidue.lean`; when `f` is regular at the origin, the result reduces to
the classical residue theorem for this contour.

The possible singularity on the real axis is pinned at the origin, as throughout the half-disc
development: the contour `halfDiscBoundary` is centred there, and a possible real singularity
elsewhere is reached by centring the contour on it instead. Every prescribed singularity is
required to be at worst simple, which is what makes the Hungerbühler–Wasem conditions (A′) and (B)
automatic.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.hasCauchyPV_halfDiscBoundary_of_simple_poles` — the principal value along the
  half-disc boundary, with possible enclosed singularities and a possible singularity at the
  origin on the contour.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.hasCauchyPV_halfDiscBoundary_diameter_of_simple_poles` — the same with the arc
  contribution subtracted off, leaving the principal value along the diameter and an explicit
  `circleMap` integral for the arc, the form Jordan's lemma bounds.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.hasCauchyPV_realSegment_of_simple_poles` — the same restated along the straight
  line `t ↦ t`, the form a real-axis improper integral consumes.

/-- **The half-disc residue theorem with enclosed possible singularities.** Let `f` be holomorphic
off the finite set `insert 0 S`, with at worst a simple singularity at each of its points, and let
every point of `S` lie in the open upper half-disc of radius `R`. Then the Cauchy principal value of
`∮ f` along the half-disc boundary is

`2π i · Σ_{s ∈ S} Res_s f + π i · Res₀ f`:

each enclosed possible singularity contributes its full residue, because the generalized winding
number there is `1`, while the possible singularity *on* the contour contributes only half of its
own. In the genuine simple-pole case, this is the half-residue contribution from the winding number
`½` at a smooth crossing. -/

/-- **The identity along the real segment.** The diameter of the half-disc traces the straight line
`t ↦ t`, so the principal value can be stated along that curve directly — the form a real-axis
improper integral consumes, with no reference to the auxiliary contour. Letting `R → ∞` with an
arc bound (Jordan's lemma, say) turns this into an improper-integral evaluation that the classical
residue theorem cannot reach when the origin is a genuine pole on the line of integration. -/
