# The winding numbers of the half-disc contour

`WorkedExamples/HalfDisc/Basic.lean` builds the boundary of the upper half-disc of radius `R`
about the origin and computes its generalized winding number at the one point of the contour that
the Hungerbühler–Wasem half-residue theorem needs: the origin, where the value is `½`. This file
computes the winding number at every point *off the contour*, which is what turns the contour
from the carrier of a single worked example into a general tool:

* `1` at every point of the **open upper half-disc**, the classical interior value, so a
  singularity there contributes its full residue;
* `0` below the real axis and outside the closed disc, so a singularity there contributes nothing.

The interior value is obtained with no homotopy or Jordan-curve input. Write `Λ` for the diameter
piece, `A` for the upper arc and `B` for the lower arc of the same circle. The full circle gives
`n(A) + n(B) = 1`, and `Λ` and `B` are evaluated by the *same* logarithmic FTC: about a point `s`
strictly above the real axis, neither `Λ t - s` nor `B θ - s` ever leaves the open lower
half-plane, hence never leaves `Complex.slitPlane`, so the principal branch of `Complex.log` is a
single-valued primitive along each and both integrals telescope to the same value
`log (R - s) - log (-R - s)`. Hence `n(Λ) + n(A) = n(B) + n(A) = 1`.

The vanishing statements go through `IsPiecewiseC1On.windingNumber_eq_zero_of_ray`: a point below
the axis escapes to infinity straight downwards, and a point outside the closed disc escapes
radially, in both cases without meeting the contour.

Together with `windingNumber_halfDiscBoundary`, this settles every point except those *on* the
contour other than the origin -- a real `t` with `|t| < R`, or a point of the upper semicircle.
There the winding number is a genuine principal value rather than an ordinary integral, and the
diameter's contribution is the principal value of a segment crossed away from its midpoint, which
the segment API does not yet evaluate.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_halfDiscBoundary_eq_one` — the winding number is `1` at every
  point of the open upper half-disc.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_halfDiscBoundary_eq_zero_of_im_neg` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_halfDiscBoundary_eq_zero_of_lt_norm` — it is `0` below the real
  axis and outside the closed disc.

/-! ### A logarithmic evaluation of an index integral -/

/-- **Slit-plane evaluation of an index integral.** If `γ` agrees on the open interval and at both
endpoints with a comparison curve `h` whose difference `h · - s` stays in `Complex.slitPlane`, the
index integral of `γ` about `s` telescopes through the principal branch of the logarithm.

The comparison shape is what makes this usable at a corner: the half-disc contour is not
differentiable at its junction, but it agrees with a smooth piece on each side of it. -/

/-! ### The interior value -/

/-- **The half-disc contour has winding number `1` about every point of the open upper half-disc.**

The diameter and the *lower* semicircle both telescope, through the principal logarithm, to
`log (R - s) - log (-R - s)`: about a point `s` above the real axis, neither `t - s` (for real `t`)
nor `B θ - s` (for `B` the lower semicircle) ever leaves the open lower half-plane, which is
contained in `Complex.slitPlane`. Since the whole circle has winding number `1`, the upper
semicircle contributes `1` minus the lower one, and the two occurrences of that common
logarithmic value cancel. -/
