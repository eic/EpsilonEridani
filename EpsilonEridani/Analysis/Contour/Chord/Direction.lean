# The direction of a chord at a point the curve passes through

Let `γ t₀ = z₀`, so the chord `γ t - z₀` vanishes at `t₀`. If the one-sided slope
`(γ t - γ t₀) / (t - t₀)` converges to a non-zero `L`, then although the chord shrinks to zero
its *direction* still converges: to the normalisation of `L` from the right, and to its negative
from the left.

The sign is the substance. Approaching from the left `t - t₀ < 0`, so the chord is a *negative*
multiple of the slope and points opposite to it. This is why the interior angle swept at a
crossing is measured from the outgoing tangent to the reversed incoming one, as
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.crossingAngle` does, and hence why a smooth crossing has angle `π` and
contributes `½` rather than `0`.

Both statements are exact rather than asymptotic: away from `t₀` the chord *is* a real multiple
of the slope (Mathlib's `sub_smul_slope`), so `NormedSpace.normalize_smul_of_pos` and
`normalize_smul_of_neg` give the identity pointwise, and the limits are the slope limits
transported.

Nothing here mentions curves, crossings or immersions, nor anything specific to `ℂ`: the
hypotheses are a point equality and a one-sided slope limit, so the results hold for any
`γ : ℝ → V` into a real normed space.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.tendsto_normalize_sub_nhdsGT` — the outgoing direction limit.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.tendsto_normalize_sub_nhdsLT` — the incoming direction limit, reversed.
