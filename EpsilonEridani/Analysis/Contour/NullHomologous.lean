# Basic API for null-homologous contours

The contour-integration roadmap uses `Contour.IsNullHomologous γ a b Ω` as the hypothesis that a
curve has zero generalized winding number about every point outside the domain `Ω`. This file
records the elementary set-theoretic API for that predicate: monotonicity in the ambient domain,
the universal and empty-domain boundary cases, intersections, unions, and replacement by another
curve with the same winding numbers off the domain.

These lemmas are prerequisites for the homology Cauchy theorem and for the Hungerbühler--Wasem
generalized residue theorem, where the same cycle is repeatedly viewed inside larger or smaller
domains and the proof only needs the vanishing of the winding number on the complement.

## Main results

* `Contour.IsNullHomologous.mono` — enlarge the ambient domain.
* `Contour.IsNullHomologous.inter`, `Contour.isNullHomologous_iInter` — combine null-homology
  hypotheses by intersecting domains.
* `Contour.IsNullHomologous.union_left`, `Contour.IsNullHomologous.union_right` — a null-homologous
  curve remains null-homologous after adjoining an extra part of the domain.
* `Contour.isNullHomologous_const`, `Contour.isNullHomologous_empty_iff`,
  `Contour.isNullHomologous_univ` — constant curves and the two boundary cases.
* `Contour.IsNullHomologous.refl`, `Contour.IsNullHomologous.of_eq` — a zero-length parameter
  interval is null-homologous in every ambient set.
* `Contour.IsNullHomologous.congr_windingNumber` — replace a curve by another with the same winding
  numbers outside the domain.

## Provenance

This is routine API around the Hungerbühler--Wasem null-homology condition from the contour
integration roadmap; no formal source is vendored.
