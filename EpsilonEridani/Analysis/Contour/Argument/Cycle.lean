# The argument principle for an arbitrary null-homologous cycle

For `f` whose zeros and poles *in* an open set `U` all lie in a finite set `S`, and a closed
piecewise-`C¹` curve `γ` that is **null-homologous** in `U` and avoids `S`,

`∫ t in a..b, γ' t • logDeriv f (γ t) = 2πi · ∑_{z ∈ S} n_z(γ) · ord z`,

where `n_z(γ)` is the generalized winding number of `γ` about `z` and `ord` is a caller-supplied
integer-valued function required to agree with `meromorphicOrderAt f` only at the points of `S`
that lie in `U` — positive at a zero, negative at a pole. Nothing is asked of `f` or of `ord` at a
point of `S` outside `U`: null-homology forces the winding number there to vanish, so its term
drops out whatever `ord` says. This is the arbitrary-cycle form of the argument principle: the
roadmap's Layer-2 statement `EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple` fixes the contour to be a round
circle with every special point strictly inside, so each order is counted exactly once; here the
contour is any piecewise-`C¹` loop and each order is counted with the multiplicity with which the
loop winds around it.

The proof is the classical one-liner over the two pieces the repository already has: the residue
theorem for a null-homologous cycle (`EpsilonEridani.Contour.classicalResidueTheorem_nullHomologous`)
applied to `logDeriv f`, whose residue at each point is the order of `f` there
(`EpsilonEridani.Contour.residue_logDeriv_eq_meromorphicOrderAt`). What has to be supplied is the input
regularity of `logDeriv f` rather than of `f`: on `U ∖ S` the logarithmic derivative is holomorphic
because `f` is analytic *and non-vanishing* there (a zero of `f` is a pole of `logDeriv f`, which
is exactly why the hypothesis asks `S` to collect the zeros as well as the poles), and at each
point of `S` lying in `U` it is meromorphic because `f` is.

Null-homology is load-bearing, as it already is for the residue theorem: on a domain with a hole
a loop that merely avoids the zeros and poles can still see the function's behaviour in the hole,
and `n_w(γ) = 0` for every `w ∉ U` is exactly the hypothesis that rules this out.

Unlike the circle statement, the hypotheses ask for genuine analyticity and non-vanishing of `f` at
every point of `U ∖ S`, so no pointwise "wrong value" there is tolerated. Nothing pointwise is
asked at the points of `S` lying in `U`, where only meromorphy is required, nor anywhere outside
`U`. The circle proof may instead replace `f` by its meromorphic normal form, because a circle
integral is unchanged by a change of integrand on a set codiscrete within the sphere
(`circleIntegral.circleIntegral_congr_codiscreteWithin`); no such congruence is available for a
general piecewise-`C¹` contour, and the null-homologous residue theorem used here asks for honest
differentiability of `logDeriv f` on `U ∖ S`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_nullHomologous` — the argument principle for a closed
  null-homologous piecewise-`C¹` cycle: `∮_γ f'/f = 2πi · ∑_{z ∈ S} n_z(γ) · ord z`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_nullHomologous_local` — the one-point case
  `∮_γ f'/f = 2πi · n_{z₀}(γ) · n`, the arbitrary-cycle counterpart of
  `EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_local`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_nullHomologous_of_analyticOnNhd` — the zero-counting
  specialisation: for `f` analytic on `U` whose zeros lie in a finite `S`,
  `∮_γ f'/f = 2πi · ∑_{z ∈ S} n_z(γ) · analyticOrderNatAt f z`, the winding-weighted count of the
  zeros of `f` with multiplicity.

This is the arbitrary-cycle upgrade of a Layer-2 target of the contour-integration roadmap; like
the residue theorem it rests on it, it is a Layer-3 statement, since its hypotheses and its proof
go through the homology Cauchy theorem.

## Provenance

No formal source is vendored: the statement is assembled here from the repository's residue
theorem for a null-homologous cycle and the local residue-form of the argument principle, which
are themselves migrated from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` development (where the residue
theorem is applied to `logDeriv f`).

/-- **The argument principle for an arbitrary null-homologous cycle.** Let `U` be open, `S` a
finite set collecting every zero and pole of `f` in `U`: `f` is analytic and non-vanishing at each
point of `U ∖ S`, and meromorphic of order `ord s` at each `s ∈ S` lying in `U`. Let `γ` be a
closed piecewise-`C¹` curve in `U`, **null-homologous** in `U`, that **avoids** `S`. Then the
contour integral of the logarithmic derivative counts the orders, each weighted by the winding
number of `γ` about it:

`∫ t in a..b, γ' t • logDeriv f (γ t) = 2πi · ∑_{z ∈ S} n_z(γ) · ord z`.

Since `ord` is positive at a zero and negative at a pole, this is `2πi` times the number of zeros
minus poles counted with multiplicity *and* with winding multiplicity — for a simple loop
enclosing them once, the classical zero-minus-pole count.

As in `EpsilonEridani.Contour.classicalResidueTheorem_nullHomologous`, points of `S` outside `U` are
harmless rather than excluded: null-homology forces their winding number, hence their
contribution, to vanish, so nothing is asked of `f` there. Likewise `S` may list regular
non-vanishing points of `f`, whose order is `0`.

The round-circle case, which asks nothing pointwise of `f` because it may pass to the meromorphic
normal form, is `EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple`. -/

/-- **The argument principle for a cycle around a single zero or pole.** If `z₀` is the only point
of an open `U` at which `f` fails to be analytic and non-vanishing, of order `n` there, and `γ` is a
closed piecewise-`C¹` curve in `U`, null-homologous in `U`, missing `z₀`, then

`∫ t in a..b, γ' t • logDeriv f (γ t) = 2πi · n_{z₀}(γ) · n`.

This is the `S = {z₀}` case of `EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_nullHomologous`, and the
arbitrary-cycle counterpart of `EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_local`: a loop winding `k` times
around a zero of order `n` integrates `f'/f` to `2πi · k · n`.

Membership `z₀ ∈ U` is not required, and nothing at all is asked of `f` at `z₀` unless it holds:
if `z₀` lies outside `U` then `f` is analytic and non-vanishing on all of `U`, and null-homology
makes `n_{z₀}(γ)` vanish, so both sides are `0` for any `n`. Accordingly the meromorphy and the
order hypotheses are conditional on `z₀ ∈ U`, exactly as they are in
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_nullHomologous`. -/

/-- **Winding-weighted zero counting.** Let `f` be analytic on an open `U` with all its zeros in a
finite set `S`, and let `γ` be a closed piecewise-`C¹` curve in `U`, null-homologous in `U`, along
which `f` does not vanish. Then

`∫ t in a..b, γ' t • logDeriv f (γ t) = 2πi · ∑_{z ∈ S} n_z(γ) · analyticOrderNatAt f z`:

the contour integral of `f'/f` counts the zeros of `f` with multiplicity, each weighted by the
winding number of `γ` about it. This is the pole-free specialisation of
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_nullHomologous`, with the orders read off by
`analyticOrderNatAt` instead of by a caller-supplied `ord`.

Only the *zeros* need be avoided, not all of `S`: `S` may list points where `f` does not vanish,
and `γ` is free to run through them, since `logDeriv f` is holomorphic there and their order — and
so their term in the sum — is `0`.

The zeros are automatically of finite order (`EpsilonEridani.analyticOrderAt_ne_top_of_zeros_subset`):
confining them to a finite set already rules out `f` vanishing identically near a point of `U`. -/
