# The argument principle against the divisor

`EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple` asks its caller for the data of the counting problem: a finite
set `S` collecting the nonzero-order points, an order function `ord`, and proofs that the two agree
and that `S` is exhaustive. Mathlib's `MeromorphicOn.divisor` already packages exactly that data —
`MeromorphicOn.divisor_apply` evaluates it to `(meromorphicOrderAt f z).untop₀`, and
`MeromorphicOn.divisor_ball_support_finite` supplies the finiteness from the same
`MeromorphicOn f (closedBall c R)` hypothesis the argument principle already assumes. This file
restates the argument principle against that API, so callers that already speak `divisor` need not
rebuild the finset and the order function by hand.

The only hypothesis this adds is `hsphere`: the bounding circle carries no zeros or poles. It does
double duty.

* It confines the nonzero-order points to the *open* disc, so a divisor taken over `ball c R` still
  accounts for every such point of `closedBall c R`.
* It rules out order `⊤`. This matters because `(⊤ : WithTop ℤ).untop₀ = 0`, so at a point where `f`
  vanishes identically the divisor reads `0` while the order does not, and the exhaustiveness
  obligation of `argumentPrinciple` would fail exactly there. No separate hypothesis is needed:
  `closedBall c R` is convex, hence preconnected, and the sphere is nonempty as `0 < R`, so
  `MeromorphicOn.meromorphicOrderAt_ne_top_of_isPreconnected` propagates the finite order at a
  boundary point to the whole disc.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_divisor` —
  `∮_{C(c,R)} logDeriv f = 2πi · ∑ᶠ z, divisor f (ball c R) z`, the argument principle with the
  counting data taken from `MeromorphicOn.divisor`. The conclusion uses the canonical finitely
  supported sum `∑ᶠ`, which is well defined because the divisor vanishes off `ball c R`; the
  finiteness witness `MeromorphicOn.divisor_ball_support_finite` stays inside the proof rather than
  appearing in the statement.

/-- Where a meromorphic function is analytic, its divisor records the order of vanishing. The
identity also holds at a point of infinite order, where both sides read `0`.

This is the bridge between `MeromorphicOn.divisor` — whose support is finite on a ball by
`MeromorphicOn.divisor_ball_support_finite` — and the `analyticOrderNatAt` vocabulary that zero
counts are stated in, so zero-counting arguments can reuse it instead of rebuilding the
correspondence. Note the finiteness is of the divisor's *support*, equivalently of the zeros of
finite order: a point where `f` vanishes identically has divisor value `0` and is absent from it. -/

/-- **The argument principle, against the divisor.** For `f` meromorphic on the closed disc
`C(c, R)` with no zero or pole on the bounding circle, the contour integral of the logarithmic
derivative is `2πi` times the sum of `MeromorphicOn.divisor` over the open disc.

This is `EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple` with the finite set and the order function supplied by
Mathlib's divisor API rather than by the caller. -/
