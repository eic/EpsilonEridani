# The Hungerbühler–Wasem crossing angle and regularity conditions (A′) and (B)

For a curve `γ : ℝ → ℂ` on `[a, b]` and an integrand `f : ℂ → ℂ`, this file defines the **crossing
angle** and the **flatness** of `γ` at a time, and the roadmap's two Hungerbühler–Wasem regularity
conditions at its on-curve singularities: the geometric flatness condition **(A′)** and the analytic
sector-cancellation condition **(B)**, the two regularity hypotheses of the generalized residue
theorem (HW Thm 3.3), evaluating the Cauchy principal value `PV ∮_γ f`. Condition (A′) asks that
at each prescribed singularity `s ∈ S` the curve `γ` be **flat of order equal to the order of `f`'s
pole there** — with a one-sided tangent line at a simple pole, hugged ever tighter at a higher-order
pole — and that it meet each `s` only finitely often. Condition (B) governs poles of order
`> 1`, coupling the Laurent principal part of `f` at each such pole with the entry/exit tangents of
`γ` there, via a sector-cancellation identity; simple poles need no sector condition.

## Main definitions

* `crossingAngle γ t₀` — the model-sector opening angle in `[0, 2π)`, from the exit tangent `L₊`
  to the reversed entry tangent `−L₋` (`mod 2π`), where `L₋`, `L₊` are the one-sided limits of
  `deriv γ` from the left and right at `t₀`. Junk when a one-sided tangent fails to exist; a smooth
  crossing gives `π` (`crossingAngle_eq_pi`). Meaningful at the corners/crossings of a
  piecewise-`C¹` curve.
* `basepointAngle γ a b` — the analogous opening angle at the join `γ a = γ b` of a closed curve,
  from the outgoing tangent at `a` to the reversed incoming tangent at `b`.
* `FlatOfOrder γ t₀ n` — `γ` is **flat of order `n`** at `t₀` (HW Def. 3.2): from each side the
  perpendicular distance from `γ t` to a one-sided tangent line at `γ t₀` is `o(‖γ t − γ t₀‖ⁿ)`.
  Order `1` gives a one-sided tangent line; larger `n` hugs the line more tightly.
* `FlatOfOrderBasepoint γ a b n` — the analogue at the join `γ a = γ b` of a closed curve, for the
  outgoing branch at `a` (from the right) and the incoming branch at `b` (from the left).
* `flatOfOrder_of_eventually_collinear` — a curve whose one-sided branches at `t₀` eventually stay
  on a line through `γ t₀` is flat there to **every** order; the two one-sided directions may
  differ, so a corner at `t₀` is allowed.
* `ConditionAprime γ a b f S` — HW condition (A′), a structure requiring `γ` to meet each `s ∈ S`
  finitely often (`finite_crossings`) and be flat of order `n` wherever `f` has a pole of order `n`
  there (`interior`, `basepoint`). Pole orders come from `f` via `meromorphicOrderAt`; `S` selects
  the singularities.
* `SectorCompatible f z₀ θ` — the one-crossing Hungerbühler–Wasem sector condition, a structure with
  fields `angle_rational` (`θ` is a rational multiple of `π`) and `laurent_compatible` (the Laurent
  principal part of `f` at `z₀` resonates with `θ`).
* `ConditionB γ a b f` — HW condition (B), a structure imposing `SectorCompatible` at every
  higher-order (order `> 1`) on-curve pole of `f`: at each interior crossing (`ConditionB.interior`)
  and at the basepoint (`ConditionB.basepoint`).
* `FlatOfOrder.of_le` / `FlatOfOrderBasepoint.of_le` and `pow_unit_tangent_eq_of_resonance` /
  `pow_unit_tangent_eq_of_basepoint_resonance` — the consuming bridges, at interior crossings
  and at the join: flatness restricts downward in the order, and the sector resonance
  `k · θ ∈ 2π · ℤ` at the crossing angle is the power equation of the unit tangent
  directions.
* `crossingAngle_eq_of_tendsto` / `basepointAngle_eq_of_tendsto` — the characteristic equations,
  evaluating each angle from one-sided `Tendsto` hypotheses on `deriv γ`. Downstream files cannot
  unfold the definitions (their bodies are not exposed), so these are the intended entry points.
* `coe_crossingAngle_eq_arg_neg_div_add_arg_div_sub_arg_div` — the crossing angle, read in
  `Real.Angle`, is exactly what the two boundary arguments of a crossing window carry beyond the
  argument swept between the window endpoints. This is the geometric identification the per-window
  principal value (`perWindow_truncated_integral_tendsto`) needs, and the `Real.Angle` form is the
  exact one:
  `Complex.arg` is additive only mod `2π`.

Both conditions read the on-curve pole orders of `f` from `meromorphicOrderAt`. Condition (B) needs
no explicit singular set — it fires **intrinsically** at the times `t₀` where
`meromorphicOrderAt f (γ t₀) < -1` (a pole of order `> 1`), so it is `S`-free. Condition (A′) is
imposed at the prescribed set `S` (selecting the singularities), with the required flatness order
taken from `f`. Both match the roadmap signatures and the way the residue theorem consumes them.

## Provenance

Migrated and adapted from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project (`angleAtCrossing`, `FlatOfOrder`,
and `SatisfiesConditionB`), specialised to the raw-function (`γ : ℝ → ℂ` on `[a, b]`) design of the
contour-integration roadmap. `FlatOfOrder` here uses HW Def. 3.2's tangent-*line* (orthogonal
projection) distance, so it is speed-independent at every order. Condition (A′) matches the flatness
order to `f`'s pole order at each `s ∈ S`; condition (B) detects the higher-order poles of
`f` intrinsically via `meromorphicOrderAt`.

/-- **Crossing angle** of `γ : ℝ → ℂ` at a time `t₀`, valued in `[0, 2π)`: the opening angle of the
model sector, from the exit tangent `L₊` to the reversed entry tangent `−L₋`, taken `mod 2π`. Here
`L₋ = lim_{t → t₀⁻} γ'(t)`, `L₊ = lim_{t → t₀⁺} γ'(t)` are the one-sided limits of `deriv γ`. This
is the orientation of Hungerbühler–Wasem's model sector-curve, whose arc of opening angle `α` runs
counterclockwise from the exit ray to the reversed entry ray and contributes `α / 2π`
(`indexIntegral_arc`). The normalization keeps it nonnegative: a **smooth** crossing
(`L₊ = L₋`) gives `π`, as in HW §3, and a cusp (`L₋ = -L₊`) gives `0`, the tangents alone not
distinguishing a degenerate sector from a full turn. As a `limUnder`-based value it is junk when a
one-sided tangent fails to exist; it is meaningful at the corners/crossings of a piecewise-`C¹`
curve. -/

`−L₋`, where `L₋ = lim_{t → b⁻} γ'(t)` and `L₊ = lim_{t → a⁺} γ'(t)`. This is `crossingAngle`'s
analogue at the basepoint, where the two tangents come from opposite ends of `[a, b]`; a smooth join

/-- **The crossing angle is what the boundary arguments carry beyond the endpoint sweep.** Fix
non-zero one-sided tangent limits `L_L`, `L_R` at `t₀` and non-zero `w_L`, `w_R`. Then the two
sum `arg (−L_L / w_L) + arg (w_R / L_R)` is the argument `arg (w_R / w_L)` swept from `w_L` to
`w_R`, plus exactly the crossing angle.

The intended reading takes `w_L = γ (t₀ − r) − s` and `w_R = γ (t₀ + r) − s` at the ends of a
crossing window, where the first two
arguments on the right are precisely the boundary arguments of the per-window principal value
(`perWindow_truncated_integral_tendsto`): the identity says that limit sees the crossing angle plus
a term depending only on the window endpoints. Nothing in the proof uses that reading, so `w_L` and
`w_R` are left free.

The equation is between `Real.Angle`s. That is not a weakening for convenience but the exact
statement: `Complex.arg` is additive only mod `2π`, and `crossingAngle` is itself a `toIcoMod`
normalization, so no `ℝ`-valued form is available without pinning a branch. -/

than `‖γ t − γ t₀‖ⁿ`. There are nonzero one-sided directions `v_plus` (right) and `v_minus` (left)
for which the component of `γ t − γ t₀` orthogonal to `v` — of length
`|((γ t − γ t₀) · conj v).im| / ‖v‖`, the distance from `γ t` to the line `γ t₀ + ℝ • v` — is
`o(‖γ t − γ t₀‖ⁿ)` as `t → t₀⁺`, symmetrically as `t → t₀⁻`. Order `1` is first-order tangency to a
line; larger `n` forces it to hug the line ever more tightly. Distance is measured to the tangent

/-- **Hungerbühler–Wasem condition (B)** for `f` along `γ` on `[a, b]`: at each higher-order
on-curve pole of `f` the crossing sector is `SectorCompatible`. Together with condition (A′)
it is a hypothesis of the generalized residue theorem (HW Thm 3.3), where it forces the
order-`> 1` principal parts to cancel, so that the `PV ∮_γ f` the theorem evaluates is
well-defined. Imposed at each *interior* crossing `t₀` strictly between the endpoints and at
the *basepoint* `γ (min a b)` (via `basepointAngle`), so a join singularity is not left free;
stated over `min`/`max`, the condition is invariant under swapping the endpoints
(`conditionB_comm`). Higher-order poles are found intrinsically via
`meromorphicOrderAt f (γ t₀) < -1`; simple poles need no sector
condition, so the predicate is `S`-free. -/

/-! ### Consuming the conditions

The two bridges from the conditions' data to the raw hypotheses the principal-value theorems
take: flatness restricts downward in the order, and the sector resonance `k · θ ∈ 2π · ℤ` at
the crossing angle is the power equation of the unit tangent directions. -/

/-- One-sided core of the downward restrictions: near `c` the chord is small, so on any
filter within `𝓝 c` an `o(‖γ · - γ c‖ ^ n)` bound is an `o(‖γ · - γ c‖ ^ m)` bound for
`m ≤ n`. -/
