# Piecewise `C¹` curves on an interval

The contour-integration roadmap states its objects — the generalized winding number, the contour
integral, and the Hungerbühler--Wasem regularity conditions — for a **piecewise `C¹`** curve
`γ : ℝ → ℂ` on the closed interval `[[a, b]]` between two parameters (in either order): continuous
there, and `C¹` on each piece between finitely many breakpoints. This file introduces
that regularity as a predicate `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On γ a b` on the raw function `γ` itself —
following the roadmap's function-based design, with no bundled path type — together with its API.

The predicate is the regularity a "regularity package" will use to *discharge* the integrand-level
hypotheses — continuity, pointwise differentiability, and integrability — that the raw
contour-integral lemmas take directly. Those lemmas do not consume the predicate themselves: the
fundamental theorem of calculus along a contour in `Contour.ArcFTC`, for instance, is stated on the
integrand so it works with any regularity package that supplies these hypotheses. The predicate is a
prerequisite for the homology Cauchy theorem and the generalized residue theorem.

## Main definitions

* `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On γ a b` — `γ` is continuous on `[[a, b]]` and `C¹` on every closed
  subinterval whose interior avoids a fixed finite breakpoint set in `(min a b, max a b)`.

## Main results

* `Contour.isPiecewiseC1On_iff` — unfold the predicate to its defining clauses.
* `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.continuousOn` — the underlying continuity on `[[a, b]]`.
* `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.of_contDiffOn` — a `C¹` curve is piecewise `C¹`, with no breakpoints.
* `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.of_breakpoints`, `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.exists_breakpoints` —
  introduce the predicate from, and eliminate it to, a finite breakpoint witness.
* `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.mono` — restrict the regularity to a subinterval `[[c, d]] ⊆ [[a, b]]`.
* `Contour.isPiecewiseC1On_comm`, `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.symm` — endpoint-swap invariance.
* `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.add`, `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.sub`,
  `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.const_smul` — the predicate is stable under the vector-space operations
  on curves, the two breakpoint sets being merged by union.
* `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.exists_finset_differentiableAt`,
  `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.exists_countable_differentiableAt` — differentiability off a finite
  (hence countable) set, in the exact shapes the raw contour-integral lemmas consume.
* `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.eventually_differentiableAt` (and its `_right`/`_left` one-sided
  corollaries) — eventual differentiability near an interior parameter.
* `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.intervalIntegrable_deriv` — the derivative is interval-integrable on
  `a..b`, glued across the breakpoints from the `C¹` pieces.
* `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.isBounded_image_deriv` — the derivative has bounded image on
  `[[a, b]]`, glued the same way.

## Provenance

Adapted from the regularity fields of the `PiecewiseC1PathOn` structure in the AINTLIB
`LeanModularForms` development, re-expressed as a predicate on a raw function `γ : ℝ → ℂ` per the
roadmap's function-based contour design rather than as a bundled path type. The piece-level
integrability of the derivative and its gluing across the breakpoints
(`IsPiecewiseC1On.intervalIntegrable_deriv`) follow `ClosedPwC1Curve.deriv_intervalIntegrable_piece`
and `ClosedPwC1Curve.deriv_extend_intervalIntegrable` in the same development's
`PaperPwC1Immersion.lean`, restated for the raw curve.

/-- **Piecewise `C¹` on the interval between `a` and `b`.** The curve `γ : ℝ → ℂ` is continuous on
the closed interval `[[a, b]]` (unordered, hence orientation-robust), and there is a finite set of
breakpoints `p ⊆ (min a b, max a b)` such that `γ` is `C¹` on every closed subinterval of `[[a, b]]`
whose interior avoids `p`. Equivalently `γ` is continuously differentiable on each piece between
consecutive breakpoints, with corners allowed only at the breakpoints; an unbounded-derivative cusp
such as `t ↦ √|t|` is excluded, being not `C¹` up to the breakpoint. This is the raw-function form
of the roadmap's piecewise-`C¹` curve — a `Prop` on `γ` itself, with no bundled path type. -/

/-- **Boundedness of the derivative of a piecewise-`C¹` curve on its whole parameter interval.**
Mirrors `IsPiecewiseC1On.intervalIntegrable_deriv`'s gluing-across-breakpoints argument, but for
boundedness of the image rather than interval-integrability. Orientation-generic like its
sibling: unlike `Icc a b`, which is empty (not `Icc b a`) when `b < a`, `uIcc a b` is symmetric
in `a` and `b`, so no `a ≤ b` hypothesis is needed. -/
