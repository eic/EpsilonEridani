# Cauchy–Goursat for a pole-free meromorphic function

If `A` is meromorphic on a closed disc `C(c, R)` (`R ≥ 0`) and has non-negative meromorphic order at
every point of the disc, then the contour integral of `A` around the boundary circle vanishes:
`∮_{C(c,R)} A = 0`.

This is the pole-free base case shared by the argument principle and the classical residue theorem:
integrating a meromorphic function with no poles inside the disc gives `0`. No pointwise regularity
of the raw function `A` is required — the statement is up to the meromorphic normal form of `A`,
which is genuinely analytic throughout the disc.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.circleIntegral_eq_zero_of_meromorphicOrderAt_nonneg` — the vanishing of the
  circle integral of a pole-free meromorphic function.

## Provenance

Adapted from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project, specialised to a circle and to the raw-function
design of the contour-integration roadmap.
