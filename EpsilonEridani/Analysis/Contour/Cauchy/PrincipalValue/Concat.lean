# Concatenating set-level Cauchy principal values

`HasCauchyPV` binds its finite excision set **existentially**, which is the right interface for
consumers but is too weak to concatenate: two principal values along adjacent subcurves may be
witnessed by *different* excision sets, and passing to their union changes the excised integrand.
Recovering the union form needs extra control that `HasCauchyPV` does not supply — the added
points being met on a null set of parameters is one sufficient condition, though not a necessary
one, since enlargement is also harmless wherever the integrand's contribution already vanishes.

This file therefore works with the prescribed-witness form `HasCauchyPVWith` of
`PrincipalValue/On.lean`, in which the excision set is an explicit parameter, and concatenates
there. Adjacent subcurves sharing one excision set
add (`HasCauchyPVWith.concat`), and the complementary piece can be subtracted off
(`HasCauchyPVWith.sub_right`) — the direction that splits a principal value along a closed contour
into its constituent arcs. Both are the set-level analogues of `HasCauchyPVAt.concat`, whose single
excised point is automatically shared.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.HasCauchyPVWith.concat` — principal values along `[a, b]` and `[b, c]` sharing
  an excision set add to the one along `[a, c]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.HasCauchyPVWith.sub_right` — the converse split: removing the `[b, c]` piece
  from the `[a, c]` principal value leaves the `[a, b]` one.

/-- **Concatenation.** Principal values along the adjacent subcurves `[a, b]` and `[b, c]` that
excise the *same* finite set add to the principal value along `[a, c]`. As for
`HasCauchyPVAt.concat`, the integrability of the excised integrand across `[a, c]` and the
additivity of the integral both follow from the two given principal values, so no ordering or
separate integrability hypothesis is needed. -/

/-- **Splitting off the far piece.** If the principal value along `[a, c]` and the one along
`[b, c]` excise the same finite set, then their difference is the principal value along `[a, b]`.
This is the direction that decomposes a contour: knowing the whole and one arc gives the rest. -/
