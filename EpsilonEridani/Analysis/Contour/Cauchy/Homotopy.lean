# Cauchy's theorem for null-homotopic contours

A closed piecewise-`C¹` path continuously homotopic to its constant path inside an open set is
null-homologous there. Consequently, the homology form of Cauchy's theorem makes the contour
integral of every holomorphic function vanish along such a path. This supplies the
null-homotopic special case explicitly requested in Layer 3 of the Contour Integration roadmap.

The homotopy is represented by Mathlib's `Path.Homotopy`; no differentiability of it is required.
The source path itself is assumed piecewise `C¹`, matching the raw-curve interface expected by
`homologyCauchyTheorem`.

## Main results

* `windingNumber_eq_zero_of_pathHomotopy_refl` — a piecewise-`C¹` loop continuously homotopic to
  its constant path through a point-avoiding homotopy has winding number zero about that point.
* `isNullHomologous_of_pathHomotopy_refl` — a piecewise-`C¹` loop continuously contracted inside
  `Ω` is null-homologous in `Ω`.
* `cauchyTheorem_of_pathHomotopy_refl` — Cauchy's theorem for such a contractible contour.

## Provenance

No formalization is vendored. The proof combines Tau Ceti's homotopy invariance of the winding
number with its homology Cauchy theorem. The implication “null-homotopic implies
null-homologous” and the resulting Cauchy theorem are standard; see S. Lang, *Complex Analysis*,
Chapter VI, and L. Ahlfors, *Complex Analysis*, Chapter 4, as cited by the Contour Integration
roadmap.

/-- **Null-homotopic implies null-homologous.** If a piecewise-`C¹` loop admits a continuous path
homotopy to its constant path whose image lies in `Ω`, then its generalized winding number vanishes
at every point outside `Ω`. Thus the loop is null-homologous in `Ω`.

This is one direction only: a null-homologous loop need not be null-homotopic. -/

/-- **Cauchy's theorem for a null-homotopic contour.** Let `p` be a piecewise-`C¹` loop admitting
a continuous path homotopy to its constant path inside an open set `Ω`. If `f` is holomorphic on
`Ω`, then the contour integral of `f` along `p` vanishes.

The path regularity is exactly what `homologyCauchyTheorem` expects; the homotopy supplies
containment of the source path in `Ω` and its null-homology there. -/
