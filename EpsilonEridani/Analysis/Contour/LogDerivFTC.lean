# Fundamental theorem of calculus for a logarithmic-derivative integrand

For a function `f : ℝ → ℂ` continuous on `[a, b]`, differentiable off a countable set `P`, and
staying in `Complex.slitPlane` on `[a, b]`, the principal `Complex.log ∘ f` is a single-valued
antiderivative of the logarithmic-derivative integrand `f' t / f t`, so

`∫ t in a..b, f' t / f t = Complex.log (f b) - Complex.log (f a)`.

Specializing to `f t = (γ t - w) / (γ a - w)` for a curve `γ` avoiding `w` gives the contour form
used downstream, `∫ t in a..b, γ' t / (γ t - w) = Complex.log ((γ b - w) / (γ a - w))`, where the
normalization by `γ a - w` is what keeps the ratio in the slit plane and makes the value at the
basepoint `a` equal to `Complex.log 1 = 0`. The exceptional set `P` accommodates the finitely many
breakpoints of a piecewise-`C¹` contour, and the oriented interval `[a, b]` needs no `a ≤ b`
assumption.

Specializing the other way, to `f = h ∘ γ` for a piecewise-`C¹` curve `γ` and an analytic `h`,
gives the curve form of the same principle: if `h` takes its values along `γ` in
`Complex.slitPlane`, then `Complex.log ∘ h ∘ γ` is a single-valued primitive of the
argument-principle integrand `deriv γ • (logDeriv h ∘ γ)`, so that integral is an endpoint
difference — in particular it vanishes on a closed curve. This is the corner-tolerant replacement
for `circleIntegral.integral_eq_zero_of_hasDerivWithinAt`, which needs a genuinely differentiable
contour.

That same integrand is what the winding number of the *image* curve computes: if `h` is moreover
zero-free along `γ`, then `h ∘ γ` misses the origin and its index integral
`(2πi)⁻¹ ∮_{h ∘ γ} dw / w` is, after the substitution `w = h z`, exactly
`(2πi)⁻¹ ∫_a^b γ' • (logDeriv h ∘ γ)`. Formally the substitution is the chain rule
`(h ∘ γ)' = γ' · h'(γ)`, available off the breakpoints of `γ` and so almost everywhere, which is all
an integral sees. This bridge is what turns every logarithmic-derivative integral identity — the
argument principle above all — into a statement about how often an image curve winds.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.analyticAt_logDeriv_of_analyticAt` — `logDeriv f` is analytic wherever `f` is
  analytic and nonzero; the regularity input shared by the results below and by the argument
  principle.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.intervalIntegrable_deriv_div_and_integral_deriv_div_eq_log_sub_log_of_im_nonneg`
  and `intervalIntegrable_deriv_div_and_integral_deriv_div_eq_log_neg_sub_log_neg_of_im_nonpos` —
  the boundary-tolerant comparison FTCs: the logarithmic integral of `g` is integrable and
  evaluates to an endpoint-log difference through a comparison `h` that is continuous on the
  closed interval, differentiable on the open one off a countable set, has integrable logarithmic
  integrand, is confined to a closed half-plane, is nonvanishing at the two endpoints and
  slit-plane-valued strictly between them, and agrees with `g` both on the open interval and at
  each endpoint — so endpoint values may sit on the negative-real boundary.
* `intervalIntegrable_deriv_div_and_integral_deriv_div_eq_log_sub_log_of_mem_slitPlane` (in
  `EpsilonEridani.Contour`, unqualified here only to stay inside the line limit)
  — the third member of that family, for a comparison confined to the slit plane on the whole
  closed interval rather than held off the cut by a half-plane condition. Its conclusion could be
  reached inline from `integral_deriv_div_eq_log_sub_log` plus `IntervalIntegrable.congr_uIoo` and
  `intervalIntegral.integral_congr_uIoo`, but that transport is performed at nine call sites
  across the winding developments, so it is factored here.
* the `_of_le` forms of the slit-plane and upper comparisons — the ordered-interval versions
  callers usually have: `a ≤ b`, hypotheses read on `Set.Icc a b` and `Set.Ioo a b` rather than
  through `min` and `max`, and integrability derived from a continuous derivative.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.integral_deriv_div_eq_log_sub_log` — the slit-plane logarithmic-derivative FTC in
  general `f' / f` form.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.integral_deriv_div_sub_eq_log` — its contour specialization to
  `f t = (γ t - w) / (γ a - w)`, the per-segment step for evaluating the winding-number integral as
  a sum of `Complex.log` argument increments.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.integral_inv_sub_mul_deriv_eq_log` — the `deriv γ` form with the winding-integral
  integrand `(γ t - w)⁻¹ * deriv γ t`, ready for the downstream winding sum.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.intervalIntegrable_deriv_smul_logDeriv` — interval-integrability of the
  argument-principle integrand `deriv γ • (logDeriv h ∘ γ)` along a piecewise-`C¹` curve.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.integral_deriv_smul_logDeriv_eq_zero_of_mem_slitPlane` — that integral vanishes
  along a closed piecewise-`C¹` curve on which `h` is analytic and slit-plane-valued.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_comp_eq_integral_logDeriv` — the bridge to the image curve: the
  winding number of `h ∘ γ` about the origin is `(2πi)⁻¹ ∫_a^b γ' • (logDeriv h ∘ γ)`.

## Provenance

Adapted from `segment_log_FTC` in `WindingInteger.lean` of the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms`
development, split from the argument-lift PR (#759) as an independent contour prerequisite.
The boundary-tolerant comparison forms port the corner FTC pieces of AINTLIB's
valence-formula winding-weight development
(`ForMathlib/ValenceFormula/WindingWeights/I.lean`, `Rho.lean`, `RhoPlusOne.lean`)
onto the current Mathlib pin.

analytic along a closed piecewise-`C¹` curve `γ` and takes its values there in
`Complex.slitPlane`, then `Complex.log ∘ h` is a primitive of `logDeriv h` along `γ`, so the
contour integral of `logDeriv h` vanishes.

This is the corner-tolerant replacement for `circleIntegral.integral_eq_zero_of_hasDerivWithinAt`:
`γ` need only be differentiable off the countably many breakpoints, which is what
`integral_deriv_div_eq_log_sub_log` asks for. Nothing is required of `h` off the curve — in the
Rouché application `h = g / f` has both zeros and poles inside. -/

/-- **The winding number of the image curve is the logarithmic-derivative integral.** If `h` is
analytic and zero-free along a piecewise-`C¹` curve `γ`, the composite `h ∘ γ` avoids the origin
and

`n_0(h ∘ γ) = (2πi)⁻¹ ∫_a^b γ' t · (logDeriv h) (γ t)`.

This is the substitution `w = h z` in the index integral `(2πi)⁻¹ ∮_{h ∘ γ} dw / w`, carried out by
the chain rule. The chain rule is available only off the breakpoints of `γ`, a finite set, so the
two integrands agree merely almost everywhere — enough for both the integrals and the
interval-integrability to transfer. No regularity of `h ∘ γ` beyond continuity and this
almost-everywhere derivative is needed, so nothing has to be said about `h ∘ γ` being
piecewise `C¹` (it is, but `windingNumber` does not ask).

The analyticity hypothesis is local: `AnalyticAt ℂ h (γ t)` asks only for *some* neighbourhood of
each point of the curve on which `h` is analytic, never for one ambient open set carrying the whole
curve, and imposes no condition beyond those neighbourhoods. So the lemma applies verbatim to a
function with zeros and poles inside the region the curve encloses; that is what the argument
principle then counts. -/

/-- **The comparison logarithmic FTC on the slit plane**: for a comparison function `h` that
stays in the slit plane on the whole oriented closed interval — endpoints included — is
continuous there, is differentiable strictly inside off a countable exceptional set `P`, and
has interval-integrable logarithmic derivative, and for a `g` agreeing with `h` on the open
interval and at both endpoints, the logarithmic integral of `g` is integrable and evaluates
to the difference of its endpoint logarithms.

Integrability of `deriv h / h` is assumed rather than derived: callers that have a continuous
derivative and nonvanishing `h` get it from `ContinuousOn.div` plus
`ContinuousOn.intervalIntegrable`.

This is the sibling of the two half-plane forms above: there the comparison may touch the
branch cut at an endpoint and is held off it by a half-plane condition, whereas here it is
slit-plane-valued throughout and no half-plane hypothesis is needed. -/

/-- **The comparison logarithmic FTC on the slit plane, ordered-interval form.** The form
callers actually have to hand: an oriented interval `a ≤ b`, a comparison function `h`
continuous with continuous derivative on `Icc a b`, slit-plane-valued there and
differentiable strictly inside, and a `g` agreeing with `h` on `Ioo a b` and at both
endpoints.

Integrability of `deriv h / h` is derived rather than assumed — slit-plane confinement
already forces `h` to be nonvanishing — and the interval hypotheses read on `Set.Icc a b`
and `Set.Ioo a b` instead of through `min` and `max`. Everything else is
`intervalIntegrable_deriv_div_and_integral_deriv_div_eq_log_sub_log_of_mem_slitPlane`, which
remains the general statement to reach for when the interval is unoriented, the
exceptional set is nonempty, or integrability comes from somewhere other than a continuous
derivative. -/

/-- **The boundary-tolerant logarithmic FTC on an ordered interval, upper form.** The form
callers usually have: an oriented interval `a ≤ b`, a comparison function `h` continuous with
