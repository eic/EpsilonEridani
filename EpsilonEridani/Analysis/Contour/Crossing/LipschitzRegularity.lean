# The `C^{1,1}` crossing-regularity hypothesis

This file defines `HasLipschitzDerivOnEachSideAt`, the one-sided-Lipschitz-derivative regularity
condition a crossing needs for the real winding integrand to stay bounded there
(`Winding.RealIntegral.OnCurve`), and its introduction/elimination API. The predicate itself
is integrand-independent -- purely a statement about `derivWithin γ` on each side of `t` -- so it
is kept separate from the integrand-specific boundedness result it feeds.

## Main results

* `Contour.HasLipschitzDerivOnEachSideAt` -- `derivWithin γ` is Lipschitz on a one-sided closed
  window ending or starting at `t`, on each side (a `KR`/`εR`-window to the right, a `KL`/`εL`-
  window to the left) -- the two sides need not agree, so `t` may coincide with a breakpoint of
  the immersion.
* `Contour.hasLipschitzDerivOnEachSideAt_iff` -- its characteristic elimination/introduction iff.
* `Contour.hasLipschitzDerivOnEachSideAt_of_lipschitzOnWith` -- introduces it from one-sided
  `C^{1,1}` data on arbitrary pieces.
* `Contour.hasLipschitzDerivOnEachSideAt_of_contDiffOn` -- introduces it from one-sided `C²` data.

/-- **The `C^{1,1}` crossing-regularity hypothesis**: `derivWithin γ` is Lipschitz on a one-sided
closed window ending or starting at `t`, on each side (a `KR`/`εR`-window to the right, a
`KL`/`εL`-window to the left) — the two sides need not agree, so `t` may coincide with a
breakpoint of the immersion. Packages the hypotheses of `Winding.LipschitzBoundedIntegrand`'s
`exists_isBounded_image_realWindingIntegrand_of_lipschitzOnWith_derivWithin_corner` other than
differentiability and each side's non-vanishing velocity, which a caller who already
has a piecewise-`C¹` immersion in hand gets for free from
`IsPwC1ImmersionOn.exists_lipschitzOnWith_derivWithin_shrink_right`/`_left` (differentiability)
and `IsPwC1ImmersionOn.derivWithin_ne_zero_right`/`_left` (non-vanishing velocity), so should not
need to separately supply either. An opaque `def`, not an `abbrev`: consumers destructure it via
`hasLipschitzDerivOnEachSideAt_iff` below rather than unfolding it directly. -/

  ∃ εR > 0, ∃ KR : ℝ≥0, LipschitzOnWith KR (derivWithin γ (Icc t (t + εR))) (Icc t (t + εR)) ∧
    ∃ εL > 0, ∃ KL : ℝ≥0,
    LipschitzOnWith KL (derivWithin γ (Icc (t - εL) t)) (Icc (t - εL) t)

/-- **The characteristic iff for `HasLipschitzDerivOnEachSideAt`.** Equates the opaque `def` above
with its displayed one-sided witness proposition, exposing the `εR`/`KR`-window to the right and
the `εL`/`KL`-window to the left as a plain nested existential -- the introduction/elimination
interface a caller (e.g. via `choose!`) uses to name the witnesses, or to build the predicate from
them directly, rather than unfolding the `def`. -/

/-- **Introducing `HasLipschitzDerivOnEachSideAt` from one-sided `C^{1,1}` data on arbitrary
pieces.** If `derivWithin γ` is Lipschitz on `[c, t]` and on `[t, d]`, `t` itself has a Lipschitz
derivative on each side -- the defining `εR`/`εL`-windows are just these same pieces, `εR := d - t`
and `εL := t - c`. A caller whose one-sided pieces are wider than it ultimately needs must
transfer `derivWithin` to the narrower piece first (e.g. via
`IsPwC1ImmersionOn.exists_lipschitzOnWith_derivWithin_shrink_right`/`_left`):
`LipschitzOnWith.mono`
alone does not suffice, since `derivWithin` itself depends on the underlying set. -/

/-- **Introducing `HasLipschitzDerivOnEachSideAt` from one-sided `C²` data.** A `γ` twice
differentiable on `[c, t]` and on `[t, d]` -- independently, so `t` may be a corner where the two
sides disagree -- has, on each half, a `C¹` (hence locally Lipschitz, and Lipschitz on the
compact half itself) `derivWithin`: the natural route to `HasLipschitzDerivOnEachSideAt` for a
curve with an honest second derivative on each side of a crossing, as opposed to the merely
`C^{1,1}` case this predicate was built to also cover. The two-sided `C²` case is `hγ.mono` on
each half at the call site. -/
