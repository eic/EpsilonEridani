# Excising a crossing window and capping it with a circular arc

Hungerbühler–Wasem Proposition 2.2 decomposes a closed piecewise-`C¹` immersion `Λ` that meets a
point `s` finitely often as `Λ = \tilde{\Lambda} + Γ₁ + ⋯ + Γₙ`, where `\tilde{\Lambda}` avoids `s`
and each `Γ_ℓ` is a local loop at a crossing, and concludes
`n_s(Λ) = n_s(\tilde{\Lambda}) + ∑_ℓ α_ℓ / 2π`. The identity *modulo an integer* is
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.IsPwC1ImmersionOn.exists_int_windingNumber_eq_add_sum_crossingAngle`, whose
integer is produced abstractly because the surgered curve `\tilde{\Lambda}` is never built. This
file builds it.

The surgery is the obvious one. A parameter window `[l, u]` containing the crossing is chosen so
that the curve sits on the circle `|z - s| = |r|` at both ends, `γ l = circleMap s r θ` and
`γ u = circleMap s r θ'`. The window is then deleted and replaced by the arc of that circle running
from angle `θ` to angle `θ'` (`EpsilonEridani.Contour.circleCap`), giving `exciseCrossing γ s r l u θ θ'`,
a curve that agrees with `γ` outside the window. Each further property it has comes with its own
hypotheses:

* it is again piecewise `C¹` on `[a, b]` (`IsPiecewiseC1On.exciseCrossing`) provided `γ` is and the
  window sits strictly inside with `a < l < u < b`, the two endpoint conditions being what glues the
  cap to `γ`;
* it is again closed (`exciseCrossing_closed`) provided `γ a = γ b` and the window misses the two
  endpoints, `a < l` and `u < b`;
* and — this is the point — it **avoids `s`** (`exciseCrossing_ne_center`) provided the signed
  radial scale is nonzero, `r ≠ 0`, and `γ` itself meets `s` only strictly inside the window.

Under all of these together its winding number about `s` is an integer.

`Crossing.Decomposition` builds on this surgery to prove the exact finite-window winding-number
accounting identity and its one-window specialization.

What remains of HW Proposition 2.2 is the identification of the local contribution with the crossing
angle `α_ℓ / 2π` for a general immersion. It is congruent to `α_ℓ / 2π` modulo `1` — that is exactly
the content of the modulo-an-integer theorem cited above — and the outstanding step is the estimate
that pins the representative, namely that the local loop over a small enough window winds less than
once.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.circleCap` — for a nondegenerate window `l ≠ u`, the arc with signed radial scale
  `r` about `s` sweeping from angle `θ` to angle `θ'`, parametrised affinely over `[l, u]`; when
  `l = u` the affine change of parameter degenerates and the arc is constantly `circleMap s r θ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.exciseCrossing` — the curve `γ` with the window `[l, u]` replaced by that cap.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_circleCap` — the cap has winding number `(θ' - θ) / 2π` about `s`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.exciseCrossing` — the excised curve is piecewise `C¹`,
  `EpsilonEridani.Contour.exciseCrossing_closed` — it is closed if `γ` is, and
  `EpsilonEridani.Contour.exciseCrossing_ne_center` — it avoids `s`.

## Provenance

Independently reconstructed; no formalization is vendored. The `ContourIntegration` roadmap
designates the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` development
([github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB), Apache-2.0) as the existing
source for this area, and assigns `LeanModularForms/ForMathlib/HungerbuhlerWasem/Crossing.lean` to
"Prop 2.2 / sector geometry". That file was consulted and carries no excise-and-cap construction:
at revision `340875a` it is the per-pole principal-value composition (`HasCauchyPV.add`,
`HasCauchyPV.finset_sum`, `cpv_polarPart_at_pole_under_conditions`) together with the crossing
angle-compatibility lemmas, and the surgered curve `\tilde{Λ}` is never built there either. The
one place AINTLIB names this excision, `ForMathlib/ExitTime.lean`, constructs only the exit-time
parameters bounding the window (`firstExitTimeLeft`, `firstExitTimeRight`), not the spliced curve.
So the definitions and proofs below are new, assembled from Tau Ceti's existing winding-number API
for reparametrisation and circles.

/-! ### The circular cap -/

/-- **The circular cap** with signed radial scale `r` about `s`: the arc of the circle
`|z - s| = |r|` parametrised affinely over the window `[l, u]`, running from angle `θ` at `l`
(`circleCap_left`) to angle `θ'` at `u` (`circleCap_right`) whenever the window is nondegenerate,
`l ≠ u`. For `l = u` the affine
change of parameter divides by zero, so the cap is constantly `circleMap s r θ` and does not reach
angle `θ'`; every result below that needs the far endpoint assumes `l < u` or `l ≠ u`.

It is written as `circleMap s r` precomposed with an affine change of parameter, which is the shape
the reparametrisation and principal-value lemmas for circular arcs consume. -/

/-! ### The excised curve -/

/-- **The excised curve**: `γ` with the parameter window `[l, u]` deleted and replaced by the
circular cap with signed radial scale `r` about `s` running from angle `θ` to angle `θ'`. This is
the curve HW Proposition 2.2 calls `\tilde{\Lambda}`.

The definition itself assumes nothing; the properties that make it a surgery each need hypotheses.
If `γ` is continuous (indeed piecewise `C¹`) on `[a, b]`, the window is nondegenerate and strictly
inside, `a < l < u < b`, and the two endpoint conditions `γ l = circleMap s r θ` and
`γ u = circleMap s r θ'` hold, then the replacement glues continuously and the result is again
piecewise `C¹` (`IsPiecewiseC1On.exciseCrossing`). If moreover `γ a = γ b` it is again closed
(`exciseCrossing_closed`). And if the signed radial scale is nonzero, `r ≠ 0`, and `γ` meets `s`
only inside the open window, then the excised curve misses `s` altogether
(`exciseCrossing_ne_center`). -/
