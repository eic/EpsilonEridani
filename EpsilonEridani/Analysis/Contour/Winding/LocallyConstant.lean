# The winding number is locally constant off a closed curve

For a closed curve `γ` (so `γ a = γ b`) that is continuous on `Set.uIcc a b`, differentiable off a
countable set, with interval-integrable derivative, the generalized winding number
`fun w ↦ windingNumber γ a b w`, viewed as a function on the points off the curve, is locally
constant (`isLocallyConstant_windingNumber_of_closed`). It is the ingredient Dixon's argument uses
for the homology form of Cauchy's theorem (roadmap `homologyCauchyTheorem`). As a corollary,
the winding number is constant on every connected component of the curve complement. Also,
`exists_ball_windingNumber_zero` packages the local matching data Dixon needs: around an off-curve
point where the winding number vanishes, it vanishes on a whole ball that stays off the curve.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.isLocallyConstant_windingNumber_of_closed` — the winding number is locally
  constant on the complement of a closed curve.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_eq_of_mem_connectedComponentIn` — the winding number is constant
  on each connected component of the curve complement.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.windingNumber_eq_of_mem_connectedComponentIn` — the direct
  piecewise-`C¹` form.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.exists_ball_windingNumber_zero` — around an off-curve point where the winding
  number vanishes, it vanishes on a whole ball that stays off the curve.

## Provenance

Adapted from `generalizedWindingNumber_locally_const_of_closed` in `WindingArgDiff.lean` of the
AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` development, restated for a raw `γ : ℝ → ℂ` on an oriented interval with
endpoints `a` and `b`.

For a closed curve that is continuous on `[[a, b]]`, differentiable away from a countable set,
and has interval-integrable derivative, two points in the same connected component of

This is the connected-component form of homotopy invariance in the point: it follows from local
constancy of the integer-valued winding number off the curve. -/

/-- **The winding number vanishes on a ball around an off-curve null point.** For a closed curve
`γ` (differentiable off a countable set, continuous on `uIcc a b`, with interval-integrable

ball around `w` that stays off the curve. This is the local matching input for Dixon's argument: the
off-curve set is open, so the subtype-open set on which local constancy pins the winding number to
`0` pushes forward, along the open inclusion `Subtype.val`, to a `ℂ`-ball. -/
