# Boundedness of the real winding integrand at `C^{1,1}` crossings

`Winding/BoundedIntegrand.lean` proves the real winding integrand stays bounded near a crossing
where the curve is `C²`. This file weakens that regularity to merely `C^{1,1}` on each side of the
crossing: `derivWithin γ (Icc c d)` Lipschitz on a one-sided closed piece `[c, d]` ending or
starting at the crossing, with no second derivative -- pointwise or almost everywhere -- assumed
to exist anywhere, and no assumption that the two sides agree. This covers a crossing that
coincides with a breakpoint of a piecewise-`C¹` immersion (a corner, where the two one-sided
tangents may differ), not just a crossing where `γ` is genuinely differentiable on a full
two-sided neighborhood. This is a genuinely different proof technique from the `C²` case, not a
weakening of it: the `C²` proof reads the bounded limit off an explicit curvature value at the
crossing (which needs a second derivative there); this file instead bounds the integrand directly
from the quadratic remainder a Lipschitz derivative forces on the curve itself, via the mean value
inequality applied to the affine remainder on the segment from the crossing to each nearby
parameter -- entirely on one side at a time, so the two sides never need to interact. Only plain
differentiability of `γ` is assumed (not continuity of its derivative): Lipschitz-ness of
`derivWithin γ (Icc c d)` already gives that for free.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.exists_isBounded_image_realWindingIntegrand_of_lipschitzOnWith_derivWithin_right`
  and `..._left` -- the real winding integrand is bounded on a small enough one-sided window,
  starting (resp. ending) at a crossing where `derivWithin γ` is Lipschitz and non-zero there, on
  the one-sided piece the window lies in.
* `..._corner` -- the two one-sided windows above combined into one full neighborhood of the
  crossing, allowing the two sides to disagree.

/-- **Boundedness of the real winding integrand at a `C^{1,1}` crossing, from the right.** If `γ`
is differentiable on `[t₀, d]` and `derivWithin γ (Icc t₀ d)` is `K`-Lipschitz there and non-zero
at `t₀`, where `γ t₀ = w`, then the real winding integrand (the ordinary derivative, which agrees
with the within-piece one strictly inside `[t₀, d]`) is bounded on a small enough right-window
`[t₀, t₀ + ρ]` -- no second derivative, pointwise or almost everywhere, is assumed to exist
anywhere, and no assumption is made about `γ` to the left of `t₀`. At `t₀` itself `deriv γ t₀` may
take any junk value (it need not equal the one-sided `derivWithin`): the integrand there is
`realWindingIntegrand 0 _`, independent of the velocity argument, so the junk value is harmless.
This is the corner case of `Winding/BoundedIntegrand.lean`'s smooth-crossing result: `t₀` may

this one. -/

/-- **Boundedness of the real winding integrand on the full neighborhood of a `C^{1,1}` corner
crossing.** Combines `_right` and `_left` above into the full two-sided window `[t₀ - ρ, t₀ + ρ]`,
allowing the two sides to have genuinely different pieces and Lipschitz constants, as at a
corner where the one-sided tangents themselves may differ. -/
