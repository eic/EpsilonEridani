# Scaling invariance for contour winding numbers

This file records the basic nonzero-scaling API for the generalized winding number. Multiplying
both the curve and the distinguished point by the same nonzero complex number leaves the index
principal value unchanged, so the winding number and null-homology are invariant. Scaling only
reindexes the excision radius by the order-isomorphism `ε ↦ ε / ‖c‖`, so no principal-value
existence hypothesis is needed.

These lemmas are bookkeeping for the roadmap's curve and cycle layer. The geometry of the
generalized winding number is local at a crossing or sector; after translating the crossing point
to the origin, finite-decomposition arguments also rescale the local model before applying the
sector computation.

## Main results

* `Contour.hasCauchyPVAt_inv_sub_const_mul` /
  `Contour.cauchyPVExistsAt_inv_sub_const_mul` — the index principal value transports under
  nonzero scaling of the curve and base point; these are exposed so downstream normalization steps
  can obtain the scaled `HasCauchyPVAt` / `CauchyPVExistsAt` fact and chain further
  principal-value APIs.
* `Contour.windingNumber_const_mul` — multiplying the curve and base point by the same nonzero
  complex number preserves the generalized winding number.
* `Contour.IsNullHomologous.const_mul` — null-homology is preserved by nonzero complex scaling of
  both the curve and the ambient set.

## Provenance

This is routine API around the Hungerbühler--Wasem generalized winding number from the contour
integration roadmap; no formal source is vendored.

general `HasCauchyPVAt.const_mul_curve` to the winding kernel, where the rescaled integrand
`z ↦ c⁻¹ * κ[z₀] (c⁻¹ * z)` agrees with `κ[c * z₀]` along the scaled curve. Exposed so downstream
