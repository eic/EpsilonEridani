# Orientation reversal for contour winding numbers

This file records the basic orientation-reversal API for the generalized winding number.
Reversing the interval orientation negates the single-point Cauchy principal value defining
`Contour.windingNumber`, so the winding number itself changes sign.

These lemmas are bookkeeping for the roadmap's curve and cycle layer. Cycles are oriented formal
combinations of curves, and finite decompositions of curves into avoiding pieces and model sectors
need both concatenation and orientation reversal.

## Main results

* `Contour.windingNumber_symm` — the generalized winding number changes sign when the interval is
  reversed.
* `Contour.IsNullHomologous.symm`, `Contour.IsNullHomologous.symm_of_avoidance` — null-homology is
  preserved by reversing orientation, under the same honest principal-value existence hypotheses
  used elsewhere in the winding-number API.

## Provenance

This is routine API around the Hungerbühler--Wasem generalized winding number from the contour
integration roadmap; no formal source is vendored.
