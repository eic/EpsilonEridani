# Translation invariance for contour winding numbers

This file records the basic translation-invariance API for the generalized winding number.
Translating both the curve and the distinguished point by the same complex number leaves the index
principal value unchanged, so the winding number and null-homology are invariant.

These lemmas are bookkeeping for the roadmap's curve and cycle layer. The geometry of the
generalized winding number is local at a crossing or sector, and finite-decomposition arguments
frequently translate the crossing point to the origin before applying the model computation.

## Main results

* `Contour.windingNumber_translate` — translating the curve and base point together preserves
  the generalized winding number.
* `Contour.IsNullHomologous.translate` — null-homology is preserved by translating both the
  curve and the ambient set.

## Provenance

This is routine API around the Hungerbühler--Wasem generalized winding number from the contour
integration roadmap; no formal source is vendored.
