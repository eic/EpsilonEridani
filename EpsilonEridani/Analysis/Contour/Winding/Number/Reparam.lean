# Reparametrization invariance of the generalized winding number

Precomposing a curve `γ` with a `C¹` change of parameter `φ` leaves the generalized winding number
of Hungerbühler–Wasem (Def 2.1) about a point off the curve unchanged, the parameter interval
`[[a, b]]` being replaced by `[[φ a, φ b]]`; null-homology in an ambient set transports the same
way. These are consequences of the reparametrization invariance of the contour integral proved in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Contour/Curve/Reparam.lean`. As there, "`C¹`" is shorthand for ambient pointwise
`HasDerivAt`/`DifferentiableAt` data, and the curve is asked to be `C¹` with no breakpoints — the
piecewise-`C¹` case is a separate increment.

As there, the regularity hypotheses on `γ` are placed on the swept image `φ '' [[a, b]]` rather than
on `[[φ a, φ b]]`: `φ` is not assumed monotone, and `intermediate_value_uIcc` gives
`[[φ a, φ b]] ⊆ φ '' [[a, b]]`, so hypotheses on the image also cover the reparametrized interval.

Only the off-curve case is treated: when `z₀` lies on the curve the winding number is a Cauchy
principal value, whose symmetric excision windows are themselves reparametrized, and transporting
them is a separate argument. This is the case that the roadmap's cycle bookkeeping consumes.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_comp_reparam` — the generalized winding number about a point off
  the curve is unchanged by a `C¹` reparametrization.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_comp_mul_add` — the affine special case `φ t = r * t + s`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.IsNullHomologous.comp_reparam` — null-homology transports along a `C¹`
  reparametrization of a curve lying in the ambient set.

This is Layer 0 of the Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem (HW Thm 3.3): the
reparametrization-invariance API that the cycle layer needs in order to treat a closed curve
independently of its parametrization.

## Provenance

This is routine API around the Hungerbühler--Wasem generalized winding number from the contour
integration roadmap; no formal source is vendored.

/-- **Reparametrization invariance of the generalized winding number** (HW Def 2.1), for a point
`z₀` off the curve. Precomposing with a change of parameter `φ` that has an ambient derivative
`φ' t` at each `t ∈ [[a, b]]`, with `φ'` continuous, leaves the winding number unchanged, the
parameter interval `[[a, b]]` being replaced by `[[φ a, φ b]]`.

The hypotheses on `γ` are stated on the swept image `φ '' [[a, b]]`, which contains `[[φ a, φ b]]`
by the intermediate value theorem, so `φ` need not be monotone. Off-curve is essential: on the
curve the winding number is a principal value, whose excision windows are themselves
reparametrized. -/
