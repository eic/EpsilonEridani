# Concatenation API for the generalized winding number

This file records the additivity of `Contour.windingNumber` over adjacent parameter intervals.
The contour-integration roadmap uses finite decompositions of a curve into an avoiding part and
model sectors in Hungerbühler--Wasem Proposition 2.2; those decompositions need to add the
corresponding generalized winding numbers after the principal values on the pieces have been
constructed.

The results here are deliberately conditional on the relevant pointwise principal-value
existence statements. The generalized winding number is a `limUnder`-based value, so without those
witnesses it is a junk value; the characteristic lemmas below keep the additivity statement tied to
honest principal values.

## Main results

* `Contour.windingNumber_eq_add_of_hasCauchyPVAt` — additivity from explicit principal-value
  witnesses on two adjacent intervals.
* `Contour.windingNumber_concat` — additivity from principal-value existence on the two adjacent
  intervals, using the canonical `cauchyPVAt` values.
* `Contour.IsNullHomologous.concat` — if a curve is null-homologous on both adjacent intervals and
  the exterior pointwise principal values exist on those intervals, then it is null-homologous on
  their concatenation.
* `Contour.IsNullHomologous.concat_of_avoidance` — the same conclusion in the common case where
  both curve pieces lie in the domain, so exterior points are avoided and the principal values are
  ordinary integrals.

## Provenance

This is routine API around the Hungerbühler--Wasem generalized winding number from the contour
integration roadmap; no formal source is vendored.

then the winding number over `[a, c]` is the sum of the two winding numbers. -/

that the principal values defining the two summand winding numbers exist; the principal value on
the concatenated interval is then supplied by `HasCauchyPVAt.concat`. -/

/-- Null-homology is preserved by concatenating adjacent parameter intervals, provided the

the form used by finite decomposition arguments: after proving the exterior winding numbers vanish

/-- Null-homology is preserved by concatenating adjacent intervals in the ordinary avoided-pole
