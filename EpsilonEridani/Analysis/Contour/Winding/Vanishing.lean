# The winding number vanishes far from a bounded closed curve

For a closed curve `γ` continuous on the compact interval `Set.uIcc a b` (so its image is bounded),
differentiable off a countable set, with interval-integrable derivative, the generalized winding
number `fun w ↦ windingNumber γ a b w` vanishes for every `w` sufficiently far from the origin:
`windingNumber_eventually_zero_cocompact` states this as an eventual property along the cocompact
filter, together with the fact that such `w` lie off the curve. This is the input to the Liouville
step of Dixon's proof of the homology form of Cauchy's theorem (roadmap `homologyCauchyTheorem`):
the Dixon function agrees with `dixonH2` wherever the winding number is zero.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_eventually_zero_cocompact` — off the curve, the winding number is
  eventually `0` along `cocompact ℂ`.

## Provenance

Adapted from `winding_eventually_zero_cocompact_of_lipschitz` in `NullHomologous.lean` of the
AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` development. The raw-function port replaces the Lipschitz derivative
bound with the `L¹` norm `∫ ‖deriv γ‖`, so continuity on the compact interval (which bounds the
image) and interval-integrability of the derivative suffice — no Lipschitz hypothesis.

/-- **The winding number is eventually zero far from a bounded closed curve.** For a closed curve
`γ` (`γ a = γ b`) continuous on `Set.uIcc a b`, differentiable off a countable set `P`, with
interval-integrable derivative, every point `w` far enough from the origin lies off the curve and
has winding number `0`; equivalently, `fun w ↦ (γ avoids w) ∧ windingNumber γ a b w = 0` holds
eventually along `cocompact ℂ`. The bounded image (continuity on the compact interval) and the
integer-valuedness of the winding number for a closed curve force the small far-field value to be
exactly `0`. -/
