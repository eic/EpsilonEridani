# The real bounded-integrand formula for the winding number (Hungerbühler–Wasem Prop 2.3)

For a closed piecewise-`C¹` curve `γ` that avoids a point `w`, Hungerbühler–Wasem Prop 2.3 evaluates
the generalized winding number by the **real** integral

`n_w(γ) = (1 / 2π) ∫_a^b (x ẏ − y ẋ) / (x² + y²) dt`,

where `x + i y = γ − w`. Writing `γ − w = x + i y` and `γ' = ẋ + i ẏ`, the winding integrand
`(γ − w)⁻¹ · γ'` has imaginary part exactly `(x ẏ − y ẋ) / (x² + y²)` (the real integrand above,
here with denominator `Complex.normSq (γ − w) = x² + y²`); this pointwise piece is
`realWindingIntegrand_eq_div`. For a point *off* the curve the
winding number is a genuine integer (`exists_int_windingNumber_of_closed`), hence real, so the
ordinary index integral `(2πi)⁻¹ ∮_γ dz/(z − w)` is purely imaginary: its real part vanishes and its
imaginary part is the real integral above. This is the off-curve (no principal-value) case of the
real formula — the computational workhorse of Layer 1; the on-curve bounded-integrand form and the
`½·k·|Λ̇|` crossing value need the immersion geometry and stay separate.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_eq_real_integral_of_closed` — the winding number of a closed curve
  off `w` equals the real bounded integral `(1 / 2π) ∫ (x ẏ − y ẋ) / (x² + y²)`.

This is Layer 1 of the Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem (HW Thm 3.3).

## Provenance

The pointwise imaginary-part decomposition and the real winding formula are migrated and cleaned
from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` generalized-winding-number development, restated here for a raw
`γ : ℝ → ℂ` on an oriented interval in the vocabulary the roadmap fixes.

/-- **The real bounded-integrand formula for the winding number** (Hungerbühler–Wasem Prop 2.3,
off-curve case). For a curve `γ` on the oriented interval with endpoints `a`, `b` that returns to
its start (`γ a = γ b`), is continuous on `Set.uIcc a b`, differentiable off a countable set `P`,
avoids
`w` throughout, and has an interval-integrable index integrand, the generalized winding number about
`w` is the real integral

`n_w(γ) = (1 / 2π) ∫_a^b (x ẏ − y ẋ) / (x² + y²) dt`,   `x + i y = γ − w`,

with bounded real integrand and no principal value. The winding number is a genuine integer here
(`exists_int_windingNumber_of_closed`), so the index integral is purely imaginary; its imaginary
part is this real integral (`realWindingIntegrand_eq_div`), while its real part — the
increment of `log ‖γ − w‖` —
vanishes by closedness. -/
