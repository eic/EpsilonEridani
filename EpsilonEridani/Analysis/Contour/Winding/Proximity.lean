# Proximity invariance of the winding number

Two closed curves that stay closer to each other than the first one stays to `w` have the same
winding number about `w`. This is the "dog on a leash" principle: the leash from `γ₀ t` to `γ₁ t`
is too short to reach `w`, so the two walks encircle `w` the same number of times.

The proof compares the two curves through the quotient `σ t = (γ₁ t - w) / (γ₀ t - w)`. The
hypothesis says exactly that `‖σ t - 1‖ < 1`, so `σ` runs inside the open right half-plane; its own
winding number about `0` therefore vanishes, because the closed left half-plane is an unbounded
connected subset of the complement of its image. Since the index integrands satisfy
`σ' / σ = γ₁' / (γ₁ - w) - γ₀' / (γ₀ - w)` pointwise, that vanishing is the asserted equality.

The Layer 0 item this serves is homotopy invariance of the winding number off the curve.
`Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.windingNumber_eq_of_notMem_segment` deduces invariance
along the straight-line homotopy `s ↦ (1 - s) • γ₀ + s • γ₁` from the purely geometric hypothesis
that the segment `[γ₀ t, γ₁ t]` misses `w` for every parameter `t`: the intermediate curves are
piecewise `C¹` because that predicate is stable under affine combinations, and a compactness
estimate lets finitely many of them be chained together by the leash lemma.

## Main results

* `Contour.windingNumber_eq_of_dist_lt_dist` — the raw-hypothesis form: closed curves that are
  continuous, differentiable off a countable set, and have interval-integrable derivatives, with
  `dist (γ₁ t) (γ₀ t) < dist (γ₀ t) w` throughout, have equal winding numbers about `w`.
* `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.windingNumber_eq_of_dist_lt_dist` — the same for closed piecewise-`C¹`
  curves, whose regularity supplies the raw hypotheses on its own.
* `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.windingNumber_eq_of_dist_lt_dist_of_eq_endpoints` — the common-endpoint
  version for paths that need not be closed.
* `Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.windingNumber_eq_of_notMem_segment` — invariance along the
  straight-line homotopy: if `w ∉ [γ₀ t, γ₁ t]` for every `t`, the winding numbers agree.

## Provenance

The comparison-quotient argument is the standard proof of the "dog on a leash" lemma (equivalently,
the homotopy form of Rouché's theorem); see the references in the Contour Integration roadmap,
e.g. L. Ahlfors, *Complex Analysis*, Ch. 4. No formal source is vendored.

/-- Core comparison-quotient form of proximity invariance. The raw curves are regular enough to
integrate, stay within leash distance, and have a closed comparison quotient. The public closed
curve and common-endpoint forms below supply the last hypothesis.

The comparison quotient `σ = (γ₁ - w) / (γ₀ - w)` is then a closed curve inside the open right
half-plane, so `0` lies in an unbounded component of the complement of its image and
`n_0(σ) = 0`; pointwise `σ' / σ = γ₁' / (γ₁ - w) - γ₀' / (γ₀ - w)`, so `n_0(σ)` is the difference
of the two winding numbers. -/
