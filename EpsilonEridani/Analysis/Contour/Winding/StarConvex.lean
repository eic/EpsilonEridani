# Curves in a star-shaped set are null-homologous there

A closed piecewise-`C¹` curve drawn inside a set `Ω` that is star-shaped about `x` has winding
number `0` about every point outside `Ω`. The proof is the straight-line contraction of the curve
to the constant curve at the centre: for each parameter `t` the segment from `γ t` to `x` lies in
`Ω` by star-convexity, hence misses every `w ∉ Ω`, so
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.windingNumber_eq_of_notMem_segment` equates `n_w(γ)` with the
winding number of a constant curve, which is `0`.

This discharges the `EpsilonEridani.Contour.IsNullHomologous` hypothesis carried by the Layer 3 homology
Cauchy theorem and by everything above it, on the domains that ordinary applications supply — a
disc, a half-plane, a strip, a rectangle, the slit plane. Star-shapedness is a condition on the
*domain* alone: nothing is asked of the curve beyond the piecewise-`C¹` regularity that the
statements already carry. The homotopy route,
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.isNullHomologous_of_pathHomotopy_refl`, covers strictly more domains, but asks the
caller to exhibit a contracting homotopy; a star-shaped domain supplies one for free.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_eq_zero_of_starConvex` — a closed piecewise-`C¹` curve in a
  star-shaped set has winding number `0` about every point outside that set.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.isNullHomologous_of_starConvex` — such a curve is null-homologous there, and
  `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.isNullHomologous_of_starConvex` for a contour cycle.

A convex `Ω` is star-shaped about any of its points, so a caller holding `hconv : Convex ℝ Ω` and a
curve in `Ω` supplies `hconv.starConvex (hγΩ a left_mem_uIcc)`.

## Provenance

No formalization is vendored. That a cycle in a star-shaped (indeed, in a simply connected) domain
is null-homologous is standard complex analysis; see the references of the contour integration
roadmap, e.g. Lang, *Complex Analysis*, Ch. IV.

/-- **The winding number vanishes at every point outside a star-shaped set containing the curve.**
If the closed piecewise-`C¹` curve `γ` stays in a set `Ω` star-shaped about `x` and `w ∉ Ω`, then
`n_w(γ) = 0`. Indeed, the straight-line contraction of `γ` to the centre `x` stays in `Ω`, so it
avoids `w`. -/
