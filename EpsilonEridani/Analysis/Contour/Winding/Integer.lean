# The winding number of a closed curve is an integer

For a curve `γ` on an interval that returns to its start (`γ a = γ b`), avoids a point `w`, and is
regular enough — continuous, differentiable off a countable set, with an interval-integrable index
integrand — its generalized winding number about `w` is an integer (see
`exists_int_windingNumber_of_closed` for the exact hypotheses). This is the integrality step on the
Hungerbühler–Wasem path (HW Thm 3.3): combined with continuity of the winding number in the point,
it makes the winding number locally constant on the complement of the curve — the input to the
homology form of Cauchy's theorem.

Closing the curve is the only thing used here: `exp_two_pi_I_mul_windingNumber_of_avoidance`
evaluates `exp (2πi · n_w(γ))` as the endpoint ratio `(γ b - w) / (γ a - w)` for any avoiding arc,
and `γ a = γ b` makes that ratio `1`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.exists_int_windingNumber_of_closed` — the generalized winding number of a closed
  curve is an integer.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On.exists_int_windingNumber` — the same for a closed piecewise-`C¹`
  curve, whose regularity supplies the raw hypotheses on its own.

## Provenance

Adapted from `hasGeneralizedWindingNumber_integer_of_closed` in `WindingInteger.lean` of the AINTLIB
`LeanModularForms` development, restated for a raw `γ : ℝ → ℂ` on an oriented interval. The
argument-lift computation that used to sit here now lives in `Winding.EndpointRatio`, which proves
it for arcs that need not close up.

with endpoints `a`, `b` that returns to its start (`γ a = γ b`), is continuous on `Set.uIcc a b`,
differentiable off a countable set `P`, avoids `w` throughout `Set.uIcc a b`, and has an
interval-integrable index integrand `(γ · - w)⁻¹ * deriv γ`, the generalized winding number
`windingNumber γ a b w` is an integer. -/
