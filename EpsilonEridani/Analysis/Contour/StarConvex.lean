# Contour integration in a star-shaped domain

Layer 3 of the contour integration roadmap proves the homology Cauchy theorem, and Layers 2 and 4
state the residue theorems, for a cycle that is **null-homologous** in the domain of holomorphy.
That hypothesis is the right one — it is exactly what the proofs need — but it is not the one an
application arrives with. An application arrives with an open disc, half-plane, strip, open
rectangle or slit plane, or with a convex open neighborhood of a rectangle or triangle, and a
contour drawn inside it.

`EpsilonEridani.Contour.isNullHomologous_of_starConvex` closes that gap: a closed curve in a set that is
star-shaped about some point is null-homologous there. This file records the resulting
hypothesis-free statements:

* Cauchy's theorem `∮_γ f = 0`, for a curve and for a cycle, and its `Metric.ball` case;
* Cauchy's integral formula `n_z(γ) · f(z) = (2πi)⁻¹ ∮_γ f/(· − z)` in every derivative order, for
  a curve, and its `Metric.ball` case;
* the classical residue theorem `∮_γ f = 2πi · Σ_s n_s(γ) · Res_s f` for poles off the curve, for a
  curve and for a cycle;
* the argument principle, in the ordinary and the principal-value (zeros **on** the curve) forms,
  for a curve;
* the Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem in its unconditional simple-pole regime,
  singularities on the curve included, for a curve and for a cycle, together with the half-residue
  case.

In each the hypothesis `IsNullHomologous` disappears, replaced by star-shapedness and openness of
the ambient domain. Star-shapedness is genuinely a hypothesis on the *domain*, not on the curve:
nothing is asked of `γ` beyond the piecewise-`C¹` regularity (or, where a principal value is taken,
the immersion regularity) that every statement of the tower already carries.

The relation to the other route to null-homology,
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.isNullHomologous_of_pathHomotopy_refl`, is one-way: a star-shaped domain
contracts, so every loop in it is null-homotopic there and the homotopy hypothesis is implied. The
value of the statements below is that the caller never has to build that homotopy. Conversely the
homotopy route reaches strictly more domains, at the cost of exhibiting the contraction.

A convex `Ω` is star-shaped about any of its points; a caller holding `hconv : Convex ℝ Ω` and a
curve in `Ω` supplies `hconv.starConvex (hγΩ a left_mem_uIcc)`, and the `Metric.ball` statements
below do exactly that.

## Roadmap

The disc statements `EpsilonEridani.Contour.cauchyTheorem_ball` and
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.cauchyIntegralFormula_ball`, with the star-shaped statements they specialise, are
Layer 2's "Cauchy's theorem for a contractible contour as a corollary (reconciled with Mathlib's
disc statements)": Mathlib's disc Cauchy theory integrates over the bounding circle, and these
extend it to an arbitrary closed piecewise-`C¹` curve inside the disc. The residue and argument
statements are what makes the rest of the tower applicable at all: Layer 2's classical residue
theorem and argument principle, and Layer 4's Hungerbühler–Wasem theorem, are all stated for a
null-homologous cycle, and the roadmap's acceptance criteria — poles inside a circle, a simple pole
*on* the contour contributing the half-residue, an improper integral along the real axis — are
posed on a disc or a half-plane, which are star-shaped. The roadmap's first client, the valence
formula, integrates `logDeriv f` around a contour in the upper half-plane, which is star-shaped
too, and passes through the elliptic points, so it consumes
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.hasCauchyPV_logDeriv_starConvex`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.cauchyTheorem_starConvex`, `EpsilonEridani.Contour.cauchyIntegralFormula_starConvex` —
  Cauchy's theorem and integral formula on a star-shaped open set.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.classicalResidueTheorem_starConvex`,
  `EpsilonEridani.Contour.argumentPrinciple_starConvex` — the residue theorem and the argument principle
  there.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.hasCauchyPV_logDeriv_starConvex`,
  `EpsilonEridani.Contour.hungerbuhlerWasem_residueTheorem_of_simple_poles_starConvex` — the
  principal-value statements, whose singularities may lie on the curve.
* `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.cauchyTheorem_starConvex`,
  `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.classicalResidueTheorem_starConvex`,
  `EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.hungerbuhlerWasem_residueTheorem_of_simple_poles_starConvex` — the cycle
  forms.

## Provenance

No formalization is vendored: each statement is its null-homologous counterpart with the
null-homology discharged by `EpsilonEridani.Contour.isNullHomologous_of_starConvex`.

Unlike `EpsilonEridani.Contour.classicalResidueTheorem_circle`, the curve is arbitrary and the poles need
not be enclosed: a pole in a component of the complement that `γ` does not wind around simply gets
weight `0`. -/
