# The increment of a function along a segment

This file bounds the increment of a function between `x` and `x + h` by the integral of its
directional derivative along the segment joining them. It is the multi-dimensional form of
Mathlib's one-dimensional `enorm_sub_le_lintegral_deriv_of_contDiffOn_Icc`, obtained by
composing with the affine parametrization `t ↦ x + t • h` of the segment.

The hypotheses of the first estimate are local to the segment: differentiability at each of its
points and continuity of the directional derivative along it. The normalized real-valued estimate
instead assumes continuity of the function along the parameterized segment, differentiability at
interior parameters, and interval integrability of the norm of the full Fréchet derivative rather
than continuity merely of its fixed directional evaluation; these hypotheses are needed only when
the segment has positive length.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.enorm_sub_le_lintegral_enorm_fderiv_apply`: the segment increment estimate.
* `EpsilonEridani.norm_sub_le_integral_norm_fderiv_along_segment`: the corresponding normalized
  real-integral estimate.

difference-quotient characterization of Sobolev functions.

/-- The oscillation of a function along a segment is bounded by the integrated norm of its
Fréchet derivative along that segment. For distinct endpoints, the function is continuous along
the closed parameter interval, differentiable at its interior parameters, and the operator-norm
bound is interval-integrable. The zero-length segment requires no analytic hypotheses.
