# The length of a path measured against a density

A **density** on a real normed space `F` is a function `ρ : F → ℝ`, thought of as a variable
conversion factor between the ambient norm and the length one wishes to measure. The length of a
path `γ : ℝ → F` over the parameter interval with endpoints `a` and `b` measured against `ρ` is

`EpsilonEridani.densityLength ρ γ a b = ∫ t in uIcc a b, ρ (γ t) * ‖deriv γ t‖`,

the Euclidean speed `‖deriv γ t‖` weighted by the density at the point the path is passing
through. Taking `ρ = 1` gives the ordinary length of a `C¹` path; taking `ρ z = (1 - ‖z‖ ^ 2)⁻¹`
on the complex unit disc gives the hyperbolic length of
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Hyperbolic/Length.lean`, which is where this file's consumers
are.

## Why the definition is at this level

Everything proved below is a statement about the *parameter* side of the integral: how the length
responds to reversing, splitting or substituting in the parameter interval, and to changing the
path off that interval. The reparametrisation and interval-calculus results carry the density
along unchanged, as an arbitrary function of the point, and only `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_nonneg`
inspects it at all, asking it to be nonnegative along the path; and none of it looks at the
codomain beyond its norm, so `F` is an arbitrary real normed space and `γ` an arbitrary map — not
necessarily continuous, let alone differentiable, `deriv` reading its junk value where the path is
not differentiable (`EpsilonEridani.densityLength_eq_integral` is the reformulation for a path with a
known derivative). The hypotheses appear only where the mathematics needs them: nonnegativity of
the density for `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_nonneg`, differentiability of the path for the two
substitution rules, which differentiate the composite, and integrability of the two integrands for
the comparison `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_le_densityLength`, without which two comparable integrands
need not have comparable integrals. The pointwise hypotheses are asked at the *interior*
parameters only, the two endpoints forming a null set, and the displacement bound asks its
comparison there only almost everywhere.

The one estimate that leaves the pair `(ρ, γ)` is `EpsilonEridani.norm_sub_le_densityLength`, and it too
is a statement about the parameter side: a function of the parameter whose speed is dominated by
the density-weighted speed of `γ` is displaced, over the parameter interval, by no more than the
length of `γ` over it. It runs in a second normed space of its own, unrelated to `F`, the
hypothesis again comparing only real-valued speeds.

The integral is taken over the **unordered** interval `uIcc a b`, as in Mathlib's
`Manifold.pathELength`. This is what makes the length independent of the orientation of the
parameter interval (`EpsilonEridani.densityLength_symm`) and nonnegative for a nonnegative density
whichever way round the endpoints are (`EpsilonEridani.densityLength_nonneg`), and it is why the
substitution rules below hold for antitone substitutions
(`EpsilonEridani.densityLength_comp_of_deriv_nonpos`) as they stand for monotone ones, with no sign
correction.

## Relation to Mathlib

Mathlib's `Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/Riemannian/PathELength.lean` defines `Manifold.pathELength`,
the `ℝ≥0∞`-valued length of a path in a charted space each of whose tangent spaces carries an
`ENorm`, and `Manifold.riemannianEDist`, the infimum of such lengths. The two notions are
different in both directions: `pathELength` measures with a norm on each tangent space, which
subsumes a scalar density only after the ambient space is given a manifold structure and its
tangent spaces the corresponding `ENorm`s, and it is `ℝ≥0∞`-valued, whereas a density-weighted
length of a `C¹` path is an ordinary real number and is compared with real-valued distances
downstream. `densityLength` is therefore the elementary interval integral rather than a
`pathELength` specialisation, and the two share no lemma. Should the density-weighted case later
be routed through a Riemannian structure, the statements below are the ones to refactor.

The substitution rules are Mathlib's change of variables for a monotone or antitone substitution
(`intervalIntegral.integral_deriv_smul_comp_of_deriv_nonneg` and its `nonpos` counterpart) read
through the chain rule; the affine rule is `intervalIntegral.integral_comp_mul_add`; and the
displacement bound is Mathlib's `norm_sub_le_integral_of_norm_deriv_le_of_le`, freed from the
ordering of the parameter interval.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.densityLength` — the `ρ`-weighted length of a path over a parameter interval.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_symm`, `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_self`, `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_const` —
  the length is unoriented, degenerate intervals and constant paths contributing nothing.
* `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_eq_integral` — the length computed from an explicit derivative, the
  derivative being needed only at the interior parameters.
* `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_nonneg` — a nonnegative density gives a nonnegative length.
* `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_congr_of_eqOn` and `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_le_densityLength` — two paths
  whose density-weighted speeds agree inside the parameter interval have equal lengths, and two
  whose integrable speeds compare there have comparable lengths.
* `EpsilonEridani.norm_sub_le_densityLength` — **displacement is at most the length**: a function of the
  parameter whose speed is dominated by the density-weighted speed of the path moves, across the
  parameter interval, by no more than the length of the path over it.
* `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_congr` — the length depends on the path only through its restriction to
  the interior of the parameter interval.
* `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_add` — additivity along the parameter interval.
* `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_comp_mul_add`, `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_comp_of_deriv_nonneg`,
  `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_comp_of_deriv_nonpos` — invariance under affine, monotone and antitone
  reparametrisation: the length is a property of the path, not of its parametrisation.

/-- The **length of the path `γ` measured against the density `ρ`**, over the parameter interval
with endpoints `a` and `b`: the Euclidean speed `‖deriv γ t‖` integrated over the unordered
interval `uIcc a b` against the weight `ρ (γ t)`.

Taking the integral over the unordered interval makes the length independent of the orientation
of the parameter interval (`EpsilonEridani.densityLength_symm`); together with
`EpsilonEridani.densityLength_comp_of_deriv_nonneg` and `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_comp_of_deriv_nonpos` this
makes it a reparametrisation invariant of the path.

The definition asks nothing of `γ` or of `ρ`; only the derivative at the interior parameters
enters (`EpsilonEridani.densityLength_eq_integral`), the two endpoints forming a null set. It is the
intended notion of length when `γ` is a `C¹` path and `ρ` is a positive continuous density, which
is what the comparisons with a distance downstream assume; the evaluations of the length itself
need no such hypothesis. -/

/-- **Comparing density-weighted speeds compares the lengths.** If at every interior parameter the
density-weighted speed of `δ` is at most that of `γ`, and both speeds are integrable over the
parameter interval, then `δ` is no longer than `γ` over it, whichever way round its endpoints are.

Nothing relates the two paths, or the two densities, beyond that pointwise comparison — not even
the space they run in, the hypotheses comparing only their real-valued weighted speeds — which is
the form in which a contraction property of a map post-composed with a path — a Schwarz--Pick
estimate, say — arrives: the chain rule turns the density-weighted speed of the composite into a
factor bounded by the density at the point times the speed of the path. The comparison is the
inequality counterpart of `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_congr_of_eqOn`, which needs no integrability
because equal integrands have equal integrals whether or not they are integrable. As there, the
comparison is between the integrands that define the two lengths, and is asked at the interior
parameters only, the two endpoints forming a null set; a path with an explicit derivative is read
through `HasDerivAt.deriv`. Integrability, unlike that comparison, is a genuinely additional
hypothesis: the density being arbitrary here, regularity of the path alone does not supply it, and
it is the `C¹` path *together with* a density continuous along it that does — as in the hyperbolic
application, where the path stays in the open disc on which the Poincaré density is continuous. -/

density-weighted speed of `γ`, then `u` moves across the interval by at most the `ρ`-length of `γ`
over it, whichever way round the endpoints are.

This is how a length bounds a distance. Taking for `u` a quantity that the length is to dominate —
for the Poincaré density on the disc, `Real.artanh ∘ (fun t => (v * γ t).re)` for a unit vector
`v`, a linear functional of `γ` read through `Real.artanh` rather than `Real.artanh ‖γ‖`, which
is not differentiable where the path crosses the origin — reduces the bound to the comparison
`hbound` between two speeds, exactly as
`EpsilonEridani.densityLength_le_densityLength` reduces a comparison of two lengths to one. Nothing
relates `u` to `γ` beyond that comparison, not even the space it runs in: `u` takes values in a
normed space of its own, and the density-weighted speed of `γ` enters only as a real-valued upper
estimate on `‖deriv u‖`. Integrability of that estimate is needed for the same reason as there,
and both hypotheses are asked at the *interior* parameters only, the two endpoints forming a null
set — the comparison, as in Mathlib's `norm_sub_le_integral_of_norm_deriv_le_of_le`, only almost
everywhere there, a bound holding at every interior parameter being read through
`Filter.Eventually.of_forall`; a `u` with an explicit derivative is read through
`HasDerivAt.deriv`. -/

/-- **The length is invariant under antitone reparametrisation.** The orientation-reversing
counterpart of `EpsilonEridani.densityLength_comp_of_deriv_nonneg`: precomposing a path with a map `φ`
that is continuous on the parameter interval and has a nonpositive derivative inside it — so that
`φ` is antitone there — leaves the length unchanged, the parameter interval being transported with
its orientation reversed. Together the two lemmas say that the length is a property of a path
rather than of its parametrisation. -/
