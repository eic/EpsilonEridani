# Boundedness near an endpoint from a continuous derivative

A function on the reals whose right derivative just to the right of `a` is given by a function
right-continuous at `a` stays bounded as the variable tends to `a` from the right. The derivative
is bounded on a short interval `(a, a + ε)`, so the mean value inequality bounds the function
there.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_norm_le_of_hasDerivWithinAt_of_continuousWithinAt`: if `f' = g` on a right
  neighbourhood of `a` and `g` is right-continuous at `a`, then `‖f t‖` is eventually bounded as
  `t → a⁺`.

/-- **Boundedness near `a⁺` from a derivative continuous at `a⁺`.** If `f : ℝ → E` has derivative
`g u` within `(a, ∞)` at every `u` in a right neighbourhood of `a`, and `g` is continuous at `a`
within `(a, ∞)`, then `‖f t‖` is eventually bounded as `t` tends to `a` from the right. -/
