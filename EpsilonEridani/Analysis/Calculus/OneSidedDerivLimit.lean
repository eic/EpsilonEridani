# One-sided derivatives from one-sided derivative limits

A function continuous at `t₀`, differentiable on a one-sided punctured neighbourhood, whose
derivative tends to `L` from that side, has one-sided derivative `L` at `t₀`. Mathlib's
`hasDerivWithinAt_Ici_of_tendsto_deriv` states this over a set containing a right neighbourhood;
these wrappers put it in the `𝓝[>] t₀` / `𝓝[<] t₀` eventual form in which piecewise-`C¹` curve
data arrives.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.hasDerivWithinAt_Ioi_of_tendsto_deriv` — the right-sided derivative from a right
  derivative limit.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasDerivWithinAt_Iio_of_tendsto_deriv` — the left counterpart.

## Provenance

Migrated from `hasDerivWithinAt_Ioi_of_tendsto` and `hasDerivWithinAt_Iio_of_tendsto` of
`FlatnessConditions.lean` in the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` development. Prerequisite for the
crossing analysis of the generalized residue theorem on the roadmap, where the one-sided
tangents of a piecewise-`C¹` curve are recovered from derivative limits.
