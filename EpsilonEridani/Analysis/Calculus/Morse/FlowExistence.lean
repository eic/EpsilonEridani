# Existence of the negative gradient flow

The dynamical description of Morse theory reads its trajectory spaces off a *flow*: stable and
unstable sets, and the Lyapunov theory of a decreasing function along trajectories, are statements
about a `Flow.IsNegativeGradient` flow. This file produces such a flow for every function whose
gradient is globally Lipschitz, by feeding `-∇ f` to `EpsilonEridani.flowOfLipschitz`.

Global Lipschitz continuity of `∇ f` is a sufficient hypothesis for the trajectories to exist for
all time; it holds for instance whenever `f` is `C²` with a bounded second derivative, and in
particular for the split quadratic model.

Throughout, `∇ f` is Mathlib's gradient: a function defined for every `f`, taking the value `0`
wherever `f` is not differentiable.  What is constructed below is therefore the flow of the vector
field `-∇ f`, and no differentiability of `f` is assumed for it, exactly as the predicate
`Flow.IsNegativeGradient` it witnesses assumes none.  Differentiability of `f` is what makes that
field the gradient field of `f`, and it enters where the flow is used as a *gradient* flow rather
than as the flow of a Lipschitz field: `EpsilonEridani.negativeGradientFlow_orbit_antitone` records
Lyapunov descent along any orbit on which `f` is differentiable.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.negativeGradientFlow`: the negative gradient flow of a function with globally Lipschitz
  gradient.
* `EpsilonEridani.isNegativeGradient_negativeGradientFlow`: it is a negative gradient flow of `f`.
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_negativeGradientFlow`: every global negative gradient trajectory is one of its
  orbits.
* `EpsilonEridani.negativeGradientFlow_congr`: it does not depend on the chosen Lipschitz bound.
* `EpsilonEridani.forall_negativeGradientFlow_eq_self_iff`: its rest points are the zeros of `∇ f`.
* `EpsilonEridani.negativeGradientFlow_orbit_antitone`: `f` decreases along an orbit on which it is
  differentiable.

/-- **The negative gradient flow** of a function whose gradient is globally Lipschitz.

This is the flow of the vector field `-∇ f`.  For a differentiable `f` that field is the negative
gradient field and this is the negative gradient flow in the usual sense; for an `f` that is not
differentiable everywhere it is the flow of Mathlib's totalized gradient field, which is the
object the hypothesis `LipschitzWith K (∇ f)` speaks about. -/
