# Sard's lemma when the source has smaller dimension

This file proves the lower-dimensional-source case of finite-dimensional Sard's theorem. If a
differentiable map goes from a finite-dimensional real normed space to one of strictly larger
dimension, then the image of every subset of the source has additive Haar measure zero. In
particular, the whole range is null.

Every derivative in this dimension range is nonsurjective, so the range is exactly the set of
critical values. The proof uses the Hausdorff-dimension route already developed in Mathlib:
`DifferentiableOn.dimH_image_le` says that differentiable maps do not increase dimension, and
`measure_zero_of_dimH_lt` turns the resulting strict dimension bound into nullity. Uniqueness of
additive Haar measure transfers the statement from Hausdorff measure to any Haar normalization.

This supplies the source-dimension-smaller-than-target case of finite-dimensional Sard in Lane F0
of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap. Together with the equal-dimensional case, it isolates the
higher-regularity Morse--Sard argument to the remaining case where the source dimension is larger.

## Main declarations

* `DifferentiableOn.addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_dimH_lt_finrank`: a differentiable map on a
  set of sufficiently small Hausdorff dimension sends it to an additive-Haar-null set.
* `Differentiable.addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_finrank_lt_finrank`: a differentiable map into a
  strictly higher-dimensional space sends every subset to an additive-Haar-null set.
* `Differentiable.addHaar_range_eq_zero_of_finrank_lt_finrank`: the whole range of such a
  map is additive-Haar-null.
* `EpsilonEridani.not_surjective_fderiv_of_finrank_lt_finrank`: every derivative in this dimension range
  is nonsurjective.
* `EpsilonEridani.setOf_not_surjective_fderiv_eq_univ_of_finrank_lt_finrank`: every point belongs to the
  critical locus in this dimension range.
* `Differentiable.addHaar_image_not_surjective_fderiv_eq_zero_of_finrank_lt_finrank`: the
  critical values are additive-Haar-null, in the form used by Sard's theorem.

The Hausdorff-dimension argument follows the one used for the lower-dimensional Sard corollary in
Mathlib's `Topology.MetricSpace.HausdorffDimension`.
