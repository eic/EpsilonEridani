# Recovering a function from one of its exponentials

`Real.exp` is a smooth bijection onto `(0, ∞)` whose inverse `Real.log` is smooth there, so a
real-valued function `g` is exactly as regular as any single exponential `t ↦ e^{c g(t)}` built
from it with `c ≠ 0`.  Mathlib supplies the easy direction (`ContDiffOn.exp`, `Continuous.exp`);
this file records the converse, which recovers `g` as `c⁻¹ log (e^{c g})`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.contDiffOn_of_contDiffOn_exp_const_mul`: smoothness of `g` on a set follows from
  smoothness of `t ↦ e^{c g(t)}` there, for a single `c ≠ 0`.
* `EpsilonEridani.continuousOn_of_continuousOn_exp_const_mul`: the same for continuity.

/-- A real-valued function is smooth on a set as soon as one of its exponentials
`t ↦ e^{c g(t)}`, `c ≠ 0`, is: the exponential is positive, so composing with `Real.log` stays
inside the domain of smoothness of the logarithm, and `Real.log_exp` recovers `g` on the nose. -/
