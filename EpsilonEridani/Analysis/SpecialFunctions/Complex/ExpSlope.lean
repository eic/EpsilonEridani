# The difference quotient of a complex exponential at `0`, along the positive reals

For `c : ℂ`, the function `t ↦ exp (c t)` of a real variable has derivative `c` at `0`. This file
records that derivative in the one-sided difference-quotient form

`t⁻¹ • (exp (c t) - 1) → c` as `t → 0⁺`,

which is the shape a generator difference quotient takes: the semigroup parameter of a
C₀-semigroup runs over the nonnegative reals, so its generator is a limit along `𝓝[>] 0`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.tendsto_inv_smul_exp_mul_ofReal_sub_one`: the one-sided difference quotient of
  `t ↦ exp (c t)` at `0` tends to `c`.
