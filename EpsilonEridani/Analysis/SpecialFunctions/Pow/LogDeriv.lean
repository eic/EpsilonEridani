# The logarithmic derivative of a principal complex power

Raising a holomorphic function to a fixed complex exponent multiplies its logarithmic derivative
by that exponent, exactly as for an integer exponent
(`logDeriv_fun_zpow`).  The principal power `f ^ c` is holomorphic where `f` avoids the branch
cut, so the statement asks for `f x ∈ Complex.slitPlane`; there the base is nonzero and the
quotient `f x ^ (c - 1) / f x ^ c` collapses to `(f x)⁻¹`.

This is the branch-free shape in which a power appears in a pre-Schwarzian computation: the
logarithmic derivative of `f ^ c` remembers only the exponent and the logarithmic derivative of
the base, never the branch used to define the power.
