# The harmonic-oscillator eigen-equation for the Hermite functions

This file adds the **A2 oscillator milestone** of the `OrthogonalL2Bases` roadmap: the Hermite
functions `ψₙ` (`EpsilonEridani.hermiteFunction`, `ψₙ(x) = Hₙ(x√2) exp(-x²/2) / √(n!√π)`) are the
eigenfunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator,

`-ψₙ'' + x²·ψₙ = (2n+1)·ψₙ`.

The whole argument stays at the pointwise level and is built directly on the creation and
annihilation identities proved in `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Hermite.Function.Ladder`:

* `EpsilonEridani.mul_sub_deriv_hermiteFunction` — `x·ψₙ - ψₙ' = √(2(n+1))·ψ_{n+1}` (creation);
* `EpsilonEridani.mul_add_deriv_hermiteFunction` — `x·ψₙ + ψₙ' = √(2n)·ψ_{n-1}` (annihilation).

Writing `c = √(2(n+1))`, the creation identity gives `ψₙ' = x·ψₙ - c·ψ_{n+1}`, so differentiating
once more (product rule) and eliminating `ψ_{n+1}'` through the annihilation identity at index
`n+1` (`x·ψ_{n+1} + ψ_{n+1}' = c·ψₙ`, since `√(2(n+1))` is again `c`) collapses every neighbouring
mode, using only `c² = 2(n+1)`:

`ψₙ'' = ψₙ + x·ψₙ' - c·ψ_{n+1}' = x²·ψₙ - (2n+1)·ψₙ`.

The main results are the closed form of the second derivative,
`EpsilonEridani.deriv_deriv_hermiteFunction` (`ψₙ'' = (x² - (2n+1))·ψₙ`), and the eigen-equation
`EpsilonEridani.hermiteFunction_oscillator` in the roadmap's `-ψₙ'' + x²·ψₙ = (2n+1)·ψₙ` form.

No case split on `n` is needed: the neighbour that would require the Nat-clamped index `n-1` never
enters, because the derivation uses the creation identity at `n` and the annihilation identity at
`n+1`, whose lower index `(n+1)-1 = n` is exact.
