# Parseval and coordinates for the Hermite basis of `L²(ℝ)`

`EpsilonEridani.hermiteHilbertBasis` exhibits the Hermite functions as a Hilbert basis of `L²(ℝ; 𝕜)`.
This file states the expansion identities that basis was built for, phrased in terms of the
explicit vectors `EpsilonEridani.hermiteFunctionLp` rather than the bundled basis, so that a consumer
never has to unfold `hermiteHilbertBasis` to expand a function in Hermite functions.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.hermiteHilbertBasis_repr_apply` — the `n`-th coordinate of `f` is `⟪ψₙ, f⟫`.
* `EpsilonEridani.tsum_inner_mul_inner_hermiteFunctionLp` — Parseval in polarized form,
  `∑' n, ⟪f, ψₙ⟫ * ⟪ψₙ, g⟫ = ⟪f, g⟫`.
* `EpsilonEridani.tsum_norm_sq_inner_hermiteFunctionLp` — Parseval in norm-square form,
  `∑' n, ‖⟪ψₙ, f⟫‖² = ‖f‖²`.
* `EpsilonEridani.hermiteHilbertBasis_repr_self` — the coordinates of a basis vector are a single `1`.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasSum_hermiteFunctionLp_expansion` — the Hermite expansion `∑' n, ⟪ψₙ, f⟫ • ψₙ = f`.

Every statement holds for an arbitrary `RCLike` scalar field, so `𝕜 = ℝ` and `𝕜 = ℂ` are the same
theorem. The roadmap `OrthogonalL2Bases` Part A3 acceptance criteria on the coordinates and norm
of `ψ₀` follow by instantiating `hermiteHilbertBasis_repr_self` and
`tsum_norm_sq_inner_hermiteFunctionLp` at `f = ψ₀`, together with `norm_hermiteFunctionLp_zero`;
no separate declaration is needed for that specialization.
