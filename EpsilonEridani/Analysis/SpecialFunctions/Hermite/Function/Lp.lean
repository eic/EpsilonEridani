# Hermite functions as `L²` vectors

This file packages the pointwise Hermite functions `EpsilonEridani.hermiteFunction n` as elements of
`Lp 𝕜 2 volume`, for any `RCLike` scalar field `𝕜`.  This is the `hermiteFunctionLp` family
named in the `OrthogonalL2Bases` roadmap's Part A3: the later orthonormality and Hilbert-basis
theorems use these `Lp` vectors, while the analytic `L²` membership is supplied by
`EpsilonEridani.memLp_two_hermiteFunction`.

The a.e. representative lemmas are the anti-vacuity pins for downstream consumers: they expose
that the bundled `Lp` vectors are exactly the scalar casts of the explicit pointwise functions.
