# Integrability, `L²` membership, and normalization of the Hermite functions

This file continues the object API for the Hermite functions
`ψₙ(x) = Hₙ(x√2) exp(-x²/2) / √(n!√π)` (`EpsilonEridani.hermiteFunction`), adding the regularity facts
the `OrthogonalL2Bases` roadmap's **A2** milestone lists and its **A3** basis construction consumes:

* `EpsilonEridani.integrable_hermiteFunction` — every `ψₙ` is integrable against Lebesgue measure;
* `EpsilonEridani.memLp_two_hermiteFunction` — every `ψₙ` is in `L²(volume)`, the membership the
  `hermiteFunctionLp`/`hermiteHilbertBasis` layer needs to package `ψₙ` as an `Lp` element.
* `EpsilonEridani.integral_hermiteFunction_zero_mul_self` — the zeroth Hermite function has square
  integral one.

The membership results use the reusable engine
`EpsilonEridani.integrable_eval_mul_gaussianEnvelope`: a real polynomial evaluated pointwise, times a
Gaussian envelope `exp(-(x - μ)²/(2v))` of any center `μ` and positive variance `v`, is
Lebesgue-integrable. It is obtained by transporting the polynomial's integrability against the
Gaussian *measure* `gaussianReal μ v` (all of whose moments are finite,
`EpsilonEridani.integrable_pow_gaussianReal`, so `EpsilonEridani.integrable_eval_of_forall_integrable_pow`
applies) across the change of variables `gaussianReal μ v = volume.withDensity (gaussianPDF μ v)`
with `integrable_withDensity_iff`. Applied to the polynomial `Hₙ(·√2)` with `v = 1` this gives the
`L¹` membership, and to its square with `v = ½` (whose envelope `exp(-x²)` is `ψₙ²` up to the
constant) the `L²` membership. The zeroth-mode normalization additionally uses Mathlib's Gaussian
density normalization `integral_gaussianPDFReal_eq_one`.

Mathlib's Gaussian density API (`gaussianReal_of_var_ne_zero`, `measurable_gaussianPDF`,
`gaussianPDFReal_def`), `integrable_withDensity_iff`, `memLp_two_iff_integrable_sq`, and the
`Polynomial` evaluation API are consumed, not re-derived.

/-- The dilated Hermite polynomial `Hₙ(√2 · X)`, the polynomial whose Gaussian envelope is the
Hermite function `ψₙ`.

It is defined at this layer rather than at the basis layer because every `MemLp` result below is
already about it: `ψₙ` *is* this polynomial times `exp(-x²/2)`, up to normalization. -/
