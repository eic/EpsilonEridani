# The multi-index Hermite-function basis of `L²(ℝ^ι)`

The `Fintype`-indexed product of the one-dimensional Hermite-function basis: the multi-index family
`Ψ_a(x) = ∏ᵢ ψ_{aᵢ}(xᵢ)` is a Hilbert basis of `L²(volume^ι)`, the standard eigenbasis of the
`ℝ^ι` harmonic oscillator.

This is the Lebesgue-product-measure sibling of `EpsilonEridani.gaussianHermitePiBasis` (which carries the
Gaussian in the measure). Both are `EpsilonEridani.piHilbertBasis` over their respective one-dimensional
factor — here `EpsilonEridani.hermiteHilbertBasis` — so this file only performs the assembly.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.hermiteFunctionPiBasis` — the multi-index basis.
* `EpsilonEridani.hermiteFunctionPiBasis_apply` — the `a`-th vector is the tensor `EpsilonEridani.L2piMul` of the
  one-dimensional Hermite vectors, as an equality of `L²` vectors.
* `EpsilonEridani.coeFn_hermiteFunctionPiBasis` — the anti-vacuity pin: the `a`-th vector really is the
  product `∏ᵢ ψ_{aᵢ}(xᵢ)`.

between `L²` vectors it is what the expansion API rewrites with, since the inner product against a
