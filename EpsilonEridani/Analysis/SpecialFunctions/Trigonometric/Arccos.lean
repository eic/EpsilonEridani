# Comparing an angle with an arccosine

Mathlib's `Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Trigonometric/Inverse.lean` carries a complete comparison
family for `Real.arcsin` — `Real.arcsin_le_iff_le_sin`, `Real.le_arcsin_iff_sin_le`,
`Real.arcsin_lt_iff_lt_sin`, `Real.lt_arcsin_iff_sin_lt` and their primed variants — turning an
inequality between an angle and an `arcsin` into one between a real number and a `sin`. It carries
no counterpart for `Real.arccos`: the pinned Mathlib knows `Real.arccos_le_arccos`,
`Real.arccos_lt_arccos` and `Real.cos_arccos`, but nothing that compares an *angle* with an
arccosine.

This file supplies that family, and reads it off as a description of the sublevel and superlevel
sets of `Real.cos` on one period. Since `arccos` is antitone, the comparisons swap sides:
`arccos x ≤ y ↔ cos y ≤ x` where the `arcsin` family has `arcsin x ≤ y ↔ x ≤ sin y`.

## Main results

* `Real.arccos_le_iff_cos_le`, `Real.le_arccos_iff_le_cos`, `Real.arccos_lt_iff_cos_lt` and
  `Real.lt_arccos_iff_lt_cos` — the four comparisons on the closed domain, for `x` in `[-1, 1]` and
  an angle `y` in `[0, π]`.
* `Real.arccos_le_iff_cos_le'`, `Real.le_arccos_iff_le_cos'`, `Real.arccos_lt_iff_cos_lt'` and
  `Real.lt_arccos_iff_lt_cos'` — the same four with nothing at all assumed of `x`. Exactly as for
  Mathlib's primed `arcsin` lemmas, the degenerate values `x < -1` and `1 < x`, where `arccos` is
  constant, are covered at the price of excluding the one endpoint of `[0, π]` at which the
  comparison would then fail.
* `Real.abs_lt_arccos_iff_lt_cos` and `Real.abs_le_arccos_iff_le_cos` — since `cos` is even, an
  angle `t` of the full period `[-π, π]` may be compared through `|t|`; here the excluded endpoint
  is paid for by a one-sided bound on `x` instead.
* `Real.lt_cos_iff_mem_Ioo` and `Real.le_cos_iff_mem_Icc` — the same statements read as
  `{t ∈ [-π, π] | x < cos t} = (-arccos x, arccos x)` and its closed companion: on one period
  centred at `0`, the angles at which `cos` exceeds a threshold form the symmetric interval of
  half-width `arccos x`.
* `Real.lt_cos_of_mem_Icc` — the unimodality corollary: `cos` has no interior minimum on `[-π, π]`,
  so a strict lower bound holding at both ends of a subinterval holds throughout it.

## The argument

The closed-domain family is `Real.arccos_eq_pi_div_two_sub_arcsin` fed into Mathlib's `arcsin`
family, followed by `Real.sin_pi_div_two_sub`; each primed form is then its unprimed form together
with the two degenerate ranges of `x`, and the strict comparisons are negations of the weak ones —
exactly the shape, and the same order of derivation, that the `arcsin` family has. The `|t|` forms
split off the single degenerate angle that the half-period statement does not reach, and the
interval forms are `abs_lt` and `abs_le`.

This is general real analysis, extracted from two places that had proved fragments of it privately:
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Crosscut/Endpoints.lean`, which described a circular crosscut of
a disc as an angular arc of half-width `arccos (ρ / (2 * r))`, and
`EpsilonEridani/Topology/Circle/Metric.lean`, which needed the unimodality corollary to see that a circle
meets a disc in a connected set of angles. Both belong to layer **L5** of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`, the Jordan-domain case of the Carathéodory boundary
correspondence, but neither statement mentions a holomorphic map, a disc, or even the plane.

Because `Real.cos` is even, `Real.lt_arccos_iff_lt_cos'` extends from `[0, π]` to `[-π, π]` read
through `|t|`. The angle is now allowed to reach `π`, at the cost of the hypothesis `-1 ≤ x`, which
is what makes the two sides agree there: both are false. -/

This is `Real.lt_cos_iff_mem_Ioo` read as unimodality: below `-1` the bound is vacuous, and above it
