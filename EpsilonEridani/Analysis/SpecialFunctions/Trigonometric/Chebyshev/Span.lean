# Polynomial span of the Chebyshev modes

This file connects the algebraic Chebyshev basis of `ℝ[X]` with the normalized Chebyshev
functions in `L²(Polynomial.Chebyshev.measureT)`.  Evaluation followed by the canonical map into
`L²` is bundled as a linear map.  Since every Chebyshev polynomial is a nonzero scalar multiple
of its normalized mode, every polynomial evaluation belongs to the linear span of those modes.

This is the algebra-to-analysis handoff in Part C of the `OrthogonalL2Bases` roadmap.  In the
completeness argument, it upgrades orthogonality against every Chebyshev mode to orthogonality
against every polynomial.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.polynomialEvalChebyshevLp`: polynomial evaluation, cast into any `[RCLike 𝕜]` scalar
  field, as a linear map into `L²(Polynomial.Chebyshev.measureT)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.polynomialEvalChebyshevLp_mem_span`: every polynomial evaluation lies in the span of
  the normalized Chebyshev modes.
* `EpsilonEridani.inner_polynomialEvalChebyshevLp_eq_zero`: orthogonality to all normalized modes implies
  orthogonality to every polynomial evaluation.
* `EpsilonEridani.inner_polynomialEvalChebyshevLp`: the inner product against a polynomial evaluation is
  the corresponding polynomial moment `∫ x, g x * q.eval x ∂measureT`.
* `EpsilonEridani.integral_polynomialEval_measureT_eq_zero`: orthogonality to all normalized modes makes
  every polynomial moment vanish.

The measure- and scalar-generic bundling of polynomial evaluation lives in
`EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.Function.PolynomialMemLp` as `polynomialEvalLp`; `polynomialEvalChebyshevLp`
is its Chebyshev specialization.
