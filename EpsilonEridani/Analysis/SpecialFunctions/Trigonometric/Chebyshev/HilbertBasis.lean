# The Chebyshev `T` polynomials as a Hilbert basis of `L²(measureT)`

Roadmap **Part C**: the normalized Chebyshev `T` modes `Tₙ/√‖Tₙ‖²` are a Hilbert basis of
`L²([-1,1]; measureT)`, where `measureT` is Mathlib's Chebyshev orthogonality measure (weight
`(1-x²)^{-1/2}`).

Every input is already merged; this file only supplies the missing assembly. Orthonormality is
`EpsilonEridani.orthonormal_normalizedChebyshevTLp`; completeness is the one step that had been left open,
because it needs the **function-level** moment-determinacy theorem
`EpsilonEridani.ae_eq_zero_of_forall_moment_eq_zero_of_exists_integrable_exp` (a vector of `L²(measureT)`
orthogonal to every monomial is a.e. `0`). That theorem asks only for a *single* positive rate `a`
with `e^{a|x|}` integrable, which is free here: the Chebyshev measure has compact support `[-1,1]`,
so `e^{|x|}` is integrable against it and `a = 1` works.

The bridge from mode-orthogonality to monomial-orthogonality is
`EpsilonEridani.inner_polynomialEvalChebyshevLp_eq_zero`.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.chebyshevTHilbertBasis` — the Chebyshev `T` Hilbert basis of `L²(measureT)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.coe_chebyshevTHilbertBasis` — the anti-vacuity pin: the `n`-th basis vector is the
  normalized mode `Tₙ/√‖Tₙ‖²`.

/-- **Monomial-orthogonality from mode-orthogonality.** A vector of `L²(measureT)` orthogonal to
every normalized Chebyshev mode has every scalar-cast monomial moment `∫ (x : 𝕜)ⁿ · g` vanishing.
This threads `inner_polynomialEvalChebyshevLp_eq_zero` (orthogonality to every polynomial
evaluation) through the `L²` inner product at `q = Xⁿ`. -/

Orthonormality is `orthonormal_normalizedChebyshevTLp`; completeness is
`orthogonal_span_normalizedChebyshevTLp_eq_bot`, which is where the shipped Chebyshev groundwork had
stopped, one step short of the function-level moment-determinacy theorem. -/
