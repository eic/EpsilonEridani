# Polynomial moments for the Chebyshev `T` measure

This file records bare-polynomial moment, `L¹`, and `L²` consequences of compact support for
Mathlib's Chebyshev orthogonality measure `Polynomial.Chebyshev.measureT`.

The normalized Chebyshev modes and their orthonormality live in
`EpsilonEridani.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Trigonometric.Chebyshev.Measure`.  The lemmas here are the
un-normalized consumer forms needed on the way to the roadmap's Chebyshev Hilbert-basis target:
every real polynomial moment is finite, every real polynomial evaluation is integrable and square
integrable, and these statements are available after casting real-valued functions to any
`[RCLike 𝕜]` scalar field.

The map is well-defined because every polynomial has finite second moment for the Chebyshev
