# The two Chebyshev normalizations are images of one another

The `OrthogonalL2Bases` roadmap ships each orthogonal family in two normalizations: the bare
polynomials as a basis of the *weighted measure*, and their `√w`-envelopes as a basis of the
*reference measure*. For Chebyshev these are `EpsilonEridani.chebyshevTHilbertBasis` on
`Polynomial.Chebyshev.measureT` and `EpsilonEridani.chebyshevTEnvelopeHilbertBasis` on
`volume.restrict (Set.Ioc (-1) 1)`. Both were assembled separately from the same bridge; nothing so
far said they are the *same* basis seen through the weight-change isometry.

This file says it. The Gaussian instance of the same statement
(`EpsilonEridani.weightL2Isometry_gaussianHermiteHilbertBasis`) has to carry the dilation `u = x√2`,
because the Hermite functions are built on a rescaled argument; the Chebyshev `Tₙ` are not, so here
the identification is exact and can be stated at the level of bases rather than of individual
vectors.

The one thing standing in the way was that `Polynomial.Chebyshev.measureT` is not reducible outside
the module defining it, so the identity `measureT = w · (volume|_{(-1,1]})` was not available and
`EpsilonEridani.weightL2Isometry` could not be pointed at it. That identity is
`EpsilonEridani.chebyshevMeasureT_eq_withDensity`, recorded with the rest of the Chebyshev measure API in
`EpsilonEridani.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Trigonometric.Chebyshev.Measure`.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.chebyshevWeightL2Isometry` — the resulting isometry
  `L²(measureT) ≃ₗᵢ[𝕜] L²((-1, 1]; dx)`, multiplication by `√w`.
* `EpsilonEridani.chebyshevWeightL2Isometry_normalizedChebyshevTLp` — it carries the normalized mode
  `Tₙ/√cₙ` to the envelope function `τₙ`, with no dilation and no change of normalization.
* `EpsilonEridani.chebyshevTHilbertBasis_mapₗᵢ` and
  `EpsilonEridani.chebyshevTEnvelopeHilbertBasis_mapₗᵢ_symm` — the two named Chebyshev Hilbert bases are
  `HilbertBasis.mapₗᵢ`-images of one another under that isometry.
* `EpsilonEridani.repr_chebyshevWeightL2Isometry` — hence a function and its `√w`-envelope have
  the *same* Chebyshev coefficients, so a Chebyshev expansion may be computed in whichever
  normalization is convenient.

/-- **The Chebyshev weight-change isometry** `L²(measureT) ≃ₗᵢ[𝕜] L²((-1, 1]; dx)`: multiplication
by `√w = (1-x²)^{-1/4}`.

This is `EpsilonEridani.weightL2Isometry` at `μ = volume.restrict (Set.Ioc (-1) 1)` and
`w x = (1-x²)^{-1/2}`, precomposed with the transport of `L²(measureT)` along
`EpsilonEridani.chebyshevMeasureT_eq_withDensity`. It is an equivalence, rather than merely an isometric
embedding, because the weight is almost everywhere positive on `(-1, 1]`. -/

/-! ## The two bases -/

/-- **The isometry carries the normalized Chebyshev mode to the envelope function.**
`√w · (Tₙ/√cₙ) = τₙ`: the weight moves from the measure into the function, and nothing else
changes — no dilation of the argument and no change of normalizing constant. -/

  rw [hiso, hmode, henv, Algebra.smul_def, ← map_mul, chebyshevTEnvelope_def, mul_comm]

/-- **The two Chebyshev bases are the same basis in two normalizations.** Transporting the
bare-polynomial basis of `L²(measureT)` across the weight-change isometry gives exactly the envelope
basis of `L²((-1, 1]; dx)`.

This is the Chebyshev instance of the roadmap's claim that a family's weighted-measure and
`√w`-envelope bases are `HilbertBasis.mapₗᵢ`-images of one another; unlike the Gaussian instance it
needs no dilation, so it is an equality of bases rather than of individual vectors up to a change of
variables. -/

/-! ## Consequences for coefficients -/

/-- **A function and its `√w`-envelope have the same Chebyshev coefficients.** The coordinates of
`√w · f` in the envelope basis of `L²((-1, 1]; dx)` are the coordinates of `f` in the
bare-polynomial basis of `L²(measureT)`, so a Chebyshev expansion may be computed in whichever
normalization is convenient. -/

    LinearIsometryEquiv.trans_apply, LinearIsometryEquiv.symm_apply_apply]

/-- The individual coefficient form of `EpsilonEridani.repr_chebyshevWeightL2Isometry`: pairing
the envelope function `τₙ` against `√w · f` in `L²(dx)` is pairing the normalized mode `Tₙ/√cₙ`
against `f` in `L²(measureT)`. -/
