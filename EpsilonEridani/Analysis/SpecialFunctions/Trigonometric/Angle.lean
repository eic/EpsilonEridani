# Normalising a real angle into `[0, 2π)`

`Real.Angle` is `ℝ` modulo `2π`, and `toIcoMod Real.two_pi_pos 0` is the section of the quotient
map picking the representative in `[0, 2π)`. Mathlib records one direction of the relationship
between the two, as `Real.Angle.coe_toIcoMod`: normalising and then projecting to `Real.Angle`
changes nothing.

This file records that the section is *injective on angles* — the normalisations of two reals
agree exactly when the reals agree in `Real.Angle`. That is the transport step behind any
computation of a normalised angle: the identity is proved in `Real.Angle`, where `2π` is
invisible, and then read back as an equality of representatives.

## Main results

* `Real.Angle.toIcoMod_eq_toIcoMod_iff_coe_eq`: two reals have the same `[0, 2π)` representative
  exactly when they are equal in `Real.Angle`.

/-- **Equal angles are exactly equal normalisations.** Two reals agree in `Real.Angle` — that is,
differ by an integer multiple of `2π` — exactly when their representatives in `[0, 2π)` agree,
since the normalisation discards precisely such a multiple.

The forward direction is Mathlib's `Real.Angle.coe_toIcoMod` applied on both sides; the reverse
shifts one argument by the multiple and uses `toIcoMod_add_zsmul`. -/
