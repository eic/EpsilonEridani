# Measurability of the real Gamma function

`Real.Gamma` is smooth away from the nonpositive integers and has a pole at each of them, so it is
neither continuous nor locally bounded on all of `ℝ`. It is nevertheless Borel measurable, because
the set of its singularities is countable.

Mathlib records the analytic side of this (`Real.differentiableAt_Gamma`,
`Real.not_continuousAt_Gamma_neg_nat`) but never draws the measurability conclusion. It is needed
as soon as a formula containing `Real.Gamma s` is integrated or measured *in the variable `s`* —
for instance for the normalizing constants of the Gamma and Beta densities, which is why their
family-specific measurability modules use this result.

## Main results

* `Real.measurable_Gamma` — `Real.Gamma` is measurable.
