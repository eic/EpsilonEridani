# Continuity of pointwise PDE energy integrands in the coefficients

The finite-dimensional weak-form integrand
`energyIntegrand A b c` is linear in the principal, drift, and mass coefficients.  This file
bundles that linearity as continuous linear maps from coefficient spaces to spaces of
continuous bilinear maps.

This is a pointwise prerequisite for Lane D of the PDE roadmap.  Once the weak energy form is
defined by integrating `x ↦ energyIntegrand (a x) (b x) (c x)` over a domain, continuous
coefficient fields and continuous perturbation families should give continuous integrand
families without unfolding the jet form.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.PDE.energyIntegrandLinear`: the full coefficient triple-to-integrand map as a
  continuous linear map.
* `EpsilonEridani.PDE.continuous_energyIntegrand`: continuity of the unbundled full integrand map.
* `Continuous.energyIntegrand` and `ContinuousOn.energyIntegrand`: composition lemmas for
  coefficient fields.
