# Measurability of pointwise PDE energy integrands

The weak-form lane of the PDE roadmap is stated for bounded measurable coefficients.  Before the
pointwise jet integrand
`x ↦ energyIntegrand (a x) (b x) (c x)` can be integrated over a domain, it must be available as a
strongly measurable field of continuous bilinear forms, and its scalar evaluations on measurable
jet fields must be a.e. strongly measurable.

This file supplies that finite-dimensional bookkeeping.  It does not introduce a bundled
bounded-measurable-coefficient predicate; coefficient regularity remains stated inline,
following the roadmap and Mathlib style.

## Main declarations

* `stronglyMeasurable_energyIntegrand` and `aestronglyMeasurable_energyIntegrand`: measurable
  coefficient fields give a measurable field of pointwise energy integrands.
* `stronglyMeasurable_energyIntegrand_apply`, `stronglyMeasurable_energyIntegrand_apply₂`,
  `aestronglyMeasurable_energyIntegrand_apply`, and
  `aestronglyMeasurable_energyIntegrand_apply₂`: scalar evaluations on fixed or measurable jet
  fields are measurable.
