# Symmetric pointwise energy integrands

For a divergence-form operator with no drift term, a symmetric principal coefficient
matrix gives a symmetric pointwise jet bilinear form `energyIntegrand A 0 c`.  This file
records that finite-dimensional bookkeeping before the energy form is integrated over a
Sobolev space.

The main use is Lane D of the PDE roadmap: the weak formulation and the Dirichlet spectrum
need the integrated form coming from symmetric coefficients to be a symmetric coercive
bilinear form.  The already-existing `coefficientSymmetricPart` replaces a possibly
nonsymmetric coefficient matrix by `(A + Aᵀ) / 2`; here we prove the corresponding facts for
the full zero-drift jet integrand.

The quantitative diagonal lower bounds are supplied separately by
`EpsilonEridani.Analysis.PDE.EnergyLowerBounds` and its `UniformlyEllipticOn` wrappers.  In the
zero-drift case with positive mass and a principal quadratic lower bound, combine
`energyIntegrand_zero_drift_flip_eq_of_isSymm` or
`energyIntegrand_coefficientSymmetricPart_zero_drift_flip_eq` with
`min_lam_mass_mul_norm_sq_le_energyIntegrand_zero_drift_self` rather than introducing a
separate conjunction API.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.PDE.energyIntegrand_zero_drift_transpose_apply`: transposing the principal
  coefficient swaps the two jet arguments.
* `EpsilonEridani.PDE.energyIntegrand_zero_drift_comm_of_isSymm`: a symmetric principal
  coefficient gives a symmetric zero-drift jet form.
* `EpsilonEridani.PDE.energyIntegrand_coefficientSymmetricPart_zero_drift_apply`: the symmetric
  part has zero-drift jet form equal to the average of the original form and its transpose.
* `EpsilonEridani.PDE.energyIntegrand_coefficientSymmetricPart_self`: the diagonal energy density
  is unchanged by replacing the principal coefficient by its symmetric part.

Downstream energy forms that need the same integrand to be both symmetric and bounded below
pair this with `min_lam_mass_mul_norm_sq_le_energyIntegrand_zero_drift_self`.  For a
nonsymmetric principal coefficient, first pass to `coefficientSymmetricPart` using the uniform
ellipticity API in `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.PDE.Ellipticity.Basic`, then apply this lemma to the
symmetric coefficient field. -/
