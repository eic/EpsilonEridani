# Stone's theorem for unbounded self-adjoint operators

A self-adjoint operator `A` on a complex Hilbert space is `-i` times the complex generator of
exactly one unitary C₀-group, the group `e^{itA}`.  This completes the converse direction of
Stone's theorem, begun for bounded `A` in `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.Semigroups.Group.Stone.Basic`.
Together with the skew-adjointness of the generator of a unitary group
(`EpsilonEridani.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousGroup.IsUnitary.complexGenerator_adjoint_eq_neg`) this
characterizes the self-adjoint operators as the operators `A` with `i • A` the complex
generator of a unitary group.

The construction is the classical one.  The real restrictions of `i • A` and `-i • A` are
m-dissipative (`IsSelfAdjoint.isMDissipative_smul_restrictScalars` at `c = ± i`), so by
Lumer--Phillips each generates a contraction semigroup.  Their generators are negatives of one
another, so their equal-time operators are mutually inverse and the two semigroups glue into a
C₀-group (`EpsilonEridani.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousSemigroup.toGroupOfInverse`, the inverse hypotheses
being `StronglyContinuousSemigroup.comp_eq_id_of_generator_eq_neg` and its primed variant).  The
glued group is complex linear because its forward half is (the generator of that half is the real
restriction of a complex-linear partial map), and unitary because it contracts in both time
directions.  Its complex generator is `i • A`, and a unitary group is determined by its complex
generator.

## Main results

* `IsSelfAdjoint.existsUnique_isUnitary_complexGenerator_eq_I_smul`: **Stone's theorem, converse
  direction**: a self-adjoint operator `A` has exactly one unitary C₀-group with complex
  generator `i • A`.
* `LinearPMap.isSelfAdjoint_iff_exists_isUnitary_complexGenerator_eq_I_smul` is **Stone's
  theorem** as a characterization of self-adjoint operators.
