# Linear flows from strongly continuous groups

A strongly continuous one-parameter group of bounded linear operators acts continuously on its
underlying normed space, and hence determines a `Flow`. This file supplies that bridge between the
operator-valued semigroup API and the point-valued dynamical API.

The construction forgets only linear structure: its time maps are the operators of the group.
Consequently it commutes with time reversal, and its orbits are definitionally the group orbits.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousGroup.toFlow`: the flow underlying a strongly continuous
  group.
* `EpsilonEridani.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousGroup.toFlow_reflect`: time reversal commutes with passage
  to the underlying flow.
