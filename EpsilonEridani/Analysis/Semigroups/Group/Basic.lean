# Strongly continuous one-parameter groups

A **C₀-group** on a real normed space `X` is a family `U : ℝ → X →L[ℝ] X` indexed by *all* of `ℝ`
with `U 0 = 1`, `U (s + t) = U s ∘ U t`, and `t ↦ U t x` continuous at `0`. It is not reached by
the C₀-semigroup API: the two-sided law makes every `U t` invertible, with inverse `U (-t)`, and
forces the orbits to be continuous on the whole line rather than only on `[0, ∞)`. The unitary
group `e^{itH}` of a Schrödinger evolution is the motivating example.

This file sets up the object and the two ways of viewing it through the existing
`StronglyContinuousSemigroup` theory:

* the **forward semigroup** `U.toSemigroup`, the restriction of `U` to `[0, ∞)`;
* the **time reversal** `U.reflect`, the C₀-group `t ↦ U (-t)`, whose forward semigroup is the
  backward half of `U`.

The growth bound is obtained by applying semigroup results to both halves. The generator API in
`EpsilonEridani.Analysis.Semigroups.Group.Generator`, including generator uniqueness, similarly uses
`U.reflect` for the backward half.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousGroup`: the C₀-group structure.
* `EpsilonEridani.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousGroup.toContinuousLinearEquiv`: `U t` as a continuous
  linear equivalence, with inverse `U (-t)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousGroup.reflect`: the time-reversed group `t ↦ U (-t)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousGroup.toSemigroup`: the forward C₀-semigroup.
* `EpsilonEridani.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousGroup.HasGrowthBound`: the two-sided growth bound
  `‖U t‖ ≤ M * exp (ω * |t|)`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousGroup.continuous_orbit`: the orbits of a C₀-group are
  continuous on all of `ℝ`, not merely at `0`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousGroup.existsGrowthBound`: every C₀-group has a finite
  two-sided exponential growth bound.
* `EpsilonEridani.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousGroup.isometry_of_forall_norm_le_one`: a C₀-group that
  contracts in both time directions is a group of isometries.
* `EpsilonEridani.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousGroup.tendsto_apply`: joint strong continuity
  `U (f i) (g i) → U r z`, at every real time and without a sign restriction.
