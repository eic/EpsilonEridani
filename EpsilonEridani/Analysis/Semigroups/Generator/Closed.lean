# Closedness of semigroup generators

This file proves that the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup on a real
Banach space is a closed `LinearPMap`. The proof uses the Laplace-transform resolvent: for any
parameter above a growth exponent, the generator graph is the equalizer

`R(lambda) (lambda x - y) = x`.

The forward implication is the resolvent left-inverse identity on the generator domain. The
reverse implication uses that the resolvent maps into the domain and is a right inverse to
`lambda I - A`. Since the resolvent is bounded, the equalizer is closed.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousSemigroup.mem_generator_graph_iff_resolvent_eq`:
  membership in the generator graph is characterized by one resolvent equation.
* `EpsilonEridani.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousSemigroup.isClosed_generator`: the generator of every
  strongly continuous semigroup is closed.

/-- A pair `(x, y)` belongs to the graph of the generator precisely when applying an admissible
resolvent to `lambda x - y` recovers `x`.

This characterization presents the graph as the equalizer of two continuous maps and is also a
convenient elimination rule when a resolvent equation is easier to establish than domain
membership directly. -/
