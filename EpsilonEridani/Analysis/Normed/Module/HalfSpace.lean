# Strict half-spaces of a real normed space are unbounded

A strict half-space `{y | φ y < u}` cut out by a nonzero linear functional holds points of
arbitrarily large norm, and is therefore unbounded. Linearity alone suffices: `φ` need not be
continuous, so the results apply to a discontinuous functional on an infinite-dimensional space.
For such a `φ` the set need not be topologically open, which is why it is called strict rather
than open here.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_apply_lt_and_lt_norm` and `EpsilonEridani.exists_lt_apply_and_lt_norm` — either side
  of a nonzero linear functional holds points of arbitrarily large norm.
* `EpsilonEridani.not_isBounded_halfSpace_lt` and `EpsilonEridani.not_isBounded_halfSpace_gt` — either strict
  half-space is unbounded.
