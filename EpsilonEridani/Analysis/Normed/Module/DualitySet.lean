# The duality set of a vector in a normed space

For a vector `x` of a normed space `E` over `𝕜 = ℝ` or `ℂ`, the **(normalized) duality set**

`J(x) = {x' ∈ E' | x' x = ‖x‖² ∧ ‖x'‖ = ‖x‖}`

collects the continuous linear functionals that realize the norm of `x` in the sharpest possible
way. The set-valued map `x ↦ J(x)` is the *duality map* of `E`. On a Hilbert space `J(x)` is the
singleton `{⟪x, ·⟫}`, and in general it is the tool through which inner-product arguments
(`⟪A x, x⟫ ≤ 0`, say) are transported to Banach spaces; the main consumer is the duality-map
characterization of dissipative operators in semigroup theory.

The Hahn--Banach theorem makes every `J(x)` nonempty (`dualitySet_nonempty`), and the norm
condition can be weakened to an inequality (`mem_dualitySet_iff_norm_le`), which is how members
are usually produced: rescale a norming functional of norm at most one (`smul_mem_dualitySet`).
