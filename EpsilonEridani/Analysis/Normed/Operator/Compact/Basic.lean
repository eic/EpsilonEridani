# Compact operators and bounded sequences

This file records sequential consequences of compactness for bounded sequences in normed spaces.

## Main declarations

* `IsCompactOperator.exists_subseq_tendsto`: a compact operator sends a bounded sequence
  to a sequence with a convergent subsequence.
* `IsCompactOperator.exists_dist_lt_of_norm_le`: a compact operator cannot keep the
  images of a bounded sequence pairwise separated.
