# The kernel of an operator paired with a complementary coordinate

A continuous linear map `A : M →L[R] F` together with a second map `q : M →L[R] G` describes `M`
by "the value of `A`" and "the remaining coordinate `q`" exactly when the pair
`A.prod q : M →L[R] F × G` is invertible. That is the situation the implicit function theorem
creates: there `A` is the derivative of the equation and `q` is a projection onto a complement of
its kernel.

In that situation the second coordinate restricts to an isomorphism from `ker A` onto `G`. This
file constructs its inverse, `ContinuousLinearMap.kerSection`, which sends `v : G` to the unique
`x : M` with `A x = 0` and `q x = v`, and packages it as
`ContinuousLinearMap.kerEquivOfProd : G ≃L[R] ↥A.ker`. The kernel of `A` is therefore described by
a continuous linear parametrization whose parameter space does not depend on the point at which
`A` is taken, which is what lets a moving kernel — a tangent space along a level set — be compared
with a fixed model space.

Invertibility of the pair is recorded through `ContinuousLinearMap.IsInvertible`, so that the
section is a plain definition and the hypothesis appears only in the lemmas about it; the
underlying inverse is Mathlib's total `ContinuousLinearMap.inverse`.

## Main declarations

* `ContinuousLinearMap.kerSection`: the section `G →L[R] M` of `q` with values in `ker A`.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.eq_kerSection`: it is the only map with that defining property.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.range_kerSection`: its range is exactly `ker A`.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.kerEquivOfProd`: the resulting isomorphism `G ≃L[R] ↥A.ker`.

/-- The section of `q` with values in the kernel of `A`: it sends `v : G` to the unique `x : M`
with `A x = 0` and `q x = v`.

This is meaningful when the pair `A.prod q` is invertible, which every lemma below assumes;
outside that case Mathlib's `ContinuousLinearMap.inverse` returns `0` and so does this map. -/
