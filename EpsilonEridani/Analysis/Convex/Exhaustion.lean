# Exhausting a convex open set from inside

A convex open subset `Ω` of a *proper* real normed space — a finite-dimensional one, say — is the
increasing union of convex open subsets whose closures are compact subsets of `Ω`.  Intersecting
the homothetic copies `c + t • (Ω - c)` about a point `c ∈ Ω`, for `0 < t < 1`, with expanding
balls gives the subsets: convexity keeps their closures inside `Ω`, the balls make them bounded,
and properness makes their closures compact.  Properness cannot be dropped: in an
infinite-dimensional normed space the unit ball is exhausted by no sequence of relatively compact
open subsets.

Convexity of the pieces is the point of the construction.  A general open set is exhausted by the
relatively compact open sets `{x | dist x Ωᶜ > 1 / n} ∩ ball 0 n`, but those are not convex, and an
estimate whose constant depends on convexity of the domain — a Poincaré-type inequality, say —
cannot be transported along them.

/-- **A convex open set is exhausted from inside by convex open sets.**  In a proper real normed
space, if `Ω` is open and convex, there is an increasing sequence of convex open sets `U n` whose
closures are compact subsets of `Ω` and whose union is `Ω`. -/
