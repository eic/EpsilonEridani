# Pointwise limits of completely monotone functions

Complete monotonicity on `(0, ∞)` is stable under pointwise convergence: no uniformity, no
equicontinuity, and no smoothness of the limit need be assumed.  This file proves that closure
property, completing the algebraic ones of
`EpsilonEridani.Analysis.CompletelyMonotone.OpenClosure`.

The derivative form of the predicate is not visibly stable under pointwise limits — nothing says
that the derivatives converge — so the proof passes through the finite-difference form
`EpsilonEridani.IsDifferenceCompletelyMonotone`, which is manifestly stable
(`EpsilonEridani.isDifferenceCompletelyMonotone_of_tendsto`), and comes back through the representation
theorem of `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.CompletelyMonotone.FiniteDifference.Laplace`.  That return trip needs
the limit to be right-continuous at the left endpoint of the half-line it is stated on, and this
is where the convexity of a completely monotone function is used: a pointwise limit of convex
functions is convex, hence continuous on the *open* half-line, so every positive translate of the
limit is right-continuous at `0`.  That convexity is
`EpsilonEridani.IsCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi.convexOn`.

The open half-line is not a defect of the proof.  Complete monotonicity on the closed half-line is
genuinely *not* closed under pointwise limits: the functions `t ↦ (1 + n t)⁻¹` are completely
monotone on `[0, ∞)` and converge pointwise to the indicator of `{0}`, which is not even
continuous.  What survives at the endpoint is exactly one extra hypothesis, right-continuity at
`0`, and with it `EpsilonEridani.IsContinuousCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi` is closed under pointwise limits
too.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.isCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_of_tendsto`: **complete monotonicity on `(0, ∞)` is closed
  under pointwise limits.**
* `EpsilonEridani.isContinuousCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_of_tendsto`: the closed-half-line predicate is
  closed under pointwise limits of functions completely monotone on `(0, ∞)`, given
  right-continuity of the limit at `0`.

/-- **Complete monotonicity on `(0, ∞)` is closed under pointwise limits.**  A pointwise limit of
functions completely monotone on `(0, ∞)` is completely monotone on `(0, ∞)`; in particular it is
automatically `C^∞` there.

Nothing is assumed about the limit, and no uniformity is assumed about the convergence.  The
closed half-line version is false, see the module docstring, and
`EpsilonEridani.isContinuousCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_of_tendsto` for what replaces it. -/
