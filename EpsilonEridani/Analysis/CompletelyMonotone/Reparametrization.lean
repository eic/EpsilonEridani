# Complete monotonicity is closed under nonnegative affine reparametrization

This file extends the closure API of `EpsilonEridani.IsCompletelyMonotone` (sums, nonnegative scalar
multiples, products and differentiation, in `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.CompletelyMonotone.Basic` and
`EpsilonEridani.Analysis.CompletelyMonotone.Closure`) with closure under **reparametrizing the
argument by a nonnegative affine map** `t ↦ c · t + a` (`c, a ≥ 0`), as called for by the
`OneParameterSemigroups` roadmap's completely-monotone closure programme.

Both nonnegativity conditions are essential and are exactly what keeps the reparametrized
argument inside `[0, ∞)`, where the sign-alternation of `f` lives: scaling `t ↦ c · t` needs
`c ≥ 0` so that `c · t ≥ 0`, and it multiplies the `n`-th alternating derivative by the
nonnegative factor `cⁿ`; shifting `t ↦ t + a` needs `a ≥ 0` so that `t + a ≥ 0`, and it leaves
the alternating derivative unchanged, only evaluated further to the right. A negative scaling
`c < 0` reflects the half-line and turns complete monotonicity into absolute monotonicity, so
the sign condition genuinely fails; a negative shift `a < 0` samples `f` to the left of `0`,
where nothing is assumed.

The scaling step is a direct consequence of Mathlib's `iteratedDerivWithin_comp_const_smul`; the
shift step uses `iteratedDerivWithin_comp_add_const`, whose reparametrized set `a +ᵥ [0, ∞)` is
`[a, ∞)`, and there the alternating derivative of `f` agrees with its value within `[0, ∞)`
because `f` is smooth across the interior of the half-line. Combining the two gives the general
nonnegative affine reparametrization.

These closure lemmas manufacture new completely monotone functions from old: for instance
`t ↦ e^{-x (c t + a)}` is completely monotone whenever `x, c, a ≥ 0`, and every resolvent kernel
`t ↦ (λ + t)⁻¹` reparametrized by a nonnegative affine map stays completely monotone.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.IsCompletelyMonotone.comp_const_mul`: if `f` is completely monotone and `0 ≤ c`, then
  `t ↦ f (c · t)` is completely monotone.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsCompletelyMonotone.comp_add_const`: if `f` is completely monotone and `0 ≤ a`, then
  `t ↦ f (t + a)` is completely monotone.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsCompletelyMonotone.sub_comp_add_const`: if `f` is completely monotone and `0 ≤ a`,
  then `t ↦ f t - f (t + a)` is completely monotone.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsCompletelyMonotone.comp_affine`: if `f` is completely monotone and `0 ≤ c`, `0 ≤ a`,
  then `t ↦ f (c · t + a)` is completely monotone.
