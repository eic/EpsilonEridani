# Complete monotonicity in the finite-difference sense, from rational data

`EpsilonEridani.IsDifferenceCompletelyMonotone` quantifies over *all* lists of nonnegative real steps and
all nonnegative real base points. A construction that produces a candidate function as a countable
limit — for instance a fibrewise Radon--Nikodym density, which is only defined up to a null set —
can verify the sign condition on a countable set of data and no more. This file closes that gap:
for a function that is continuous from the right on `[0, ∞)`, the sign condition on **rational
lists at rational base points** already implies the full predicate
(`EpsilonEridani.isDifferenceCompletelyMonotone_of_forall_rat`).

No density argument in several variables is needed. The steps are freed one at a time, each one
costing a single one-variable limit: if every mixed difference of `f` along `l ++ m` alternates
whenever the extra step is rational, then the signed difference along `l ++ m` is nonincreasing
along rational increments, hence — being right-continuous — nonincreasing outright, which is the
sign condition for one further *real* step. The permutation invariance of a mixed difference
(`EpsilonEridani.fwdDiffList_eq_of_perm`) is what lets the new step be peeled off the front.

The right-continuity hypothesis is doing real work: rational data say nothing whatsoever about the
value of `f` at an irrational point, so lowering `f` there below zero leaves every rational datum
untouched while destroying the sign condition for the empty list of steps.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.tendsto_fwdDiffList_nhdsGT`: a mixed forward difference of a right-continuous function
  is right-continuous.
* `EpsilonEridani.isDifferenceCompletelyMonotone_of_forall_rat`: rational data suffice.

/-- **Rational data suffice for complete monotonicity in the finite-difference sense.** A function
that is continuous from the right at every point of `[0, ∞)` and whose mixed forward differences
along lists of nonnegative *rational* steps alternate at every nonnegative *rational* base point is
completely monotone in the finite-difference sense.

This is the form in which a fibrewise construction verifies the hypothesis of the
Hausdorff--Bernstein--Widder theorem: countably many almost-everywhere statements can be
intersected, whereas the uncountable family of conditions packaged in
`EpsilonEridani.IsDifferenceCompletelyMonotone` cannot. -/
