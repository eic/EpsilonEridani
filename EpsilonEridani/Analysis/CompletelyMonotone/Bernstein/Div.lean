# A Bernstein function divided by its parameter is completely monotone

If `f` is a Bernstein function, then `t ↦ f(t) / t` is completely monotone on `(0, ∞)`. This is
one of the standard correspondences between Bernstein and completely monotone functions, next to
`t ↦ e^{-x f(t)}` (`EpsilonEridani.IsBernsteinFunction.isContinuousCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_exp_neg_mul`)
and the primitive of a completely monotone function
(`EpsilonEridani.IsCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi.isBernsteinFunction_integral`). For a *complete* Bernstein
function the quotient is even a Stieltjes function
(`EpsilonEridani.IsCompleteBernsteinFunction.isStieltjesFunction_div`); for a general Bernstein function
complete monotonicity is the most one can say.

For a Bernstein function with `f(0) > 0`, continuity at zero makes the quotient unbounded near the
origin. Continuity of `f` at `0` is not needed for the general theorem, only its nonnegativity and
differentiability on `(0, ∞)` and the complete monotonicity of `f'` there, so the theorem is stated
under exactly those hypotheses and specialized to Bernstein functions afterwards.

The sign of `dⁿ/dtⁿ (f(t) / t)` is that of `(-1)ⁿ T(0)`, where `T` is the Taylor polynomial of
order `n` of `f` expanded at `t` (`EpsilonEridani.iteratedDeriv_div_id`). Since `(-1)ⁿ f⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾ ≥ 0`,
the Taylor remainder has a sign on every `[ε, t]` with `ε > 0`, giving `T(ε) ≥ f(ε) ≥ 0`
(`EpsilonEridani.le_taylorWithinEval_of_neg_one_pow_mul_iteratedDerivWithin_nonneg`), and `T(0) ≥ 0`
follows by letting `ε → 0`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.isCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_div_of_isCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_deriv`: if `f` is
  differentiable and nonnegative on `(0, ∞)` with completely monotone derivative there, then
  `t ↦ f(t) / t` is completely monotone on `(0, ∞)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsBernsteinFunction.isCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_div`: a Bernstein function divided by
  its parameter is completely monotone on `(0, ∞)`.
