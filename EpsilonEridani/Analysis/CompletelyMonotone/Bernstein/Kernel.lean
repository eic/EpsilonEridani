# Measurable Bernstein measures and their kernel form

The Hausdorff--Bernstein--Widder theorem and its basic representing-measure API live in
`EpsilonEridani.Analysis.CompletelyMonotone.Bernstein.HausdorffBernsteinWidder`. This file shows that
the Bernstein measure depends **measurably** on a parameter: a family `a ↦ f a` of completely
monotone functions whose values at the natural numbers are measurable in `a` has Bernstein
measures forming a `ProbabilityTheory.Kernel`.

Measurability is not a selection statement. The representing measure is unique, so the family
`a ↦ bernsteinMeasure (f a)` is already determined; what has to be proved is that this
particular family is measurable, and that is
`EpsilonEridani.measurable_of_measurable_laplaceTransform_natCast`, applied to the identity
`laplaceTransform (bernsteinMeasure (f a)) n = f a n`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.measurable_bernsteinMeasure`: measurable dependence on a parameter.
* `EpsilonEridani.bernsteinMeasureKernel`: the resulting kernel, with its finiteness criterion.

/-- **The Bernstein measure depends measurably on a parameter.** If every member of a family of
functions is continuous on `[0, ∞)` and completely monotone on `(0, ∞)`, and if the family is
measurable in the parameter at each natural number, then the family of Bernstein measures is
measurable for the Giry σ-algebra.

Only the values at natural numbers enter, because a finite measure on `ℝ≥0` is already determined
by its Laplace transform there. -/
