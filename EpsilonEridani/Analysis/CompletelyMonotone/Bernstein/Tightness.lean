# Tightness of the Chafaï approximating measures

This file proves the tightness input for the Prokhorov extraction step in Bernstein's theorem.
For a completely monotone function `f`, the rescaled Chafaï measures have uniformly bounded
first moment:

`∫⁻ p, p ∂(chafaiRescaled f n) ≤ -f'(0)`.

Markov's inequality therefore bounds their mass outside `[0, R]` by `-f'(0) / R`, uniformly in
`n`. Since the intervals `[0, R]` are compact in `ℝ≥0`, this proves that the whole family is
tight.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.chafaiRescaled_measure_Ioi_le`: the uniform first-moment tail bound.
* `EpsilonEridani.isTightMeasureSet_range_chafaiRescaled`: the rescaled Chafaï measures form a tight
  family.

complete monotonicity. -/
