# Bernstein's theorem: existence of a representing measure

A completely monotone function on `[0, ∞)` is the Laplace transform of a finite positive measure
on `ℝ≥0`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_representsLaplace_of_isCompletelyMonotone`

## Scope

This is the **existence** half of the Bernstein milestone in
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/OneParameterSemigroups/README.md`, Part B. Uniqueness of the representing measure
is `EpsilonEridani.RepresentsLaplace.unique`, the converse direction is
`EpsilonEridani.isContinuousCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_laplaceTransform`, and all three combine in
`Bernstein/HausdorffBernsteinWidder.lean` as `EpsilonEridani.hausdorff_bernstein_widder` and
`EpsilonEridani.hausdorff_bernstein_widder_existsUnique`.

Finiteness of the representing measure is not an extra hypothesis but a consequence of complete
monotonicity on the *closed* half-line: `IsCompletelyMonotone` builds in `Set.Ici 0`, so `f` takes a
real value at `0`, and the representing measure has total mass `f 0`. On the open half-line alone
the value at `0` need not exist and the representing measure can be infinite — `1/t` is completely
monotone on `(0, ∞)` with representing measure Lebesgue.

## Implementation

`Bernstein/Measures.lean` supplies the Chafaï approximating measures `chafaiRescaled f n` on `ℝ≥0`
and the reconstruction identity `f x - L = ∫ bernsteinKernel n x ∂(chafaiRescaled f n)`, where
`L = lim_{t→∞} f t`. Those measures are uniformly mass-bounded and, by `Bernstein/Tightness.lean`,
tight. The three remaining steps are:

1. extract a weak limit `μ₀` from tightness;
2. pass the reconstruction identity to that limit, replacing the Bernstein kernel by `e^{-xp}`,
   which represents the non-constant part `f - L`;
3. add the atom `L • δ₀`, whose Laplace transform is the constant `L`, to represent `f` itself.

Step 1 uses `finite_measure_cluster_limit` rather than its subsequence form
`finite_measure_subseq_limit`: the latter needs `FirstCountableTopology (FiniteMeasure ℝ≥0)`, and
Mathlib's metrizability instances for spaces of measures are stated for `ProbabilityMeasure`, not
`FiniteMeasure`. No subsequence is actually required — every ingredient is a filter limit, so an
ultrafilter below `atTop` suffices, and being `NeBot` it still gives uniqueness of limits.

/-- **The weak limit represents the non-constant part.** Along the ultrafilter `U`, the Chafaï
measures converge weakly to `μ₀`; passing the reconstruction identity to that limit replaces the
Bernstein kernel by `e^{-tp}` and exhibits `μ₀` as a representing measure for `f - L`, where `L` is
the limit of `f` at infinity. The atom carrying `L` itself is added by the caller.

Stated pointwise in `t`, which is how the caller consumes it. -/
