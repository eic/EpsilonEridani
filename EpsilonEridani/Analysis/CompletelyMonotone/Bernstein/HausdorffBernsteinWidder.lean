# Hausdorff--Bernstein--Widder theorem

This file proves the finite-measure form of the Hausdorff--Bernstein--Widder theorem for
completely monotone functions on the closed half-line: a function is continuous on `[0, ∞)`
and completely monotone on `(0, ∞)` if and only if it is the Laplace transform of a (unique)
finite positive measure on `ℝ≥0`.

The hard direction is a direct application of the finite-difference representation theorem in
`FiniteDifference/Laplace.lean`: derivative complete monotonicity implies the mixed-difference
condition, and continuity on `[0, ∞)` supplies right-continuity at zero. The easy direction and
uniqueness live in `Laplace/Representation.lean`.
