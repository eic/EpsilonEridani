# The Hausdorff--Bernstein--Widder theorem on the open half-line

A function completely monotone on the *open* half-line `(0, ∞)` is the Laplace transform of a
unique positive measure on `ℝ≥0`, and that measure need not be finite: the reciprocal
`t ↦ 1 / t` is completely monotone on `(0, ∞)` and is represented by Lebesgue measure. The
finite-measure statement, `EpsilonEridani.hausdorff_bernstein_widder`, is the strictly stronger
conclusion drawn from the strictly stronger hypothesis of continuity up to the boundary point
`0`; this file records what survives when that boundary hypothesis is dropped.

The representation predicate is `EpsilonEridani.RepresentsLaplaceOnIoi`, which replaces the finiteness
clause of `EpsilonEridani.RepresentsLaplace` by integrability of the exponential kernel at every
positive parameter -- exactly what makes the transform a genuine Bochner integral rather than the
junk value of a non-integrable one.

The proof is an exponential-tilt bookkeeping argument on top of Bernstein's theorem. For each
`a > 0` the shift `t ↦ f (t + a)` is completely monotone on the closed half-line, so it has a
finite representing measure `σ a`; the tilted measures `e^{a p} · σ a` are then all equal, and
their common value is the representing measure of `f` itself. Uniqueness runs the tilt backwards:
tilting by `e^{-p}` turns any representing measure into a finite one, where the Laplace transform
is already known to determine the measure.

## Main declarations

The positive shifts `t ↦ f (t + a)` are completely monotone on the closed half-line, so
