# Exponential measures as Bernstein representing measures

The exponential probability measure with rate `r > 0`, transported from `ℝ` to `ℝ≥0`, has
Laplace transform

`t ↦ r / (r + t)`.

This gives a continuous, non-atomic example of Bernstein's theorem: at unit rate the function
`t ↦ 1 / (1 + t)` is represented by the measure with density `e⁻ˣ` on `[0, ∞)`.  Unlike the
Dirac examples, this exercises a genuinely continuous representing measure.

The measure is defined in `EpsilonEridani.Probability.Distributions.Exponential.Basic` by pushing
Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.expMeasure` forward along `Real.toNNReal`.  A positive-rate
exponential random variable is nonnegative almost surely, so this transport retains the law and
turns its moment-generating-function formula into the required Laplace-transform formula.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.laplaceTransform_nnrealExpMeasure`: its Laplace transform is `r / (r + t)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.representsLaplace_nnrealExpMeasure`: the resulting Bernstein representation.
* `EpsilonEridani.bernsteinMeasure_one_div_one_add`: the canonical Bernstein measure of
  `t ↦ 1 / (1 + t)` is the unit-rate exponential measure.
