# Bernstein functions are the exponents of completely monotone semigroups

`EpsilonEridani.IsBernsteinFunction.isContinuousCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_exp_neg_mul` produces, from a
Bernstein function `f`, the completely monotone functions `t ↦ e^{-x f(t)}` for every `x ≥ 0` —
the Laplace transforms of the subprobability convolution semigroup subordinate to `f`.  This
file proves the converse, so that the two classes determine each other:

**`f` is a Bernstein function if and only if `f` is nonnegative on `[0, ∞)` and, for every
`x > 0`, `e^{-x f}` is continuous on `[0, ∞)` and completely monotone on `(0, ∞)`.**

This is the standard correspondence between the two classes, and the form in which Bernstein
functions enter probability theory: `e^{-x f}` completely monotone for all `x > 0` says exactly
that `f` is the Laplace exponent of a possibly killed subordinator, the killing rate being
`f 0`, which this library allows to be positive.

Quantifying over *all* `x > 0` is essential, and the proof shows why: differentiating
`t ↦ e^{-x f(t)}` gives the exact identity

`- x⁻¹ · (e^{-x f})'(t) = f'(t) · e^{-x f(t)}`,

so the left-hand side is completely monotone by
`EpsilonEridani.IsCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi.neg_deriv`, and letting `x ↓ 0` along `x = 1 / (n + 1)` makes
the right-hand side converge pointwise to `f'`.  Complete monotonicity survives that limit by
`EpsilonEridani.isCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_of_tendsto`, which is the whole content: a single `x` says far
less, since it constrains only one member of the family.

The remaining hypotheses of `EpsilonEridani.IsBernsteinFunction` are recovered from the exponentials
rather than assumed, through `EpsilonEridani.contDiffOn_of_contDiffOn_exp_const_mul`: smoothness of `f`
on `(0, ∞)` comes from that of `e^{-x f}`, and only right-continuity of `f` at `0` is left to
hypothesize, the rest of its continuity on `[0, ∞)` following from the smoothness.
Nonnegativity of `f` is genuinely independent — the constant `-1` has `e^{x}` for its
exponentials, and constants are completely monotone.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.isCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_deriv_mul_exp_neg_mul`: for `x > 0`, the function
  `t ↦ f'(t) · e^{-x f(t)}` is completely monotone on `(0, ∞)` whenever `e^{-x f}` is.
* `EpsilonEridani.isBernsteinFunction_of_forall_isCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_exp_neg_mul`: the converse
  direction, that the family of exponentials forces `f` to be a Bernstein function.
* `isBernsteinFunction_iff_nonneg_and_forall_isContinuousCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_exp_neg_mul`: the
  resulting characterization of Bernstein functions.

`(0, ∞)` for some `x > 0`, then so is `t ↦ f'(t) · e^{-x f(t)}`, because that function is
`-x⁻¹` times the derivative of `e^{-x f}`. -/

/-- **The exponentials of a Bernstein function determine it.**  If `f` is nonnegative on `[0, ∞)`,
right-continuous at `0`, and `e^{-x f}` is completely monotone on `(0, ∞)` for every `x > 0`,
then `f` is a Bernstein function.

This is the converse of
`EpsilonEridani.IsBernsteinFunction.isContinuousCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_exp_neg_mul`; smoothness of `f`
on `(0, ∞)` is not assumed, but deduced from the exponential at `x = 1`, and with it continuity
of `f` away from the endpoint. -/

/-- **The characterization of Bernstein functions by complete monotonicity of their
exponentials.**  A function is a Bernstein function exactly when it is nonnegative on `[0, ∞)` and
each `e^{-x f}`, `x > 0`, is completely monotone on `(0, ∞)` and continuous on `[0, ∞)`.

Continuity of `f` itself is not part of the right-hand side: it is recovered from continuity of
one exponential.  Nonnegativity is not: the constant `-1` satisfies every other clause. -/
