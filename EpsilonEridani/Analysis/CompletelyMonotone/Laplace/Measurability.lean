# Measurable families of finite measures on `ℝ≥0`

A finite measure on `ℝ≥0` is determined by its Laplace transform at the natural numbers
(`EpsilonEridani.Measure.ext_of_forall_laplaceTransform_natCast_eq`). This file upgrades that
determinacy statement to a *measurable* one: a family `a ↦ μ a` of finite measures on `ℝ≥0`
is measurable for the Giry σ-algebra as soon as each of the scalar functions
`a ↦ laplaceTransform (μ a) n`, `n : ℕ`, is measurable.

The proof uses the exponential change of variables `p ↦ e^{-p}`, which carries `ℝ≥0` into the
unit interval and turns the Laplace transform at `n` into the `n`-th moment. Weierstrass
approximation then makes `a ↦ ∫ g dμ a` measurable for every continuous `g` on the interval, the
outer approximation of a closed set by bounded continuous functions transfers this to
`a ↦ μ a F` for closed `F`, and the closed sets are a π-system generating the Borel σ-algebra.

Because a *unique* finite measure is attached to each parameter value, no measurable-selection
theorem is involved: the family is whatever it is, and the theorem merely certifies it
measurable. This is what turns a fibrewise Bernstein representation into a kernel, in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/CompletelyMonotone/Bernstein/Kernel.lean`.

## Main declarations
