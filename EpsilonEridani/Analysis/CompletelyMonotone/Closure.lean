# Closure of completely monotone functions under products and differentiation

This file extends the basic API of `EpsilonEridani.IsCompletelyMonotone` (sums and nonnegative scalar
multiples, in `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.CompletelyMonotone.Basic`) with two further closure properties
called for by the `OneParameterSemigroups` roadmap:

* the **product** of two completely monotone functions is completely monotone, hence so is any
  finite product and any natural power;
* if `f` is completely monotone then so is `t ↦ -f'(t)`, the **negated derivative**.

Both are elementary consequences of the sign-alternation definition. For the product, the
Leibniz rule expands `(-1)ⁿ (fg)⁽ⁿ⁾` as a nonnegative combination
`∑ₖ (n choose k) · [(-1)ᵏ f⁽ᵏ⁾] · [(-1)ⁿ⁻ᵏ g⁽ⁿ⁻ᵏ⁾]` of products of the (nonnegative) alternating
derivatives of `f` and `g`. For the negated derivative, the `(n+1)`-st alternating derivative of
`f` is the `n`-th alternating derivative of `-f'`. Mathlib has the analogous closure lemmas for
`AbsolutelyMonotoneOn` only up to sums and scalar multiples (`AbsolutelyMonotoneOn.add`,
`AbsolutelyMonotoneOn.smul`), so the multiplicative and differential closure built here is new.

These workhorses combine with the prototypes `t ↦ e^{-x t}` to manufacture completely monotone
functions: e.g. any finite sum `∑ⱼ cⱼ e^{-xⱼ t}` with `cⱼ, xⱼ ≥ 0`, or a product like
`t ↦ e^{-x t} / (1 + t)`-style mixtures once their factors are known completely monotone. The
negated-derivative closure is the first step towards the completely-monotone ↔ Bernstein-function
correspondence (a Bernstein function is a nonnegative function whose derivative is completely
monotone).

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.IsCompletelyMonotone.mul`: completely monotone functions are closed under pointwise
  multiplication.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsCompletelyMonotone.prod`: closure under finite products.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsCompletelyMonotone.pow`: closure under natural powers.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsCompletelyMonotone.neg_one_pow_mul_iteratedDerivWithin`: every alternating
  iterated derivative of a completely monotone function is completely monotone.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsCompletelyMonotone.neg_derivWithin`: the negated derivative within `[0, ∞)` of a
  completely monotone function is completely monotone.
