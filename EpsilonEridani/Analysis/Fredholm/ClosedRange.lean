# Closed range from a finite-dimensional cokernel

For the nonlinear-analysis substrate of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap (Lane F0, "Fredholm
operators and index theory"), this file proves that the closed-range hypothesis in the definition
of a Fredholm operator is *automatic* between Banach spaces once the cokernel is finite
dimensional.

Concretely, a continuous linear map `T : E →L[𝕜] F` between complete normed spaces whose cokernel
`F ⧸ range T` is finite dimensional already has closed range. The proof is a clean application of
the Banach open mapping theorem: choosing a finite-dimensional algebraic complement `N` of
`range T`, the auxiliary map `Φ(x, n) = T x + n` from `E × N` is a continuous linear surjection
between Banach spaces, hence a quotient map. Its preimage `Φ ⁻¹' range T = E × {0}` is closed, and
a quotient map carries the closed-set characterization that a set is closed exactly when its
preimage is, so `range T` is closed.

This upgrades the Fredholm predicate of `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.Fredholm.Basic`: over Banach spaces over
an `IsRCLikeNormedField` (in particular, real or complex Banach spaces), a Fredholm operator is
*exactly* a continuous linear map with finite-dimensional kernel and cokernel, the closed-range
condition following for free. Downstream this lets Sard–Smale and transversality arguments certify
Fredholmness of a linearization from the two defect spaces alone, without a separate closed-range
check.

## Main declarations

* `ContinuousLinearMap.isClosed_range_of_finite_coker`: a continuous linear map
  between Banach spaces with finite-dimensional cokernel has closed range.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.IsFredholm.of_finite_ker_coker`: over Banach spaces over an
  `IsRCLikeNormedField`, finite-dimensional kernel and cokernel suffice for Fredholmness.
* `EpsilonEridani.isFredholm_iff_finite_ker_coker`: over Banach spaces over an
  `IsRCLikeNormedField`, the Fredholm predicate is equivalent to finite dimensionality of the
  kernel and cokernel.

The conventions follow McDuff--Salamon, *J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*, Appendix
A.1, where a Fredholm operator has finite-dimensional kernel and cokernel; the closed-range
condition is noted there to be automatic between Banach spaces.

/-- A continuous linear map between Banach spaces whose cokernel `F ⧸ range T` is finite
dimensional has closed range.

Closedness of the range is therefore not an independent hypothesis in the Banach setting: it is
forced by finite dimensionality of the cokernel. The proof runs the Banach open mapping theorem on
the surjection `Φ(x, n) = T x + n` from `E × N`, where `N` is a finite-dimensional algebraic
complement of `range T`. -/
