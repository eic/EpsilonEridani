# The a priori estimate of a closed-range operator

A continuous linear map `T : E →L[𝕜] F` between Banach spaces with closed range fails to be
bounded below only in the direction of its kernel. When that kernel is complemented, this file
makes the failure quantitative, in the classical form

`‖x‖ ≤ C * ‖T x‖ + ‖P x‖`,

where `P` is a continuous projection of `E` onto `ker T`. For a Fredholm operator the kernel is
finite-dimensional, so the estimate turns an operator bound into a compactness statement: the
correction term ranges over a finite-dimensional — hence locally compact — direction.

The proof is one application of the open mapping theorem, in the packaged form
`ContinuousLinearMap.antilipschitz_of_injective_of_isClosed_range`: on a topological complement
`X₁` of the kernel, `T` is injective with closed range, so it is bounded below there. Mathlib's
file carries a `TODO` asking for exactly this generalisation once Fredholm operators are available.

## Main declarations

* `ContinuousLinearMap.exists_norm_le_mul_norm_of_mem`: a closed-range operator is bounded below
  on any topological complement of its kernel.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.exists_norm_le_mul_norm_add_norm_projectionL`: the a priori estimate
  against the projection onto the kernel determined by a chosen complement.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.exists_projection_norm_le`: the same estimate with the
  complement discharged, so that the only data left is a continuous projection with range the
  kernel.

Lane F0 of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap asks for the nonlinear-analysis substrate over the
linear Fredholm theory, and `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.Fredholm.Proper` uses the estimate below to prove
that a map with Fredholm derivative is proper near a point (Smale, *An infinite dimensional version
of Sard's theorem*, Amer. J. Math. 87 (1965)); local properness is in turn what makes the critical
values of such a map locally closed, and hence what upgrades Sard--Smale from a density statement
to a residuality statement.

variable [CompleteSpace E] [CompleteSpace F]

/-- **A closed-range operator is bounded below off its kernel.** On any topological complement
`X₁` of `ker T` there is a constant `C > 0` with `‖x‖ ≤ C * ‖T x‖` for every `x ∈ X₁`.

This is `ContinuousLinearMap.antilipschitz_of_injective_of_isClosed_range` applied to the
restriction of `T` to `X₁`, which is injective because `X₁` meets the kernel trivially, and has
closed range because that range is the range of `T`. -/

When `ker T` is finite-dimensional, the correction term `‖P x‖` ranges over a finite-dimensional

error". -/
