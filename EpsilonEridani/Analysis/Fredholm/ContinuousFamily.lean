# Continuous families of Fredholm operators

The Fredholm index is locally constant in a continuous family of Fredholm operators. Consequently,
it is constant when the parameter space is preconnected, and in particular at the endpoints of a
path of Fredholm operators.

This is the continuous-family form of stability under small perturbations. It is a basic input to
the spectral-flow and Riemann--Roch-with-boundary developments in Lanes F0 and F1.3 of the analytic
Heegaard Floer roadmap: a family can change index only by leaving the Fredholm locus.

The proofs use the operator-norm neighborhood on which
`ContinuousLinearMap.IsFredholm.eventually_isFredholm_and_index_eq` makes the index constant,
together with Mathlib's general API for locally constant functions on preconnected spaces.

## Main declarations

* `Continuous.isLocallyConstant_index`: the index of a continuous Fredholm family is
  locally constant.
* `ContinuousOn.index_eq_of_isPreconnected`: two parameters in the same preconnected set
  give operators of equal index.
* `Continuous.index_eq_of_preconnectedSpace`: a continuous Fredholm family over a
  preconnected space has constant index.
* `Path.index_eq`: the endpoints of a continuous Fredholm path have equal index.
* `index_eq_of_segment`: two operators joined by a Fredholm affine segment have equal
  index.

The index convention and its perturbation stability follow McDuff--Salamon,
*J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*, Appendix A.1.
