# Fredholm operators from finite-codimension restrictions

Let `T : E →L[𝕜] F` carry a closed finite-codimensional subspace `E₁` into a closed
finite-codimensional subspace `F₁`. Mathlib's `ContinuousLinearMap.IsFredholm.of_restrict`
shows that `T` is Fredholm when the induced operator `E₁ →L[𝕜] F₁` is. This file records the
accompanying index formula: the index of `T` is the index of the restriction plus
`codim E₁ - codim F₁`. It is a basic reduction for the Fredholm-operator substrate in Lane F0
of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap, in particular when an operator is first controlled
after discarding finitely many modes.

## Main declarations

* `ContinuousLinearMap.index_restrict`: the index formula for the restriction of a
  continuous linear map to closed finite-codimensional subspaces.

The finite-codimension reduction and index convention follow McDuff--Salamon,
*J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*, Appendix A.1. The proof factors `T` through
the inclusions of the subspaces and applies Mathlib's composition formula for the index.
