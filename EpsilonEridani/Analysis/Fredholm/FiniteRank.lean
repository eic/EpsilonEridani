# The index under finite-rank perturbations of Fredholm operators

That a finite-rank perturbation of a Fredholm operator is again Fredholm is Mathlib's
`ContinuousLinearMap.IsFredholm.add_hasFiniteRange`. This file records the corresponding index
statement, which follows by restricting both operators to the kernel of the perturbation.

Finiteness of the rank is spelled with Mathlib's `LinearMap.HasFiniteRange`, matching the
hypothesis of `ContinuousLinearMap.IsFredholm.add_hasFiniteRange`.

## Main declarations

* `ContinuousLinearMap.index_add_of_hasFiniteRange`: over a complete nontrivially normed
  field, adding an operator of finite rank preserves the Fredholm index.

/-- Over a complete nontrivially normed field, perturbing a Fredholm operator by an operator of
finite rank leaves its index unchanged: both operators restrict to the same map on the closed,
finite-codimensional subspace `ker K`, and additivity of the index cancels the index shift of that
restriction. -/
