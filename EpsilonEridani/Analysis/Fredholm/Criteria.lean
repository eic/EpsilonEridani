# Injective and surjective criteria for Fredholm operators

This file gives streamlined Fredholm criteria when an operator is already known to be injective
or surjective. Between Banach spaces over an `IsRCLikeNormedField`, a surjective continuous linear
map is Fredholm exactly when its kernel is finite dimensional. Between Banach spaces over any
nontrivially normed field, an injective continuous linear map with closed range is Fredholm exactly
when its cokernel is finite dimensional. Specialising both sides gives the bijective corollary:
a bijective continuous linear map between Banach spaces is Fredholm.

These criteria are the elementary endpoints of the finite-dimensional reductions used throughout
Fredholm theory. As an application of the injective closed-range criterion, the inclusion of the
kernel of an operator of finite rank is Fredholm.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.isFredholm_iff_finite_ker_of_surjective`: the surjective criterion.
* `EpsilonEridani.isFredholm_iff_finite_coker_of_injective`: the injective closed-range
  criterion.
* `EpsilonEridani.isFredholm_ker_subtypeL`: the inclusion of the kernel of an operator of finite rank is
  Fredholm.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.index_of_surjective` and
  `ContinuousLinearMap.index_of_injective`: the index in the two one-sided cases.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.finrank_ker_eq_iff_index_eq`: for a surjective operator, index `n`
  and kernel dimension `n` are the same statement.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.bijective_of_surjective_of_index_eq_zero`: a surjective operator of
  index zero with finite-dimensional kernel is bijective.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.IsFredholm.of_bijective`: a bijective continuous linear map between Banach
  spaces is Fredholm.

The conventions follow McDuff--Salamon, *J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*, Appendix
A.1.
