# A regular level set of a Fredholm map is a manifold

Let `f : E → F` be a map between Banach spaces which, at every point of the level set
`{x | f x = c}`, is strictly differentiable and `C^m`, with surjective Fredholm derivative of
index `n`. `EpsilonEridani.levelSetChartedSpace` already makes that level set a charted space modelled on
`Fin n → 𝕜`, the charts being the implicit-function charts of `EpsilonEridani.levelSetChartAt`. This file
proves that those charts are smoothly compatible, so the level set is a `C^m` manifold of
dimension the index.

The transition from the chart at `z` to the chart at `w` is
`k ↦ Ψ (x k - w)`, where `x k` is the point of the level set with coordinate `k` in the chart at
`z`, and `Ψ` is the continuous linear map that reads a vector of `E` in the model space through the
projection onto `ker (D w)`. So everything reduces to smoothness of the inverse chart as a map
into `E`, which is `EpsilonEridani.contDiffAt_coe_levelSetChart_symm_of_mem`: the inverse chart is smooth
at every point of its target, because `EpsilonEridani.levelSetChartAt` was cut down to the neighbourhood
`EpsilonEridani.levelSetImplicitCoordSource` on which the coordinate map of the implicit function theorem
keeps an invertible derivative.

This is the smooth half of the statement that the zero set of a Fredholm section is, at a regular
point, a manifold of dimension the index. As with the charted-space structure it refines, no
global hypothesis such as second countability is assumed, so `IsManifold` here is the smooth-atlas
statement and not the assertion that the level set is a topological manifold in the classical
sense.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.contDiffOn_coe_levelSetChartAt_symm`: the inverse of a preferred chart, included into
  the ambient Banach space, is `C^m` on the whole chart target.
* `EpsilonEridani.contDiffOn_levelSetChartAt_trans`: the transition between two preferred charts is
  `C^m`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isManifold_levelSet`: a regular level set of a `C^m` Fredholm map, of constant index
  `n`, is a `C^m` manifold modelled on `Fin n → 𝕜`.

/-- **A regular level set of a Fredholm map is a `C^m` manifold of dimension its index.** If `f` is
strictly differentiable and `C^m` at every point of the level set `{x | f x = c}`, with surjective
Fredholm derivative of index `n` there, then the charted-space structure of
`EpsilonEridani.levelSetChartedSpace` is a `C^m` atlas.

Together with `EpsilonEridani.levelSetChartedSpace` this is the "the zero set of a Fredholm section is,
at a regular point, a manifold of dimension the index" statement; as there, no global hypothesis
is assumed, so this is a statement about the atlas and not about second countability. -/
