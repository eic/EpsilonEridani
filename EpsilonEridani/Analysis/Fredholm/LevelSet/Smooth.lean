# Smooth parametrizations of regular Fredholm level sets

At a point where a map between Banach spaces has surjective derivative with complemented kernel,
`EpsilonEridani.levelSetChart` identifies its level set locally with that kernel. This file proves that
the inverse chart is, at the chart origin, as smooth as the original map, and computes its
derivative there: it is the canonical inclusion of the kernel into the ambient space.

The smoothness statement is Tau Ceti's
`HasStrictFDerivAt.contDiffAt_implicitToOpenPartialHomeomorphOfComplemented_symm`, restricted to
the slice `{c} × ker f'` on which the chart is the implicit function. The derivative statement is
Mathlib's `HasStrictFDerivAt.to_implicitFunctionOfComplemented`, transported along the chart. The
geometric organization follows McDuff--Salamon, *J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*,
2nd ed., Appendix A.3.

Together with `ContinuousLinearMap.IsFredholm.closedComplemented_ker_coprod`, which supplies the
complemented kernel of a surjective linearization whose fixed-parameter part is Fredholm, these
are the pointwise smoothness and derivative computation from which the smooth local input to the
parameter projection and Sard--Smale arguments is assembled.

Smoothness at the origin alone does not let two charts of the same level set be compared; the
final theorem removes that restriction. It is `C^n` at every point of the chart target whose
image lies in `HasStrictFDerivAt.implicitCoordSource`, the neighbourhood of the base point on which
the coordinate map of the implicit function theorem keeps an invertible derivative. Since that
neighbourhood is open and contains the base point, the inverse chart is smooth on a whole
neighbourhood of its origin, which is what smooth compatibility of charts needs.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.contDiffAt_coe_levelSetChart_symm`: the inverse regular-level-set chart, included into
  the ambient Banach space, is smooth at its origin.
* `EpsilonEridani.hasStrictFDerivAt_coe_levelSetChart_symm`: its derivative there is the inclusion of the
  derivative's kernel.
* `EpsilonEridani.contDiffAt_coe_levelSetChart_symm_of_mem`: it is smooth at every point of the chart
  target that the coordinate map's invertibility neighbourhood covers.

/-- **The inverse regular-level-set chart is smooth away from its centre as well.** At a point `k`
of the chart target whose image lies in the neighbourhood
`HasStrictFDerivAt.implicitCoordSource` on which the implicit-function coordinate map keeps an
invertible derivative, the inverse chart is as smooth as the equation is there.

`EpsilonEridani.contDiffAt_coe_levelSetChart_symm` is the case `k = 0`, where the hypotheses hold
automatically. -/
