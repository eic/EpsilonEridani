# A map with upper semi-Fredholm derivative is proper near the point

A continuous map between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces need not be proper: a Fredholm linear
map with nonzero kernel has a noncompact fibre over zero. A map whose derivative at a point `a` is
closed-range with finite-dimensional complemented kernel — in particular, a **Fredholm**
operator — is nonetheless proper on a neighbourhood of `a`:

`∃ N ∈ 𝓝 a, ∀ L compact, N ∩ f ⁻¹' L is compact`.

This is Smale's local properness lemma, the geometric half of the input to the Sard--Smale theorem
(Smale, *An infinite dimensional version of Sard's theorem*, Amer. J. Math. 87 (1965), 861–866;
McDuff--Salamon, *J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*, Appendix A). Its consequence
recorded here is that the preimage `f ⁻¹' L` of a compact set — in particular a level set
`f ⁻¹' {c}`, the shape every moduli space of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap takes — is a
**locally compact** space, even though the Banach space it sits inside is not.

The proof is quantitative rather than chart-theoretic. The a priori estimate
`ContinuousLinearMap.exists_projection_norm_le` supplies a continuous projection `P`
of `E` onto `ker f'` and a constant `C > 0` with `‖x‖ ≤ C * ‖f' x‖ + ‖P x‖`. On a small enough
closed ball `N` around `a`, strict differentiability turns this into the two-sided bound

`‖x - y‖ ≤ 2 * (C * ‖f x - f y‖) + 2 * ‖P x - P y‖`  for `x, y ∈ N`,

so the map `x ↦ (f x, P x)` is anti-Lipschitz on `N`. Its second component takes values in the
finite-dimensional space `ker f'`, where bounded sets have compact closure, so `x ↦ (f x, P x)`
sends `N ∩ f ⁻¹' L` into a compact box; being anti-Lipschitz, it reflects total boundedness, and
`N ∩ f ⁻¹' L` is totally bounded and closed, hence compact.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.one_sub_mul_norm_sub_le`: an a priori estimate survives a nonlinear
  approximation, degraded by its quality — the absorption step behind Peetre's lemma.
* `HasStrictFDerivAt.exists_mem_nhds_forall_isCompact_inter_preimage`: local properness.
* `HasStrictFDerivAt.exists_mem_nhds_isCompact_inter_preimage_singleton`: an arbitrary fibre is
  compact near the point of differentiation.
* `EpsilonEridani.locallyCompactSpace_preimage` and `EpsilonEridani.locallyCompactSpace_preimage_singleton`: the
  preimage of a compact set, and in particular a level set, along which the derivative is Fredholm
  is locally compact.

Lane F0 of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap asks for the package "a moduli space is the zero
set of a Fredholm section, and at a regular point a manifold of dimension the index", of which
`EpsilonEridani.Analysis.Fredholm.LevelSet.Basic` supplies the charts. Local properness is the
complementary topological half, and it is what will make the critical values of a Fredholm map
locally closed in the Sard--Smale argument.

/-- **An a priori estimate survives a nonlinear approximation, degraded by its quality.** Suppose
every vector is controlled by its image under `f'` together with an auxiliary additive map `P`,
as `‖z‖ ≤ C * ‖f' z‖ + ‖P z‖`, and `f` approximates `f'` on `N` to within `ε`. Then the same
control holds for `f` on `N`, with the left side scaled by `1 - C * ε`; it has content exactly
when `C * ε < 1`, and taking `ε ≤ (2 * C)⁻¹` gives the factor-two form properness uses.

Nothing about `P` beyond `map_sub` enters, so it need only be additive into a seminormed additive
group — no scalar-linearity, no idempotence, no constraint on its target. Taking it to be the
projection onto `ker f'` from `ContinuousLinearMap.exists_projection_norm_le` recovers the Peetre
estimate, which characterises semi-Fredholm operators — see Wendl, *Fredholm operators*,
Lemma 5.2. -/

/-- **The two-sided bound is exactly anti-Lipschitzness of the coordinate `x ↦ (f x, P x)`.**
The bound of `one_sub_mul_norm_sub_le` controls `‖x - y‖` by the two components separately; since
the product norm is the maximum, each is at most the distance between the pairs, and the two
constants add.

The constant `2 * C + 2` is not sharp — the maximum norm is what costs the factor. Sharpness
would need the weighted norm `‖u‖ + C⁻¹ * ‖v‖`, which mathlib does not instantiate on a product,
and no consumer here uses it. -/

differentiable at `a` and its derivative there has closed range and finite-dimensional

Compare `ContinuousLinearMap.exists_projection_norm_le`, the linear estimate this is read off
from: the kernel direction, in which `f'` loses all control, is finite-dimensional, so the loss of
compactness it causes is harmless. -/
