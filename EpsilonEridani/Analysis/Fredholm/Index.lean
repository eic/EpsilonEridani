# The Fredholm index

The Fredholm index of a continuous linear map is the integer `dim ker T − dim coker T`. Mathlib
already develops the purely algebraic `LinearMap.index`; this file transfers its elementary API to
continuous linear maps. The value is junk when the kernel or cokernel is infinite-dimensional,
following Mathlib's convention for `LinearMap.index`.

## Main declarations

* `ContinuousLinearMap.index`: the index of a continuous linear map.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.index_eq_finrank_sub`: the defining dimension formula.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.index_eq_of_finiteDimensional`: between finite-dimensional spaces,
  the index is the dimension of the domain minus the dimension of the codomain.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.index_id`, `index_continuousLinearEquiv_eq_zero`, and
  `index_eq_zero_of_bijective`: identities, continuous linear equivalences, and bijective maps have
  index zero.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.index_smul` and `index_neg`: nonzero rescaling and negation preserve
  the index.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.index_equiv_comp` and `index_comp_equiv`: composition with a
  continuous linear equivalence preserves the index.
The sign convention follows McDuff--Salamon, *J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*,
Appendix A.1.
