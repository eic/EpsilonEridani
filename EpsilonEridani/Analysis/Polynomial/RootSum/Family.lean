# Analytic coordinate changes across families of root blocks

An elementary-symmetric chart on a symmetric power of a complex surface separates a tuple into
points lying in finitely many disjoint coordinate patches. If the multiplicity in patch `i` is
`m i`, its coordinates form a block `Fin (m i) → ℂ`; a bijection
`(Σ i, Fin (m i)) ≃ Fin n` regroups those blocks into the model space `Fin n → ℂ`.

`EpsilonEridani.Sym.analyticAt_coeffEquiv_map_coeffEquiv_symm_of_analyticAt` proves that changing a
holomorphic surface coordinate is analytic on one block, including where roots collide. This file
applies that result to a finite family of blocks and then conjugates the family by the possibly
different source and target regroupings. The multiplicity-free `RCLike` version remains in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Polynomial/SimpleRoots/Family.lean`; the assembled complex statement is
`EpsilonEridani.Sym.analyticAt_piSigmaConstHomeomorph_coeffEquiv_map_coeffEquiv_symm_of_analyticAt`.

Thus the blockwise coordinate-change expression used by elementary-symmetric charts sharing one
block partition is analytic at every represented tuple. The transition between charts with
arbitrary block partitions is proved directly from the filtered root sums of
`EpsilonEridani.Sym.analyticAt_sum_map_filter_coeffEquiv_symm` in
`EpsilonEridani/Geometry/Manifold/SymmetricPower/Transition.lean`. For background on the symmetric-power
setting, see
Ozsváth--Szabó, [arXiv:math/0101206](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0101206), Section 2.2. The
blockwise analytic statement and proof in this file are developed here, rather than attributed to
that section.

/-- **Coordinate changes on a finite family of root blocks are analytic.**

For each `i`, the coefficient tuple `c₀ i` determines a finite multiset of complex points. Applying
`φ i` to those points and returning to elementary-symmetric coordinates is analytic jointly in the
family of coefficient blocks, provided `φ i` is analytic at every represented point. -/

/-- **A blockwise elementary-symmetric coordinate change is analytic after regrouping.**

The bijections `e` and `e'` are the independent choices used to identify the source and target
families of coefficient blocks with `Fin n → ℂ`. The transition first undoes `e`, changes the
underlying coordinate separately on each root block, and then regroups along `e'`. It is analytic
at every represented tuple, including tuples with repeated points. -/
