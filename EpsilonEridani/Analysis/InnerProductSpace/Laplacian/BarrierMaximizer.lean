# The maximizer step shared by the lower-order weak maximum principles

Both lower-order weak maximum principles — for `-Δ + c` in
`EpsilonEridani.Analysis.InnerProductSpace.Laplacian.ZerothOrderMaximumPrinciple` and for
`-Δ - b·∇ + c` in `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.InnerProductSpace.Laplacian.LowerOrderMaximumPrinciple` —
perturb a subsolution by a barrier, take a maximizer of the perturbation over the compact set, and
then argue that the frontier bound already holds at that maximizer. Only the last step is common:
the two differ in how they produce the maximizer and in which barrier they use.

This module holds that step, stated once for the operator `Δ + b·∇` with an arbitrary barrier. The
`-Δ + c` principle runs it at `b = 0` with the quadratic barrier `‖·‖²`.

It is a support module: `EpsilonEridani.le_of_isMaxOn_add_smul` is support API for those two proofs rather
than a result the roadmap asks for. Both principles import this module non-publicly, so neither
re-exports it and nothing downstream of either principle sees the step in its interface.

/-- **The maximizer step of the lower-order weak maximum principles.** Let `z` be a maximizer of
`f + ε • w` over `K`. If `f z ≤ m` whenever `z` is a frontier point, and, whenever `z` is interior
and `f z` exceeds `m`, the operator `Δ + ∇_v` is nonnegative on `f` at `z` while the barrier `w` is
`C²` and strictly positive under that operator at `z`, then `f z ≤ m`.

The direction is a single vector `v`, and the regularity and operator-sign hypotheses `hcd`,
`hLf0`, `hwcd`, `hwpos` are asked for at `z` alone and only when `z` is interior. A caller holding
the usual `∀ x ∈ interior K` form instantiates it at `z`, as `fun h => hcd h`; a caller with a drift
field `b` passes `b z`. -/
