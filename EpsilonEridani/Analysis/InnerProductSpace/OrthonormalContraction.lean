# Contracting the tensor square of an inner product space against an orthonormal basis

An orthonormal basis `e` of an inner product space `V` identifies `V` with its dual, through
`Module.Basis.toDualEquiv` of the underlying basis: the dual vector of `v` is `u ↦ ∑ vᵢ uᵢ` in the
coordinates of `e`. That pairing is the **bilinear** form `⟪J v, u⟫`, for `J` the coordinatewise
conjugation of `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/Conjugation.lean`, because the
conjugate-linearity of `J` cancels the conjugate-linearity of the first argument of the inner
product (`EpsilonEridani.toBasis_toDual_apply`).

Feeding that identification into Mathlib's contraction `dualTensorHomEquivOfBasis`, which turns
`Module.Dual 𝕜 V ⊗[𝕜] V` into the endomorphisms of `V`, contracts the tensor square:

`v ⊗ w ↦ (u ↦ ⟪J v, u⟫ • w)`.

The composite is a **linear equivalence** `V ⊗[𝕜] V ≃ₗ[𝕜] (V →ₗ[𝕜] V)` whose inverse spreads an
endomorphism over the basis, `A ↦ ∑ i, e i ⊗ₜ A (e i)`; only the finiteness of the index type is
needed, no completeness and no `FiniteDimensional` instance beyond it.

The equivalence depends on the basis, exactly as the conjugation describing it does, and that is
the point: `V` has no canonical bilinear form, so a choice has to enter. Its consumer is
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Continuous/Square/Invariants.lean`, where an invariant tensor of a
unitary representation is turned into an intertwiner and Schur's lemma bounds how many there can
be.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.tensorSquareEquivEnd`: the contraction `V ⊗[𝕜] V ≃ₗ[𝕜] (V →ₗ[𝕜] V)`.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.toBasis_toDual_apply`: the dual vector that an orthonormal basis attaches to `v` pairs
  against `u` as `⟪J v, u⟫`. This is the bridge between Mathlib's contraction and the conjugation.
* `EpsilonEridani.tensorSquareEquivEnd_tmul_apply` and `EpsilonEridani.tensorSquareEquivEnd_symm_apply`: the two
  directions on generators. Everything downstream goes through these rather than through the
  definition.

/-- **The dual vector of an orthonormal basis is pairing against the conjugate.** In the
coordinates of `e` the dual vector `Module.Basis.toDual` attaches to `v` is `u ↦ ∑ vᵢ uᵢ`, which is
`⟪J v, u⟫`: the inner product is conjugate-linear in its first argument and `J` is
conjugate-linear, so the two conjugations cancel and the pairing is `𝕜`-bilinear. -/
