# A positive-definite form is the standard one in suitable coordinates

Let `S` be a symmetric operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space `V` whose associated
Hermitian form `⟪S v, w⟫` is positive definite. This file produces a linear automorphism of `V`
along which that form pulls back to the inner product `V` already carries:

`EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousLinearEquiv_inner_map_map` gives `e : V ≃L[𝕜] V` with
`⟪S (e x), e y⟫ = ⟪x, y⟫` for all `x` and `y`.

Equivalently `e` is an isometry from `(V, ⟪·,·⟫)` onto `(V, ⟪S ·, ·⟫)`, so its inverse is the
operator usually written `S ^ (1 / 2)`; the construction here avoids building an operator square
root by scaling an orthonormal eigenbasis of `S` instead. The eigenvalues of `S` are positive
because the form is definite, so dividing the `i`-th eigenvector by `√(λ i)` produces a basis that
is orthonormal *for the form*, and `e` is the map carrying the eigenbasis to it.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousLinearEquiv_inner_map_map`: a positive-definite symmetric operator's
  form becomes the standard inner product after a change of coordinates.

Only the existence of `e` is exported, since it depends on a choice of eigenbasis. The operator is
taken continuous and the change of coordinates produced is a continuous linear equivalence; on a
finite-dimensional space that is no restriction either way, and it is the form the consumer both
supplies and wants.

The intended consumer is Weyl's unitarian trick: applied to the Gram operator of the Haar-averaged
inner product of a representation of a compact group, this is what turns the invariant form into
an honest unitary structure, in
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Compact/UnitaryModel.lean`.

/-- **A positive-definite form is standard in suitable coordinates.** If `S` is a symmetric
operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space whose form `⟪S ·, ·⟫` is positive definite,
then there is a continuous linear automorphism `e` with `⟪S (e x), e y⟫ = ⟪x, y⟫`.

The automorphism is the inverse of the square root of `S`, built without any operator functional
calculus: an orthonormal eigenbasis `b` of `S` has positive eigenvalues `λ i`, so the vectors
`(√(λ i))⁻¹ • b i` are orthonormal for the form `⟪S ·, ·⟫`, and `e` is the automorphism carrying
`b i` to them. -/
