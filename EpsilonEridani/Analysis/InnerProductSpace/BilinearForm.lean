# The bilinear form of a tensor on an inner product space

On an inner product space the inner product turns a tensor `t : V ⊗[𝕜] V` into a bilinear form on
`V`,

`B_t (v, w) = ⟪t, v ⊗ₜ w⟫`,

`EpsilonEridani.BilinForm.ofTensor`. The construction is conjugate-linear in `t` and always injective, so
a tensor is determined by its form; it is **surjective only in finite dimensions**, where it
therefore identifies the tensor square with all of `BilinForm 𝕜 V`
(`EpsilonEridani.BilinForm.ofTensorEquiv`). In infinite dimensions it is just an injection: the tensor
square is spanned by the finite sums of pure tensors, while a general bilinear form need not be one.

The construction carries the flip `x ⊗ y ↦ y ⊗ x` to the exchange of the two arguments of a form,
so the **symmetric tensors** `EpsilonEridani.symmetricTensors` become the **symmetric** forms and the
**antisymmetric tensors** `EpsilonEridani.antisymmetricTensors` the **alternating** ones.

Nothing here needs a group or a representation: this is the purely bilinear half of the dictionary
that `EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Continuous/Square/BilinearForm.lean` makes equivariant for a
unitary representation.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.BilinForm.ofTensor`: the bilinear form `B_t (v, w) = ⟪t, v ⊗ₜ w⟫` of a tensor.
* `EpsilonEridani.BilinForm.ofTensorEquiv`: in finite dimensions, that construction as a conjugate-linear
  equivalence of the tensor square with the bilinear forms.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.BilinForm.ofTensor_injective` and `EpsilonEridani.BilinForm.ofTensor_surjective`: the
  construction is injective, and surjective in finite dimensions.
* `EpsilonEridani.BilinForm.isSymm_ofTensor_iff` and `EpsilonEridani.BilinForm.isAlt_ofTensor_iff`: the form of a
  tensor is symmetric, respectively alternating, exactly when the tensor is symmetric, respectively
  antisymmetric.

## Implementation notes

`EpsilonEridani.BilinForm.ofTensor` is conjugate-linear, not linear, so it is bundled as a semilinear map
`V ⊗[𝕜] V →ₛₗ[starRingEnd 𝕜] BilinForm 𝕜 V`; it is the composition of `innerSL` with the currying
`TensorProduct.lcurry`, so its behaviour on `0`, on sums, on negation and on differences is the
generic `map_zero`, `map_add`, `map_neg` and `map_sub`. Injectivity comes from
`TensorProduct.ext_iff_inner_right`; surjectivity in finite dimensions is read off
`EpsilonEridani.BilinForm.ofTensorEquiv`, which is assembled from the Riesz representation
`InnerProductSpace.toDual`, the identification `LinearMap.toContinuousLinearMap` of the linear with
the continuous linear functionals, and the currying `TensorProduct.lift.equiv`.

The two symmetry statements go through Mathlib's flip characterizations
`LinearMap.BilinForm.isSymm_iff_flip` and `LinearMap.isAlt_iff_eq_neg_flip`, so the only geometric
input is `EpsilonEridani.BilinForm.ofTensor_comm`, that the construction intertwines the flip of the
tensor square with the flip of a form.
