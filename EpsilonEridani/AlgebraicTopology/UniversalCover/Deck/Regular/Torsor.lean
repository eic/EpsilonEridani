# Fibres of regular connected covers as deck torsors

For a preconnected covering map with regular deck action, evaluation at any point of a fibre
identifies the deck group with that fibre. This file packages the same fact in the standard
Mathlib language of torsors: the fibre is a principal homogeneous space for the deck group.

Pointed covers and unpointed covers differ by changing a chosen lift of the basepoint, and
regular covers are characterized by transitivity of the deck action on fibres; the torsor
structure keeps track of both.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Deck.fiberTorsor`: the regular-cover specialization.
* `EpsilonEridani.Deck.fiber_sdiv_eq_deckEquivFiber_symm`: fibre division is the unique deck
  transformation carrying the second point to the first.

## References

It specializes the local torsor API in
`EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicTopology.UniversalCover.Deck.Connected.Torsor` using the regular deck-action
API in `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicTopology.UniversalCover.Deck.Regular.Basic`.
