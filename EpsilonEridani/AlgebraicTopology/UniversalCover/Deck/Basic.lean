# Deck transformations of a map

For a map `p : E → B`, its deck transformations are the homeomorphisms of `E` over `B`. Mathlib
collects them as the subgroup `deck p` of the homeomorphism group `E ≃ₜ E`; for a covering
projection `p` this subgroup is the classical deck transformation group.

This file adds the fibre API that the rest of the deck-transformation development uses.
In particular, `deck.fiberHomeomorph` restricts a deck transformation to each fibre of `p`.

The action of `deck p` on the total space is inherited, by subgroup transfer, from the
tautological action of the ambient homeomorphism group `E ≃ₜ E` on `E`
(`Homeomorph.applyMulAction`). Each deck transformation preserves `p`, hence
preserves every fibre of `p`.

The deck group only sees `p` through the equalities `p (φ e) = p e`, so postcomposition by an
injective map leaves it unchanged (`EpsilonEridani.deck_comp_of_injective`).

## References

The `deck` construction is due to Kim Morrison in
[mathlib4#40135](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/40135).
