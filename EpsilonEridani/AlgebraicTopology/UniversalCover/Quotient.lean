# The fundamental-group quotient of the universal cover

The fundamental group of a path-connected, locally path-connected space acts on its based-path
universal cover. Two points of the universal cover have the same
endpoint exactly when they belong to the same orbit. The endpoint projection therefore descends to
a homeomorphism

`UniversalCover x₀ / FundamentalGroup X x₀ ≃ₜ X`.

This is the topological quotient statement associated to the universal cover. It uses the actual
fundamental-group action on based path classes, rather than first replacing that action by the
isomorphic deck-transformation group.

## Main declaration

* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalCover.orbitQuotientHomeomorph`: the fundamental-group orbit quotient of the
  universal cover is homeomorphic to the base.

## References

Compare Hatcher, *Algebraic Topology*, Section 1.3, especially Propositions 1.39 and 1.40. The
based-path construction and action are adapted from Kim Morrison's
[mathlib4#38292](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/38292).
