# Connected covering spaces are the categorically connected ones

Let `X` be path connected, locally path connected and semilocally simply connected. Covering
spaces of `X` carry two unrelated-looking notions of connectedness: the topological one, that the
total space is a `ConnectedSpace`, and the categorical one,
`CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.IsConnected`, which asks that the cover is not an initial object
of `EpsilonEridani.CoveringSpace X` and has no nontrivial subobject there. This file proves that they
agree.

The bridge is the classification of covers by `π₁(X, x₀)`-sets. Categorical connectedness is
invariant under an equivalence of categories (`EpsilonEridani.isConnected_map_iff`), so it can be read off
on the other side of `EpsilonEridani.CoveringSpace.fiberActionEquivalence`, where it says exactly that the
monodromy action on the fibre over `x₀` is transitive and nonempty
(`EpsilonEridani.isConnected_action_iff_isTransitiveAction`). That in turn is the condition already known
to characterise connected covers: transitivity of monodromy is
`EpsilonEridani.ConnectedCoveringSpace.isTransitiveAction_fiberAction`, and conversely a cover with
transitive monodromy has path-connected total space, because path lifting joins every point of the
total space to a point of the fibre over `x₀` and monodromy joins any two points of that fibre.
That converse needs no hypothesis on `X` beyond path connectedness, so the dictionary between
transitive monodromy and a connected total space is established before the classification is
invoked; only the passage to the categorical statement uses the full standing hypotheses.

The initial objects of `EpsilonEridani.CoveringSpace X` play no special role here: they are the covers
with empty total space over any base, which is
`EpsilonEridani.CoveringSpace.isInitial_iff_isEmpty` in the general covering-space API.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.CoveringSpace.isTransitiveAction_fiberAction_iff_connectedSpace`: the monodromy action
  on the fibre over `x₀` is transitive exactly when the total space is connected.
* `EpsilonEridani.CoveringSpace.isConnected_iff_connectedSpace`: **a covering space of `X` is a connected
  object of `EpsilonEridani.CoveringSpace X` exactly when its total space is a connected space.**
* `EpsilonEridani.ConnectedCoveringSpace.isConnected_forget_obj`: a connected covering space is a
  connected object of `EpsilonEridani.CoveringSpace X`.

## References

This is the connectedness dictionary for the alternative lens of Stage 2, item 8 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/UniversalCovers/README.md`. It consumes the classification of covers by
`π₁(X, x₀)`-sets and Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.IsConnected`; no Mathlib proof is
vendored.
