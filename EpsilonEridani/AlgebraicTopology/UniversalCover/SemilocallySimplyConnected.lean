# The local hypotheses for existence of a universal cover

The universal cover of `X` is built over a base assumed path-connected, locally path-connected,
and semilocally simply connected. Semilocal simple connectivity is not merely convenient there:
by the local-homeomorphism results in
`EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicTopology.SemilocallySimplyConnected.Covering`, it is forced by the existence of
a simply connected cover. Local path-connectedness is likewise equivalent to requiring the total
space of that cover to be locally path-connected. This file packages both characterizations.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.semilocallySimplyConnectedSpace_iff_exists_isCoveringMap_and_simplyConnectedSpace`: a
  path-connected, locally path-connected space is semilocally simply connected if and only if it
  admits a simply connected covering space. This is the sense in which "`X` has a universal
  cover" and "`X` is semilocally simply connected" are the same condition.
* `EpsilonEridani.locallyPathConnectedSpace_and_semilocallySimplyConnectedSpace_iff_exists_universalCover`:
  for a path-connected space, the two local hypotheses hold exactly when it admits a simply
  connected, locally path-connected covering space.

## References

The construction of the universal cover consumed by the forward direction is adapted from Kim
Morrison's mathlib4 [#38292](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/38292); it is
credited where it lives, in `EpsilonEridani/AlgebraicTopology/UniversalCover/`. The converse is supplied
by `EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicTopology.SemilocallySimplyConnected.Covering`.

The forward direction is the universal-cover construction, the reverse direction is
`EpsilonEridani.SemilocallySimplyConnectedSpace.of_isCoveringMap`; surjectivity of the covering map is
automatic here, by `IsCoveringMap.comp_subtypeVal_pathComponent_surjective`, because the base is
path-connected and a simply connected total space is nonempty. -/

/-- **A path-connected space is locally path-connected and semilocally simply connected if and
only if it admits a simply connected, locally path-connected covering space.**

The local path-connectedness requirement on the total space is essential in this statement: the
identity is a simply connected covering map of any simply connected space, including one that is
not locally path-connected. -/
