# The fundamental groupoid of a simply connected space

A space is simply connected exactly when its fundamental groupoid is codiscrete: there is one
and only one morphism between any two of its objects. This file records that uniqueness as a
`Unique` instance on the hom types, so that a transport map along a path inside a simply
connected space can be written down without naming the path, and two such transports agree
because the morphisms realizing them are equal.

The two lemmas about a functor out of such a groupoid say that the resulting transport maps
compose as expected and that the unique endomorphism of an object is sent to an identity.
