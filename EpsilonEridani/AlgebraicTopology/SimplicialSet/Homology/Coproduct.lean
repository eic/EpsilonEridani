# The simplicial chain complex preserves colimits

In degree `n` the chain complex of a simplicial set `X` with coefficients in an object `R` is the
coproduct of copies of `R` indexed by the `n`-simplices of `X`.  Evaluating a simplicial set in a
fixed degree preserves colimits, because colimits of presheaves are computed pointwise, and
forming a coproduct of copies of `R` preserves colimits; hence so does `X ↦ X.chainComplex R`.

The case of a coproduct is chain-level additivity: the chain complex of a disjoint union of
simplicial sets is the coproduct of the chain complexes of the summands.
The chain map induced by a monomorphism of simplicial sets is also a monomorphism.

## Sources

The argument assembles three Mathlib constructions.  The simplicial chain complex
`SSet.chainComplexFunctor` and its degreewise cofan `SSet.isColimitChainComplexXCofan`
are due to Joël Riou and Andrew Yang in `Mathlib/AlgebraicTopology/SimplicialSet/Homology/Basic`;
the coproduct-of-copies functor `CategoryTheory.Limits.sigmaConst` and its colimit preservation
are due to Joël Riou in `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Limits/Preserves/SigmaConst`, as is the reduction
of colimit preservation to the degreewise statement,
`HomologicalComplex.preservesColimitsOfShape_of_eval`.
