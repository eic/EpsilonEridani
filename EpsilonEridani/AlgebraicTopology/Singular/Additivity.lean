# Additivity of singular chains and singular homology

A singular simplex of a disjoint union `Σ i, X i` has connected domain, so its image lies in a
single summand, and it comes from a singular simplex of that summand in exactly one way.  Hence
the singular simplicial set of a disjoint union is the coproduct of the singular simplicial sets
of the summands, and, since the simplicial chain complex functor preserves colimits, so is the
singular chain complex.

Passing to homology needs one more input: homology commutes with the coproduct of chain
complexes when coproducts are exact in the coefficient category (Grothendieck's axiom AB4, as for
modules over a ring).  Under that hypothesis the singular homology of a disjoint union is the
coproduct of the singular homologies of the summands in every degree.  This is the additivity
axiom of Eilenberg--Steenrod.

Every map in sight is induced by one of the inclusions `X i ⟶ Σ i, X i`, so the results are
statements about cofans rather than unrelated degreewise decompositions.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isColimitCofanSingularChainComplex`: the singular chain complex of `Σ i, X i` is the
  coproduct of the singular chain complexes of the `X i`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isColimitCofanSingularHomology`: if coproducts indexed by `ι` are exact in the
  coefficient category, the singular homology of `Σ i, X i` in each degree is the coproduct of the
  singular homologies of the `X i`.

## Sources

The informal source is Eilenberg--Steenrod, *Foundations of Algebraic Topology*, Chapters I--III.
The connectedness argument is Mathlib's `ContinuousMap.sigmaCodHomeomorph`, by Yury Kudryashov in
`Mathlib/Topology/ContinuousMap/Sigma`; the singular simplicial set `TopCat.toSSet` and the singular
chain complex `AlgebraicTopology.singularChainComplexFunctor` are by Andrew Yang in
`Mathlib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/Basic`, building on Joël Riou's `TopCat.toSSet`
adjunction; and the concrete cofan `TopCat.sigmaCofanIsColimit` is by Patrick Massot, Kim
Morrison, Mario Carneiro and Andrew Yang in `Mathlib/Topology/Category/TopCat/Limits/Products`.
The passage from chains to homology is
`EpsilonEridani.homologicalComplexHomologyFunctor_preservesColimitsOfShape`, in
`EpsilonEridani/Algebra/Homology/ShortComplex/Colimit`, applied with Mathlib's exactness class
`HasExactColimitsOfShape`.
