# Totality of a reflexive transitive closure as the absence of a closed proper subset

Read `r : α → α → Prop` as the edge relation of a directed graph. Saying that
`Relation.ReflTransGen r` relates every pair of points is the "any two points are joined by a
chain" form of connectedness; saying that every nonempty proper subset of `α` has an edge leaving
it is the "no disconnecting cut" form. `Relation.forall_reflTransGen_iff` is the translation
between the two, for an arbitrary relation on an arbitrary type.

## Main results

* `Relation.forall_reflTransGen_iff`: totality of `Relation.ReflTransGen r` is exactly the absence
  of a nonempty proper subset with no outgoing edge.

/-- **Totality of a reflexive transitive closure is the absence of a disconnecting cut.** Every
pair of points is joined by an `r`-chain exactly when every nonempty proper subset `s` carries an
edge from a point of `s` to a point outside `s`. -/
