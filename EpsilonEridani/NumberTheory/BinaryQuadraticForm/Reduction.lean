# The Hurwitz class number counts classes of forms

For `D ≠ 0` the Hurwitz class number `EpsilonEridani.hurwitzClassNumber D` is *defined* as a weighted
count of the reduced forms of discriminant `-D`. This file proves that it is the weighted count of
the `SL(2, ℤ)`-classes of positive definite integral binary quadratic forms of discriminant `-D`,
each class weighted by `2 / |Stab|`, where `Stab` is the stabiliser in `SL(2, ℤ)` of any form in
the class: `-1` acts trivially on forms, so `|Stab| / 2` is the order of the stabiliser in
`PSL(2, ℤ)`, and the weight is `1/2` on the classes of multiples of `x² + y²`, `1/3` on those of
multiples of `x² + x y + y²`, and `1` on all others.

The reduction theory is transported to the upper half-plane by the root map
`EpsilonEridani.BinaryQuadraticForm.root`, which sends `f = a x² + b x y + c y²` to the root
`τ = (-b + i √D) / (2 a)` of `a τ² + b τ + c`, and which is injective and `SL(2, ℤ)`-equivariant.
Since `re τ = -b / (2 a)` and `|τ|² = c / a`, the conditions defining a reduced form say exactly
that `τ` lies in the part of the fundamental domain `𝒟` left of its boundary identifications: the
points of `𝒟` with `re τ < 1/2` which, on the unit circle, have `re τ ≤ 0`. Every orbit of
`SL(2, ℤ)` on `ℍ` meets that region in exactly one point
(`EpsilonEridani.ModularGroup.exists_smul_mem_fd_left` and
`EpsilonEridani.ModularGroup.orbit_mk_injOn_fd_left`), so every class of forms contains exactly one
reduced form. The stabiliser of a form is that of its root, and for a reduced form `f` the root `τ`
lies in `𝒟`: the stabiliser has order `4` when `τ = i`, that is for the forms `⟨a, 0, a⟩`, order
`6` when `τ = ρ`, that is for the forms `⟨a, a, a⟩`, and order `2` otherwise, the corner `ρ + 1`
of `𝒟` having real part `1/2`. So `2 / |Stab|` is the weight `EpsilonEridani.reducedFormWeight` of the
reduced form in the class.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.BinaryQuadraticForm.isReducedForm_iff_root_mem`: a positive definite form is reduced
  exactly when its root lies in `𝒟`, has real part `< 1/2`, and has real part `≤ 0` if it lies on
  the unit circle.
* `EpsilonEridani.BinaryQuadraticForm.root_eq_I_iff` and `EpsilonEridani.BinaryQuadraticForm.root_eq_ρ_iff`: the
  forms with root `i` are the `⟨a, 0, a⟩`, those with root `ρ` the `⟨a, a, a⟩`.
* `EpsilonEridani.BinaryQuadraticForm.reducedFormWeight_eq_two_div_card_stabilizer`: the weight of a
  reduced form is `2 / |Stab|`.
* `EpsilonEridani.BinaryQuadraticForm.exists_smul_isReducedForm` and
  `EpsilonEridani.BinaryQuadraticForm.orbit_mk_injOn_isReducedForm`: every class of positive definite
  forms of discriminant `-D` contains exactly one reduced form (Cohen, §5.3).
* `EpsilonEridani.BinaryQuadraticForm.orbit_mk_reducedForms_bijective`: so the reduced forms of
  discriminant `-D` are in bijection with the classes, and there are finitely many classes
  (`EpsilonEridani.BinaryQuadraticForm.finite_orbitRel_quotient_posDef`).
* `EpsilonEridani.hurwitzClassNumber_eq_finsum`: for `D ≠ 0`, `H D` is the sum over the classes of
  `2 / |Stab|`.
