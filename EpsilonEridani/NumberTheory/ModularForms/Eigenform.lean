# Good Hecke eigenforms

A cusp form is a *good Hecke eigenform* when it is a simultaneous eigenvector of the Hecke
operators `T_n` for every `n` coprime to the level. This file names that condition as
`IsEigenformAwayFromLevel` and records the one fact that makes it usable: for such a form, the
`T_p` eigenvalue at a good prime is the `p`-th Fourier coefficient.

## Why "away from level"

The eigenvector condition is imposed only at `n` coprime to `N`. At the bad primes `p ∣ N` the
operator `U_p` is a different object and a form need not be an eigenvector of it, so a bare
`Eigenform` would be a promise this predicate does not keep — hence the qualified name.

## Main declarations

* `HeckeRing.GL2.IsEigenformAwayFromLevel`: the predicate, with
  `HeckeRing.GL2.isEigenformAwayFromLevel_def` as its characteristic restatement — the module
  does not expose the definition's body, so that lemma is how downstream callers prove and
  eliminate it.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.heckeTCuspNat_eq_qExpansion_coeff_smul_of_isEigenformAwayFromLevel`: for a
  normalized good eigenform, the `T_p` eigenvalue at a good prime is `a_p(f)`.

No bundled structure is introduced: this is a `Prop` on an existing `CuspForm`, because that is
what the consumers need.

## Implementation notes

The condition is stated over `heckeTCuspNat`, the packaged operator of
`HeckeSlash/Operators.lean`, rather than over the raw double-coset endomorphism it unfolds to.
That packaging exists precisely so that statements about `T_n` have one spelling.

## Provenance

Adapted from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project
(`HeckeRIngs/GL2/Newforms/Basic.lean`, Chris Birkbeck, Apache-2.0): the predicate `IsEigenform`,
renamed per the roadmap's prescribed spelling and restated over `heckeTCuspNat`. The source's
all-`n` variant `IsFullEigenform`, its bundled `Eigenform` structure and that structure's
accessors are deliberately not ported — the consumers here need the predicate.

/-- **The `T_p` eigenvalue of a normalized good eigenform is its `p`-th Fourier coefficient.**
For `p` a prime not dividing the level and `f` normalized (`a₁(f) = 1`), the eigenvector equation
at `p` holds with the scalar named explicitly as `a_p(f)`.
