# The diamond label of `Γ₀(N)` under reduction of the level

`CongruenceSubgroup.Gamma0Map` reads off the lower-right entry of a matrix of `Γ₀(N)` in
`ZMod N`, and `Gamma0Map_toHomUnits` is its unit-valued form. This file records the one fact
about that label which needs the reduction map `ZMod.unitsMap`: for `M ∣ N`, reading a matrix
of `Γ₀(N)` as a matrix of `Γ₀(M)` reduces its label along `(ZMod N)ˣ → (ZMod M)ˣ`.

It is a separate module from `EpsilonEridani.NumberTheory.ModularForms.CongruenceSubgroups.Basic`
because the statement is the only thing in the congruence-subgroup API that mentions
`ZMod.unitsMap`. Keeping it out of `Basic` keeps that foundational module from re-exporting
`Mathlib.Data.ZMod.Units` to its whole downstream cone.

## Main results

* `CongruenceSubgroup.Gamma0Map_toHomUnits_of_dvd`: for `M ∣ N`, the diamond label of a
  `Γ₀(N)` matrix read in `Γ₀(M)` is the reduction of its label at level `N`.

/-- **The diamond label is compatible with reduction.** For `M ∣ N`, a matrix of `Γ₀(N)` read as
a matrix of `Γ₀(M)` has lower-right entry the reduction of its lower-right entry at level `N`,
so a nebentypus character pulls back along `(ZMod N)ˣ → (ZMod M)ˣ`.

The membership proof is an explicit argument rather than `Gamma0_le_Gamma0_of_dvd h γ.2`, so that
the left-hand side mentions `h` nowhere: both `M` and `N` are still fixed by the left-hand side,
which leaves `M ∣ N` as an ordinary side condition simp can discharge from context. Written the
other way the divisibility is reachable only inside a proof term, and the `@[simp]` rule is
inert. -/
