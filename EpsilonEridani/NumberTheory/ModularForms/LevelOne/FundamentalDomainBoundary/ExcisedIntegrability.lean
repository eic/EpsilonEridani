# The excised boundary integrand is integrable

`intervalIntegral_excised_logDeriv_fdBoundary` assembles the excised boundary integral from
integrability *assumed* on `[0, 1]`, `[1, 2]` and `[4, 5]`. This file discharges that assumption,
for any subinterval of `[0, 5]` at once.

Both inputs the general criterion needs are available for the boundary contour: it is piecewise
`C¹` (`isPiecewiseC1On_fdBoundary`), which makes its derivative interval-integrable, and off the
excision the form is analytic and nonvanishing *at the contour points themselves*, so its
logarithmic derivative is analytic there (`analyticAt_logDeriv_of_analyticAt`) and in particular
continuous.

The analyticity hypothesis is stated **along the contour** rather than on an open set containing
the fundamental domain, because that is all the proof uses. Keeping it contour-local is what lets
the excision set here stay separate from the divisor set of the argument principle.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ModularForm.intervalIntegrable_excised_deriv_smul_logDeriv_comp_ofComplex_fdBoundary`:
  the excised boundary integrand is interval-integrable on any subinterval of `[0, 5]`.

/-- **The excised boundary integrand is integrable.** Off the excision the form is analytic and
nonvanishing at the contour points, so its logarithmic derivative is continuous there; the contour
is piecewise `C¹`, so its derivative is interval-integrable, and `EpsilonEridani.Contour`'s criterion
applies.

`hε` is needed to know that a point at distance `≥ ε` from every centre is not itself a centre. -/
