# The permutation module of the determinant-`n` matrix module

Popa and Zagier carry out their proof of the Eichler–Selberg trace formula in `ℛₙ = ℚ[ℳₙ]`, the
free `ℚ`-module on the projective determinant-`n` matrix module `ℳₙ`, which is
`EpsilonEridani.TraceFormulaMatrixModule n`. For `n ≠ 1` the set `ℳₙ` is not a group, since it does
not contain the identity matrix, of determinant `1`; `ℛₙ` is the free `ℚ`-module on `ℳₙ`, with
an action of the group ring `ℚ[PSL(2, ℤ)]` on each side. No new type is
introduced for it: `ℛₙ` is Mathlib's `MonoidAlgebra ℚ (TraceFormulaMatrixModule n)`, which is
the space of every permutation representation `Representation.ofMulAction ℚ G ℳₙ`. The three
actions of `PSL(2, ℤ)` on `ℳₙ` give three such representations on `ℛₙ`:

* the left action `Representation.ofMulAction ℚ PSL(2, ℤ) ℳₙ`, with `ρ g [M] = [g M]`;
* the right action `Representation.ofMulAction ℚ PSL(2, ℤ)ᵐᵒᵖ ℳₙ`, with
  `ρ (MulOpposite.op g) [M] = [M g]`, so that Popa–Zagier's product `ξ · g` is
  `Representation.ofMulAction ℚ PSL(2, ℤ)ᵐᵒᵖ ℳₙ (MulOpposite.op g) ξ`;
* the conjugation action `Representation.ofMulAction ℚ (ConjAct PSL(2, ℤ)) ℳₙ`, with
  `ρ (ConjAct.toConjAct g) [M] = [g M g⁻¹]`.

This file records how they fit together, over an arbitrary coefficient semiring `k`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.TraceFormulaMatrixModule.ofMulAction_coe`: the left representation of the class of a
  determinant-one matrix `g` is the left representation of `g` itself.
* `EpsilonEridani.TraceFormulaMatrixModule.ofMulAction_toConjAct`: the conjugation representation of `g`
  is the left representation of `g` after the right representation of `g⁻¹`.
* `EpsilonEridani.TraceFormulaMatrixModule.ofMulAction_S_sq`,
  `EpsilonEridani.TraceFormulaMatrixModule.ofMulAction_T_mul_S_pow_three`: on `k[ℳₙ]`, `S² = 1` and
  `U³ = 1` for `U = T S`, since `S² = U³ = -1` in `SL(2, ℤ)` and `-1` acts trivially.
* `EpsilonEridani.TraceFormulaMatrixModule.ofMulAction_op_S_sq`,
  `EpsilonEridani.TraceFormulaMatrixModule.ofMulAction_op_S_mul_op_T_pow_three`: `S² = 1` and `U³ = 1`
  for right multiplication on `k[ℳₙ]`, since both relations hold in `PSL(2, ℤ)`.

The left and right representations commute, so `ℛₙ` is a `ℚ[PSL(2, ℤ)]`-bimodule. This is the
general `EpsilonEridani.commute_ofMulAction` (in `EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.OfMulAction`), applied to
the instance `SMulCommClass PSL(2, ℤ) PSL(2, ℤ)ᵐᵒᵖ ℳₙ` saying that left and right
multiplication on `ℳₙ` commute.
