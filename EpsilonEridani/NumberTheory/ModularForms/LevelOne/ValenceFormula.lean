# The valence formula for level-one modular forms

The textbook valence formula, in orbit-sum form and with no hypothesis beyond `f ≠ 0`: for a
nonzero weight-`k` modular form on `SL₂(ℤ)`,

`ord_∞ f + 1/2 · ord_i f + 1/3 · ord_ρ f + ∑ (non-elliptic orbits q) ord_q f = k / 12`.

The proof assembles the two sides of the development. The contour side
(`FundamentalDomainBoundary/ValencePV.lean`) proves the identity for the divisor points of
any finite set capturing all zeros of the closed fundamental domain; instantiating it at the
canonical divisor set `fdZeros` discharges both capture hypotheses using `mem_fdZeros`. The
orbit side (`Order/OrbitReduction.lean`) rewrites the full non-elliptic orbit sum first as
the sum over the canonical left representatives and then as the three point-sum families —
strict interior, left vertical edge, left half-arc — which are literally the families of the
contour identity.

## The uniform form, and why it is the one general level needs

Singling out `i` and `ρ` is an artefact of level one, where those are the only two elliptic
points. The intrinsic statement weights *every* orbit by the reciprocal `1 / e_P` of its
elliptic order — the order of its `PSL(2, ℤ)`-stabiliser, `EpsilonEridani.ModularGroup.ellipticOrder` —
and then reads

`∑_{P ∈ SL₂(ℤ) \ ℍ} (1 / e_P) · ord_P f + ord_∞ f = k / 12`,

with the `1/2` and the `1/3` produced by `e_i = 2` and `e_ρ = 3` and every other weight equal
to `1`. That is `valence_formula_weighted` below, stated over `ℚ` because the weights are
rational and the two sides are; the level-one shape above is the special case obtained by
splitting off the two orbits at which `e_P ≠ 1`.

The uniform shape is what the general-level formula of the Tau Ceti ModularForms roadmap's
Layer 1 milestone **"General level — by the coset norm"** consumes: there the level-one formula
is applied to the norm `∏_{γ ∈ Γ \ SL₂(ℤ)} f ∣[k] γ`, and each level-one weight `1 / e_P` is
redistributed over the `Γ`-orbits inside the `SL₂(ℤ)`-orbit of `P` by a stabiliser count. Only
in the uniform form is there a single weight per orbit to redistribute.

## Main declarations

* `valence_formula` (in `EpsilonEridani.ModularForm`): the valence formula.
* `EpsilonEridani.ModularForm.valence_formula_weighted`: the uniform form.
* `EpsilonEridani.ModularForm.twelve_mul_orderOfVanishingOnOrbit_le_weight_mul_ellipticOrder`: the
  resulting bound
  `12 · ord_P f ≤ k · e_P` on a single orbit, and
  `EpsilonEridani.ModularForm.orderOfVanishingOnOrbit_eq_zero_of_weight_mul_ellipticOrder_lt_twelve`,
  the vanishing-order-zero conclusion it forces when `k · e_P < 12`.

with its `h_core` hypothesis discharged by the contour development rather than assumed.

/-! ### The uniform form, weighted by the elliptic orders -/

/-- **The valence formula, uniformly over the orbit space.** For a nonzero weight-`k` modular
form on `SL₂(ℤ)`, weighting each orbit by the reciprocal of its elliptic order,

`∑_{P ∈ SL₂(ℤ) \ ℍ} (1 / e_P) · ord_P f + ord_∞ f = k / 12`.

This is `valence_formula` with the two exceptional orbits absorbed into the general weight:
`e_i = 2` and `e_ρ = 3` restore the `1/2` and the `1/3`, and `e_P = 1` elsewhere makes every
other orbit count once. It is the form the general-level formula redistributes along the norm
map, where a single weight per orbit is what a stabiliser count can split. -/

nonzero, this says that `f` does not vanish there; the statement also covers the zero form under
