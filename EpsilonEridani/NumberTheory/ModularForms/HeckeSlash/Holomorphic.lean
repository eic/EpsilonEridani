# The slash sum preserves holomorphy

`heckeSlashSum` is a finite sum of slashes, so it is holomorphic whenever its argument is. This
is one of the two conditions separating `SlashInvariantForm` from `ModularForm`; the other,
boundedness at the cusps, is not addressed here.

Holomorphy is one of the two conditions a `ModularForm` carries over a `SlashInvariantForm`. A
consumer building the descent needs this together with boundedness at the cusps; only the former
is available here, and nothing in this file assumes `f` is slash-invariant, so it applies to any
holomorphic `f : ℍ → ℂ`.

## Main results

* `HeckeRing.GL2.mdifferentiable_heckeSlashSum`: `heckeSlashSum k D f` is holomorphic when `f` is.

(`heckeSlashSum_slash_invariant`) this supplies one of the two extra conditions a
