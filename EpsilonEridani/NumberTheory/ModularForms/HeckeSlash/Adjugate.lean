# The adjugates of the Hecke coset representatives

`HeckeRing.GL2.heckeSlashSum` sums `f ∣[k] aᵥ` over `aᵥ = rightCosetRep D v = δ τᵥ⁻¹`, where `δ`
represents the double coset and `τᵥ` runs over `Γ₂ ⧸ (Γ₂ ∩ δ⁻¹Γ₁δ)`. Moving that sum across the
Petersson pairing replaces each `aᵥ` by its main involution `aᵥ^ι = adjugateGL aᵥ`
(`UpperHalfPlane.peterssonInner_sum_slash_left_adjugateGL`), and the resulting pairing is an
integral of `g ∣[k] aᵥ^ι` over a translate of a fundamental domain — one integrand per `v`.

This file records the fact that collapses those integrands to one. The adjugate is
*anti*-multiplicative, so

```text
aᵥ^ι = (δ τᵥ⁻¹)^ι = (τᵥ⁻¹)^ι δ^ι = τᵥ δ^ι
```

as soon as `τᵥ` has determinant one, and the left factor lies in `Γ₂`. A function invariant under
the weight-`k` slash action of that factor therefore does not see it:
`g ∣[k] aᵥ^ι = g ∣[k] δ^ι` for every `v`. That is exactly the constancy hypothesis of
`UpperHalfPlane.peterssonInner_sum_slash_left_adjugateGL_biUnion`, which is what lets the
translated pairings reassemble into a single one.

## Main results

* `HeckeRing.GL2.adjugateGL_rightCosetRep`: `aᵥ^ι = τᵥ δ^ι`, the adjugate of a right-coset
  representative split off from the adjugate of the double-coset representative.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.slash_adjugateGL_rightCosetRep`: consequently `g ∣[k] aᵥ^ι = g ∣[k] δ^ι` for a
  `g` invariant under `τᵥ`, independent of `v`.

Both are stated at a single `v`, with the determinant and invariance hypotheses asked of `τᵥ`
alone. A caller quantifying over `v` — which is what the aggregate identity needs — supplies them
from whatever it knows about `Γ₂`, and `HeckeCoset` itself puts no condition on its subgroups.

  `HeckeRIngs/GL2/AdjointTheory/SummandAdjoint.lean` proves the corresponding statements
  (`slash_peterssonAdj_glMap_T_p_upper_eq_slash_T_p_lower`, :716, and its `M_∞` companion) for the
  concrete `Tₚ` family on `Γ₁(N)`, one matrix at a time. Here the double coset is abstract, so the
  anti-multiplicativity of the adjugate does the work that explicit matrices do there.

/-- **The adjugate of a right-coset representative peels off a `Γ₂`-element on the left.** The
adjugate is anti-multiplicative and inverts a determinant-one matrix, so
`(δ τᵥ⁻¹)^ι = τᵥ · δ^ι`.

The determinant hypothesis is asked of `τᵥ` alone, not of `Γ₂`: the statement is about one `v`,
and `HeckeCoset` puts no condition on its subgroups. A caller quantifying over `v` supplies it

This is the constancy that
