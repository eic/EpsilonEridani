# The slash sum of an invariant function depends only on the double coset

`heckeSlashSum k D f` is a sum over the *chosen* representatives `D.out` of the double coset and
`v.out` of its right cosets, and `HeckeSlash/Basic.lean` records that on a general `f : ℍ → ℂ`
the value moves with those choices. This file proves that for a `Γ₁`-invariant `f` it does not:
the sum is `∑ᵢ f ∣[k] aᵢ` for **any** family `(aᵢ)` of representatives of the right cosets of
`Γ₁ δ Γ₂`, whatever `δ` in the double coset and whatever representatives are used to name them.

That is what makes the endomorphisms of `HeckeSlash/ModularForm.lean` operators attached to the
double coset rather than to a presentation of it, and it is Shimura's definition (§3.4, (3.4.1)),
which fixes no representatives at all.

## What the choice-freeness rests on

Two families of representatives of the same right cosets differ, coset by coset, by a factor of
`Γ₁` on the **left**, and `f ∣[k] (γ₁ x) = (f ∣[k] γ₁) ∣[k] x = f ∣[k] x` for `γ₁ ∈ Γ₁` when `f`
is `Γ₁`-invariant: that is `slash_eq_of_rightCoset_eq`, and it is the only place invariance is
used. Everything else is a comparison of two enumerations of the same finite set of right
cosets: `DoubleCoset.doubleCoset_eq_iUnion_rightCosets` says the chosen representatives cover
the double coset and `DoubleCoset.op_mul_out_inv_smul_injective` says they do so without
repetition, which are exactly the two hypotheses demanded of the family `(aᵢ)`, so the two
enumerations are matched by a bijection and the sums agree term by term.

The hypotheses are stated with `MulOpposite.op x • (Γ₁ : Set _)` — Mathlib's spelling of the
right coset `Γ₁ x` — so that the two lemmas above are literally what a caller supplies. The
double coset `Γ₁ δ Γ₂` is named as `doubleCoset (D.out : GL (Fin 2) ℚ) Γ₁ Γ₂`; that *set*
depends on no choice, since `DoubleCoset.doubleCoset_eq_of_mem` gives the same set for every
`δ` in it, and `heckeSlashSum_eq_sum_of_mem_doubleCoset` is the resulting statement that any
such `δ` may be used to form the sum.

## Repetition, and where it comes from

`heckeSlashSum_eq_sum_of_rightCosets` asks its family to name each right coset exactly once. The
composite of two slash sums does not: `heckeSlashSum_heckeSlashSum_eq_sum_of_rightCosets`
(`HeckeSlash/Composition.lean`) presents that composite as a sum over *pairs* of representatives,
and the products `aᵢ bⱼ` landing in one double coset name each of its right cosets not once but a
fixed number of times — Shimura's multiplicity, by
`DoubleCoset.card_pairs_mem_rightCoset_eq_multiplicity` and
`DoubleCoset.card_pairs_mem_rightCoset_congr`. So the last statement below trades injectivity for
that uniform repetition count and concludes a multiple of the slash sum, which is the form each
double coset contributes to the multiplicity-weighted composite `∑_D m(D₁, D₂; D) · T_D`.

## Main results

* `HeckeRing.GL2.slash_eq_of_rightCoset_eq`: slashing a `Γ₁`-invariant function by `x` depends
  only on the right coset `Γ₁ x`.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.heckeSlashSum_eq_sum_of_rightCosets`: **the choice-free description of the
  slash sum.** For `Γ₁`-invariant `f`, `heckeSlashSum k D f = ∑ᵢ f ∣[k] aᵢ` for any family
  `(aᵢ)` whose right cosets `Γ₁ aᵢ` are distinct and cover the double coset.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.heckeSlashSum_eq_sum_of_mem_doubleCoset`: the special case that fixes the
  choice of double-coset representative only: any `δ ∈ Γ₁ D.out Γ₂` gives the same sum.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.sum_slash_eq_nsmul_heckeSlashSum`: **the weighted collapse.** A family naming
  each right coset of the double coset exactly `m` times — repetitions allowed, covering not
  assumed — sums to `m • heckeSlashSum k D f`.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.sum_slash_coe_eq_nsmul_heckeSlashSum`: the weighted collapse for a form,
  whose slash-invariance discharges `hf`.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.heckeSlashSum_coe_eq_sum_of_rightCosets`: the same description for a form of
  level `G.map (mapGL ℝ)`, whose slash-invariance discharges the hypothesis `hf`. It is what
  `HeckeSlash/ModularForm.lean` reads off the two exported endomorphisms with, in
  `coe_heckeSlashModularFormEnd_eq_sum` and `coe_heckeSlashCuspFormEnd_eq_sum`.

/-- **Two families of representatives of the same right cosets are matched by a bijection.**
If the cosets `Γ₁ aᵢ` are pairwise distinct and cover `Γ₁ D.out Γ₂`, then the index type `ι` is
matched with `DecompQuotient Γ₂ Γ₁ (D.out)⁻¹` — the index `heckeSlashSum` sums over — by a
bijection `φ` carrying each `Γ₁ aᵢ` to `Γ₁ (rightCosetRep D (φ i))`.

This is pure coset bookkeeping: no slash, no weight and no character appears. It identifies the
two index sets compatibly with the cosets they name, and only that: the matched representatives
`aᵢ` and `rightCosetRep D (φ i)` differ by a factor of `Γ₁`, so a summand that can see the
representative still distinguishes them. Equating the two sums needs, in addition, a summand
depending only on the coset — for a slash term, `slash_eq_of_rightCoset_eq` on a
`Γ₁`-invariant `f`. -/

coset into right cosets.** If the right cosets `Γ₁ aᵢ` are pairwise distinct and cover
`Γ₁ D.out Γ₂`, then `heckeSlashSum k D f = ∑ᵢ f ∣[k] aᵢ`.

So the operator is attached to the double coset itself: the representatives `D.out` and `v.out`
that `heckeSlashSum` happens to pick are one such family (`doubleCoset_eq_iUnion_rightCosets` and
`op_mul_out_inv_smul_injective`), and every other family gives the same function.

Invariance of `f` under `Γ₁` is what the proof uses, once, through
`slash_eq_of_rightCoset_eq`; on a general `f` the statement is false, as `HeckeSlash/Basic.lean`
records. -/

The hypothesis counts indices by the coset they name and the conclusion counts them by their

Like `exists_bijective_rightCosetRep_smul_eq` this is pure coset bookkeeping — no slash, no
weight and no character appears. It is the counting half of the multiplicity-weighted collapse:
each fibre has `m` elements. Reaching `m •` a single slash sum needs the other half too — that
the terms on a fibre agree, which is `slash_eq_of_rightCoset_eq` on a `Γ₁`-invariant `f`. -/

/-- **A family naming each right coset the same number of times sums to a multiple of the slash
sum.** In place of the injectivity of `heckeSlashSum_eq_sum_of_rightCosets`, ask that every right
coset of the double coset be named by exactly `m` members of the family: then the sum over the
family is `m • heckeSlashSum k D f`.

Covering is not a hypothesis. A right coset named by no member forces `m = 0`, and then both
sides vanish; for `m ≠ 0` the family does cover, so nothing is lost by leaving it out and a user
holding only a set of products need not prove it.

This is the shape the composite of two slash sums arrives in. Grouping the products `aᵢ bⱼ` of
`heckeSlashSum_heckeSlashSum_eq_sum_of_rightCosets` by the double coset they lie in, the group
belonging to one double coset meets each of that coset's right cosets the same number of times
(`DoubleCoset.card_pairs_mem_rightCoset_congr`), and that common count is Shimura's multiplicity
(`DoubleCoset.card_pairs_mem_rightCoset_eq_multiplicity`) — so each group contributes
