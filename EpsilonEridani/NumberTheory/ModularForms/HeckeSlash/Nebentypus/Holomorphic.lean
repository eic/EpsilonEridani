# The twisted slash sum of a holomorphic function is holomorphic

`HeckeSlash/Holomorphic.lean` proves `mdifferentiable_heckeSlashSum` for the unweighted sum.
This file is the nebentypus-twisted counterpart.

The twisted sum runs over the *same* slashes as the unweighted one, each scaled by the constant
`nebentypusWeight χ D v`. Holomorphy is closed under scaling by a constant, so no property of
the character is used here — only that its value is a scalar — and the proof is the untwisted
one with `MDifferentiable.const_smul` inserted at the summand.

## Main results

* `HeckeRing.GL2.mdifferentiable_twistedHeckeSlashSum`: the twisted slash sum of a holomorphic
  function is holomorphic.

/-- **The twisted slash sum of a holomorphic function is holomorphic.** Together with the twisted
invariance of `HeckeSlash/Nebentypus/Invariance.lean` this supplies one of the two extra
conditions a `ModularForm` carries over a `SlashInvariantForm`; boundedness at the cusps is
`isBoundedAt_twistedHeckeSlashSum`. -/
