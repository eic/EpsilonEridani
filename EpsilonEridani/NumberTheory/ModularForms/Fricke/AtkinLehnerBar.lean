# The Atkin–Lehner bar is the adjugate, conjugated by the Fricke matrix

Two different matrices in this development are called "Atkin–Lehner". The Hecke-ring
anti-involution of `EpsilonEridani/NumberTheory/HeckeRing/GL2/Gamma0/AtkinLehner.lean` conjugates a
transpose by the *diagonal* `w = diag(1, N)`, and the Fricke matrix of
`EpsilonEridani/NumberTheory/ModularForms/Fricke/Matrix.lean` is `W = !![0, -1; N, 0]`. Both of those
files record that the two matrices are different; neither says how they are related. This file
says how.

The relation is that conjugating the bar by `W` deletes the transpose and leaves the adjugate:

`adjugate x = W · bar x · W⁻¹`.

Nothing here is deep — in size two, `adjugate` is itself a conjugated transpose, `adjugate g =
J · gᵀ · J⁻¹` for `J = !![0, -1; 1, 0]`, so bar and adjugate differ by conjugation by `J · w⁻¹`,
and that matrix is `W` up to a scalar, which conjugation does not see. What the identity buys is
a translation: the Petersson adjoint produces `adjugateGL`, the `α ↦ (det α) · α⁻¹` involution of
`EpsilonEridani/NumberTheory/ModularForms/SlashAdjugate.lean`, while the Hecke ring's commutativity
argument is phrased in the bar. The two layers can now be moved between.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.adjugateGL_eq_frickeGL_conj_bar`: `adjugate x = W · bar x · W⁻¹` for `x ∈ Δ₀(N)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.bar_eq_inv_frickeGL_conj_adjugateGL`: the same read the other way,
  `bar x = W⁻¹ · adjugate x · W`.

/-- **The Atkin–Lehner bar is the adjugate, conjugated by the Fricke matrix**:
`adjugate x = W · bar x · W⁻¹`, where `W = !![0, -1; N, 0]`.

The two "Atkin–Lehner" matrices of this development are the diagonal `w = diag(1, N)`, which
conjugates the transpose to give the Hecke-ring bar, and `W`, the Fricke matrix. Since in size
two the adjugate is itself a conjugated transpose, the bar and the adjugate differ by a single
conjugation, and this identifies it. -/
