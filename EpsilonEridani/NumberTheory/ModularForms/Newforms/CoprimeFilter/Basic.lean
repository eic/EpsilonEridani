# Coprime-index filters on `S_k(Γ₁(N), χ)`

Miyake's Lemma 4.6.5: a cusp form `f ∈ S_k(Γ₁(N), χ)` can be *filtered* at a divisor of the
level. For a nonzero `L` all of whose primes already divide `N`, there is a cusp form `g` at a
raised level, again with nebentypus `χ` read there, whose `q`-expansion keeps exactly the
coefficients at indices coprime to `L`:

`aₙ(g) = aₙ(f)` when `(n, L) = 1`, and `aₙ(g) = 0` otherwise.

Only the *primes* of `L` do any filtering, so the level `g` lives at is `∏ L.primeFactors`
times `N`. For squarefree `L` that product is `L` itself, which is the level `L * N` at which
Miyake states the lemma.

Subtracting that filter from `f` leaves the complementary *`h`-form*. Under the same hypothesis
on `L` it costs nothing extra, landing at the same `∏ L.primeFactors * N`. For an arbitrary
nonzero `L` — neither squarefree, nor with its primes dividing `N` — one further raise is
needed: reading `f` at `∏ L.primeFactors * N` makes the primes of `L` divide the level, and
filtering there costs a further `∏ L.primeFactors`, for `∏ L.primeFactors * (∏ L.primeFactors * N)`.
The construction never lowers a level.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_mem_cuspFormCharSpace_qExpansion_coeff_eq_ite_coprime`: the filter, for a nonzero
  `L` whose primes divide `N`, at level `∏ L.primeFactors * N`.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_mem_cuspFormCharSpace_qExpansion_coeff_eq_ite_coprime_of_squarefree`:
  Miyake's Lemma 4.6.5 as stated, for a squarefree `L` whose primes divide `N`, at level
  `L * N`.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_mem_cuspFormCharSpace_qExpansionSupportedOnDvd`: for an `f` vanishing at every
  index coprime to `p * L`, the filter is additionally **supported on the multiples of `p`** — the
  hypothesis the Atkin–Lehner descent consumes — with
  `EpsilonEridani.exists_mem_cuspFormCharSpace_qExpansionSupportedOnDvd_of_squarefree` its squarefree
  specialization at level `L * N`.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_mem_cuspFormCharSpace_qExpansion_coeff_eq_ite_coprime_zero`: the complementary
  filter, under the filter's own hypothesis and at its own level — a nonzero `L` whose primes
  divide `N`, at level `∏ L.primeFactors * N`.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_mem_cuspFormCharSpace_qExpansion_coeff_eq_ite_coprime_zero_prod_primeFactors_sq`:
  the `h`-form, the complementary filter for an arbitrary nonzero `L`, at level
  `∏ L.primeFactors * (∏ L.primeFactors * N)`, which divides `N * L ^ 2` and equals it exactly
  when `L` is squarefree.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_mem_cuspFormCharSpace_qExpansion_coeff_eq_ite_coprime_zero_mul_sq`: that same
  `h`-form read at Miyake's classical level `N * L ^ 2`, also for an arbitrary nonzero `L`.

## Implementation notes

The construction is one prime at a time. At a single `p` the witness is `f - V_p (T_p f)`, read
at level `p * N`; the `q`-expansion identities `EpsilonEridani.CuspForm.qExpansion_levelRaise_coeff_Gamma1`
and `HeckeRing.GL2.qExpansion_coeff_heckeTCuspNat_of_primeFactors_subset` make the two
contributions cancel at exactly the indices divisible by `p`. Neither of those needs `p` to be
prime, only that its prime factors already divide the level, so the single-`p` step is stated
at that generality; primality is used only to compose the filters, where
`Nat.Coprime n (q * m)` has to split as `¬ q ∣ n` and `Nat.Coprime n m`.

Iterating over `L.primeFactors` raises the level by one prime per step, so the induction is on
the number of primes left to peel and the level it lands at is existentially quantified, with
the equation `M' = ∏ S * M` recorded alongside. That keeps the recursion free of any transport
along an equality of levels: the caller substitutes the equation once, at a concrete level.

The `h`-form adds no peeling of its own. Under the filter's own hypothesis on `L` it is just the
subtraction, performed where the filter already lives, so only `f` is moved, along
`CuspForm.ofLe`, and the level is unchanged at `∏ L.primeFactors * N`; that is the general
statement. The arbitrary-`L` form is its instance after one more raise: the filter needs the
primes of `L` to divide the level it works over, which for an arbitrary `L` they need not, and
reading `f` at `∏ L.primeFactors * N` first is what supplies that — `∏ L.primeFactors` has
exactly the primes of `L`, so it is the uniform raise the construction uses for every `L`, and it
is why the level lands at `∏ L.primeFactors * (∏ L.primeFactors * N)` rather than at
`∏ L.primeFactors * (L * N)`. It is not minimal: only the primes of `L` absent from `N` are
needed, and when all of them already divide `N` no raise is required at all — that case is the
filter's own hypothesis.
Neither statement is made at a level fixed in advance, so no equation of levels is transported.
Since `∏ L.primeFactors ∣ L`, that level divides `N * L ^ 2`, with equality exactly when `L` is
squarefree; reading the `h`-form at the classical `N * L ^ 2` is a `CuspForm.ofLe` along that
divisibility, which is the transport the rest of the file uses anyway.

## Provenance

Adapted from AINTLIB's `StrongMultiplicityOne/LevelChangeCharSpace.lean` (see References): the
declarations `miyake_4_6_5_single_prime_dvd_N` and `miyake_4_6_5_iterated_L` with their two
`q`-expansion and `ite`-composition helpers. Deliberate differences from the source: the
source's `hp : p.Prime` is dropped from the single-`p` step and from the `q`-expansion
cancellation, neither proof using it; the `Squarefree (∏ S)` hypothesis the source threads
through the recursion only to feed itself disappears once the conclusion is stated at the level
`∏ S * M`; the filter is stated here for a nonzero, not-necessarily-squarefree `L` whose primes
divide `N`, and the `h`-form for an arbitrary nonzero `L`, the source stating only squarefree
forms at this stage (its `_general` variant generalizes the target level, not `L`). The `h`-form
in particular is not built by a second recursion: in its general form it is one subtraction at
the filter's own level, and each wider-`L` form adds a single `CuspForm.ofLe` on top of it.

`exists_mem_cuspFormCharSpace_qExpansionSupportedOnDvd` and its squarefree specialization state
AINTLIB's `miyake_g_p_supported`, which lives in
`StrongMultiplicityOne/DescentCosets.lean` at the same pinned commit and license. The source
states it for a squarefree `l'` and concludes membership in its `qSupportedOnDvdSubmodule`; here
the general nonzero-`L` form is the primary statement, the conclusion is the
`QExpansionSupportedOnDvd` predicate this repository already uses, and the squarefree form is
derived from it rather than proved separately.

`coprime_prod_primeFactors_iff` is AINTLIB's `coprime_prod_primeFactors_iff_coprime`, which
lives one file up in `StrongMultiplicityOne.lean`. It is restated here for an arbitrary nonzero
`L` rather than for the ambient level, and proved from `Nat.dvd_prod_primeFactors_pow_self`
instead of by contradiction on a common prime divisor.

The `h`-form corresponds to `miyake_h_form_general` in the same source file, but shares none of
its proof. The source reaches the prescribed level `N * L ^ 2` by a *second* recursion over the
primes of `L`, carried at a level fixed in advance — the `miyake_4_6_5_single_prime_coprime_to_N`
/ `miyake_4_6_5_iterated_helper_general` / `miyake_4_6_5_iterated_L_general` chain, with its
`dvd_conditions_*` side conditions and its `Eq.ndrec` cast along `p * (p * N) = N * p ^ 2`.
Here there is no second recursion: the `h`-form applies the filter already proved above and
subtracts at the level that filter lands on, moving only `f` along `CuspForm.ofLe`, so the whole
prescribed-level apparatus of the source disappears. The source's target level `N * L ^ 2`
survives as a statement in its own right, but not as a squarefree one: it is
`exists_mem_cuspFormCharSpace_qExpansion_coeff_eq_ite_coprime_zero_mul_sq`, the arbitrary-`L`
`h`-form read along `∏ L.primeFactors * (∏ L.primeFactors * N) ∣ N * L ^ 2` by a single
`CuspForm.ofLe`, where the source casts with `Eq.ndrec`. Squarefreeness is not a hypothesis
anywhere in the `h`-form chain; it is only the case in which that divisibility happens to be
an equality. The final `q`-expansion computation uses
`ModularForm.qExpansion_sub` directly in place of the source's `sub_eq_add_neg` rewriting
through `qExpansion_add` and `qExpansion_neg`.

equality exactly when `L` is squarefree. `N * L ^ 2` is the level at which Miyake states the
lemma. -/

/-- **The filter of a form vanishing off `p · L` is supported on the multiples of `p`.** If
`f ∈ S_k(Γ₁(N), χ)` has `aₙ(f) = 0` at every `n` coprime to `p · L`, then its coprime-to-`L`
filter — the cusp form of level `∏ L.primeFactors * N` that
`EpsilonEridani.exists_mem_cuspFormCharSpace_qExpansion_coeff_eq_ite_coprime` produces — satisfies
`QExpansionSupportedOnDvd p`.

`QExpansionSupportedOnDvd p g` is the hypothesis of
`EpsilonEridani.mem_cuspFormsOld_of_qExpansionSupportedOnDvd`, so this is what carries the coprime filter
into the level-lowering dichotomy. The hypotheses on `L` are the filter's own, unchanged; `p` need
not divide `N`, and no relation between `p` and `L` is assumed. -/
