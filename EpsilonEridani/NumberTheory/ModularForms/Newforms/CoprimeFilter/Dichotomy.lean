# The factor dichotomy of the coprime sieve

Let `f ∈ S_k(Γ₁(N), χ)` vanish at every index coprime to `p L`, for a prime `p ∣ N` and an
`L` coprime to `p` (so `L ≠ 0`) whose primes divide `N`. Either `f` already vanishes at every index
coprime to `L`, or the nebentypus `χ` factors through `N / p`. This is
the case split of Miyake's proof of Lemma 4.6.8 (the Main Lemma of Diamond–Shurman §5.7, per
character): the second case is what a later descent along `p` needs, and in the first the prime
`p` needs no descent at all.

The coprime filter of `f` (`Newforms/CoprimeFilter/Basic.lean`) is a form `G` of level `L' N`,
`L'` the product of the primes of `L`, carrying the coefficients of `f` at the indices coprime
to `L` and supported on the multiples of `p`; the level-lowering dichotomy
(`ConductorDichotomy.lean`) either finds `G` to be a level-raise from `L' N / p`, so that the
pulled-back character factors through `L' N / p` and, by the conductor
(`DirichletCharacter.factorsThrough_div_of_changeLevel_factorsThrough`), `χ` factors through
`N / p`, or forces `G = 0`, which is the required vanishing of the coefficients of `f` at the
indices coprime to `L`.

<https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB> @ `eb9621e7bcb0ce220ad53983ec45d987cb5b9002`),
`projects/LeanModularForms/LeanModularForms/StrongMultiplicityOne/InductiveStep.lean`,
`miyake_4_6_8_factor_dichotomy`. The source's private conductor lemmas
(`conductor_dvd_of_factorsThrough`, `factorsThrough_of_conductor_dvd`, `conductor_changeLevel`)
are Mathlib's `DirichletCharacter.conductor_dvd_of_mem_conductorSet`,
`mem_conductorSet_iff_conductor_dvd` and `conductor_changeLevel`; the source assumes `L`
squarefree, which the filter at the radical of `L` makes unnecessary.

/-- **The factor dichotomy.** For `f ∈ S_k(Γ₁(N), χ)` vanishing at every index coprime to `p L`,
with `p ∣ N` prime and `L` coprime to `p` with primes dividing `N`: either `f` vanishes at
every index coprime to `L`, or the nebentypus factors through `N / p`.

The second branch is stated with Mathlib's `DirichletCharacter.FactorsThrough`: its `χ₀`, `dvd`
and `eq_changeLevel` give a consumer the lowered character modulo `N / p` and the factorisation
of `χ` through it, which is what the descent lemmas take.
