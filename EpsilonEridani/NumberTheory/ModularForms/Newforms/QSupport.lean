# Cusp forms whose `q`-expansion is supported on multiples of `d`

A power series is *supported on multiples of `d`* when every coefficient at an index not
divisible by `d` vanishes. This is the coefficient condition behind the Atkin–Lehner description
of the old subspace, and this file bundles it on cusp forms: the forms of level `Γ₁(N)` whose
period-1 `q`-expansion satisfies it form a submodule, and the image of the level-raising operator
`V_d` lies inside it. That containment is the **forward inclusion**; the converse — that every
such form is in the image, which is what would make the description exact — is not proved here
and needs hypotheses this file does not carry.

Neither half of the underlying material is stated here. The power-series predicate is generic and
lives in `EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/PowerSeries/Support.lean`, from which this file pulls
`PowerSeries.supportedOnDvdSubmodule` back along the `q`-expansion; the fact that a level-raise
satisfies it is a statement about `V_d` and lives beside `V_d` in
`EpsilonEridani/NumberTheory/ModularForms/Degeneracy.lean`, as
`CuspForm.isSupportedOnDvd_qExpansion_levelRaise`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.QExpansionSupportedOnDvd`: the support condition on the period-1 `q`-expansion of a
  cusp form.
* `EpsilonEridani.qSupportedOnDvdSubmodule`: the cusp forms satisfying it, as the pullback of
  `PowerSeries.supportedOnDvdSubmodule` along the `q`-expansion.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.levelRaise_mem_qSupportedOnDvdSubmodule`: for `d * M ∣ N`, the operator `V_d` carries
  `S_k(Γ₁(M))` into the submodule — the forward half of the Atkin–Lehner description of the old
  subspace.
* `EpsilonEridani.range_levelRaise_le_qSupportedOnDvdSubmodule`: the same statement for the `ℂ`-linear
  map, which is the shape `EpsilonEridani.cuspFormsOld` is assembled from.
* `EpsilonEridani.iSup_range_levelRaise_le_qSupportedOnDvdSubmodule`: at a fixed `d`, the span of those
  ranges over **every** `M` with `d * M ∣ N` lies in the submodule.

The source reaches the same conclusion through a cast between cusp-form spaces at equal levels
(`castCuspFormLinearEquiv`, `castLevelRaise`); that scaffolding is not ported, because this
repository's `CuspForm.levelRaiseₗ` accepts the divisibility hypothesis directly via
`Gamma1_map_le_conjAct_scaleGL_of_dvd` and lands at `Γ₁(N)` with no cast — exactly as
`cuspFormsOld` itself does.

## Provenance

Adapted from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project (Chris Birkbeck,
`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0) at commit `2baa76f74`, file
`projects/LeanModularForms/LeanModularForms/Eigenforms/AtkinLehner.lean`, declarations
`QExpansionSupportedOnDvd`, `qSupportedOnDvdSubmodule` and
`levelRaise_mem_qSupportedOnDvdSubmodule`, with
`range_levelRaise_le_qSupportedOnDvdSubmodule` the cast-free form of the source's
`range_castLevelRaise_le_qSupportedOnDvdSubmodule`.

Two further declarations of the source, `qExpansion_modularFormLevelRaise_isSupportedOnDvd` and
`qExpansion_levelRaise_isSupportedOnDvd`, are in `Degeneracy.lean` as
`ModularForm.isSupportedOnDvd_qExpansion_levelRaise` and its cusp-form counterpart; the
underlying power-series predicate `PowerSeries.IsSupportedOnDvd` comes from the same source file
but is in `EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/PowerSeries/Support.lean`. Each carries its own AINTLIB
provenance where it lives — `Degeneracy.lean`'s References for the two `V_d` lemmas,
`Support.lean`'s Provenance for the predicate.

`qSupportedOnDvdSubmodule` is not a transcription: the source builds the submodule by hand,
discharging `zero_mem'`, `add_mem'` and `smul_mem'` from the predicate's closure lemmas, whereas
here it is the `comap` of `PowerSeries.supportedOnDvdSubmodule` along the `q`-expansion, so that
closure is inherited from the linearity already bundled into `ModularForm.qExpansionLinearMap`.

The source's `modularFormLevelRaise`/`levelRaise` name pair is this repository's
`ModularForm.levelRaise`/`CuspForm.levelRaise`, distinguished by namespace rather than by prefix.

The source keeps the predicate and its modular-form consequences in one file, inside its
`HeckeRing.GL2.AtkinLehner` namespace. Here the predicate is a statement about power series
alone and the level-raising statement belongs with `V_d`, so what the source keeps together is
split across three files.

This is deliberately *not* the fixed-`d` summand family of `EpsilonEridani.cuspFormsOld`: that one
carries the proper-level condition `M ≠ N`, which the supremum here does not, so at `d = 1` this
one includes `M = N` and hence the identity range. It is the wider statement, and it is what the
Atkin–Lehner Main Lemma consumes at a fixed `d > 1`. No bound of this kind holds for
`cuspFormsOld` itself, whose supremum also runs over `d = 1`, where `V₁` is restriction and
imposes no support condition. -/
