# Descent along a `q`-support condition

A cusp form of level `Γ₁(N)` whose period-one `q`-expansion is supported on the multiples of `l`
is `τ ↦ f (l τ)` for a function `f` invariant under the weight-`k` slash action of `T`.

This is the converse half of the Atkin–Lehner description of the old subspace: `QSupport.lean`
shows that a level-raise is `q`-supported on multiples of `l`, and this file recovers a
preimage from that support condition alone. The preimage is only a function — its invariance
under all of `Γ₁(N/l)` is what the conductor dichotomy goes on to establish — so the statement
is about `ℍ → ℂ`, and `Degeneracy.smul_slash_scaleGL_eq` is what phrases `τ ↦ f (l τ)` as the
renormalised slash `l ^ (1 - k) • (f ∣[k] diag(l, 1))` that `levelRaise` uses.

Invariance under `T` is where the support condition is spent: translating by `1 / l` multiplies
the `n`-th `q`-power by a primitive `l`-th root of unity raised to `n`, which is `1` exactly on
the multiples of `l`, and those are the only indices carrying a nonzero coefficient.

Neither the cusp condition nor the congruence level is used, and neither is the group. What the
argument asks of `g` is exactly what `UpperHalfPlane.hasSum_qExpansion` asks: that `g ∘ ofComplex`
have period `1`, that `g` be holomorphic, and that it be bounded at `i∞`. So the theorem is stated
for a bare `g : ℍ → ℂ` carrying those three hypotheses, and `Γ₁(N)` enters only in the cusp-form
specialisation, which supplies them from the form class — period `1` through
`EpsilonEridani.one_mem_strictPeriods_Gamma1_map`, and boundedness through the `Fact (IsCusp ∞ _)` that
`ModularFormClass.bdd_at_infty` asks for.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_eq_smul_slash_scaleGL_and_slash_T_eq_of_isSupportedOnDvd`: the descent, for any
  period-one holomorphic function bounded at `i∞`.
* `CuspForm.exists_eq_smul_slash_scaleGL_and_slash_T_eq_of_qExpansionSupportedOnDvd`: its `Γ₁(N)`
  specialisation to cusp forms, in the shape the Atkin–Lehner old-subspace argument consumes.

commit `2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08`,
`projects/LeanModularForms/LeanModularForms/HeckeRIngs/GL2/Newforms.lean` — the theorem
`exists_levelRaise_preimage_of_coeff_support_multiples` and its three private helpers. The
source's `levelRaiseMatrix l` is this repository's `scaleGL l` and its `levelRaiseFun l k f` is
`l ^ (1 - k) • (f ∣[k] scaleGL l)`, so neither is ported again. The source's `1 < l` and `l ∣ N`
hypotheses are dropped: neither is used, as the underscores on them record.
