# Restrictions of a finite normal layer, and its finite quotient system

Let `V ◁ U` be a finite normal layer of a formation, the layer `K/F` in field notation. Raising
the ground field to an intermediate field `F ⊆ E ⊆ K` leaves a layer `K/E`, again normal because
`V` stays normal in the smaller ground subgroup. Two layers are related by a **restriction** when
they have the same top subgroup and the ground subgroup of the first lies in the ground subgroup
of the second; `LayerRestriction small big` is that relation. Its **relative degree** is
`[U : U']`, the degree `[E : F]` of the new ground field over the old one. This convention is
intended to support the corestriction normalisation `cor ∘ res = [E : F]`; `⚠` it is the index
of the *sub*group `U'` in `U`, not the other way round.

Restrictions of a fixed layer are the same thing as subgroups of its Galois group: `U'` is
recovered from `H = U'/V ≤ Γ`, and this **finite quotient system** `H ↦ subgroupLayer H` is what
Tate's theorem quantifies over. The two directions of the correspondence appear below as
`NormalLayer.subgroupGround`, which builds the intermediate subgroup out of `H`, and
`NormalLayer.subgroupGalEquiv`, which identifies the Galois group of the resulting layer with `H`
again.

Three facts make the system usable in the cohomological arguments downstream. The Galois group of
the smaller layer maps to the Galois group of the bigger one (`LayerRestriction.galHom`), and does
so injectively; the degrees multiply along the restriction
(`LayerRestriction.degree_mul_relativeDegree`); and — because the two layers have the *same* top
subgroup, hence the same coefficient module `A^V` — the coefficient module of the smaller layer
*is* the coefficient module of the bigger one, restricted along `galHom`
(`LayerRestriction.repIso`). It is that last identification which lets a cohomology class of the
layer be restricted to a subgroup of its Galois group at all, and it is what
`LayerRestriction.cohomologyRes` feeds to Mathlib's change-of-group map to obtain

`H^n(U/V, A^V) ⟶ H^n(U'/V, A^V)`.

In degree zero this map is the inclusion `A^U ⊆ A^{U'}` of ground levels
(`LayerRestriction.groundLevelEquiv_cohomologyRes_zero_apply`), which is what fixes its direction.

Restrictions compose (`LayerRestriction.trans`), and along a tower `F ⊆ E ⊆ E' ⊆ K` the relative
degree is multiplicative, the homomorphisms of Galois groups compose, and restriction of
cohomology is functorial. Inside the finite quotient system the same tower structure is indexed by
an inclusion `K ≤ H` of subgroups of `Γ`, and a subgroup of the Galois group of the layer of `H`
gives back a layer of the system (`NormalLayer.subgroupLayer_subgroupLayer`), so a statement
quantified over all subgroups of `Γ` can be applied inside the layer of any one of them — which is
how Tate's theorem is used downstream.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.LayerRestriction`: the relation `small` is `big` with its ground field
  raised to an intermediate field.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.LayerRestriction.relativeDegree`: the relative degree `[U : U']`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.LayerRestriction.galHom`: the induced homomorphism `U'/V → U/V`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.LayerRestriction.repIso`: the coefficient module of the smaller layer
  is the coefficient module of the bigger layer, restricted along `galHom`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.LayerRestriction.trans`: the composite of two restrictions.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.LayerRestriction.cohomologyRes`: restriction of the cohomology of a
  layer along a restriction of layers.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.LayerRestriction.groundInclusion`: the inclusion `A^U ⊆ A^{U'}` of
  ground levels, the degree-zero shadow of `cohomologyRes`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.subgroupGround`: the intermediate open subgroup attached
  to a subgroup of the Galois group.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.subgroupLayer`: the layer of a subgroup of the Galois
  group, and `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.subgroupRestriction`, the restriction relating
  it to the layer it comes from.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.subgroupGalEquiv`: the Galois group of that layer is the
  chosen subgroup.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.LayerRestriction.galHom_injective`: the Galois group of the smaller
  layer embeds in the Galois group of the bigger one.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.LayerRestriction.degree_mul_relativeDegree`:
  `[U' : V] * [U : U'] = [U : V]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.degree_subgroupLayer`: the layer of `H` has degree `#H`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.relativeDegree_subgroupRestriction`: its relative degree
  is the index of `H`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.galHom_subgroupRestriction`: the homomorphism of Galois
  groups it induces is the inclusion of `H`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.subgroupLayer_top`: the layer of the whole Galois group is
  the layer itself.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.LayerRestriction.relativeDegree_trans` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.LayerRestriction.galHom_trans`: the relative degree is multiplicative
  and the homomorphisms of Galois groups compose along a tower of restrictions.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.LayerRestriction.cohomologyRes_trans`: restriction of cohomology is
  functorial along a tower of restrictions.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.LayerRestriction.groundInclusion_trans`: ground-level inclusions
  compose along a tower of restrictions.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.LayerRestriction.groundLevelEquiv_cohomologyRes_zero_apply`: in degree
  zero, restriction of cohomology is the ground-level inclusion.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.relativeDegree_subgroupLayerRestriction`: the relative
  degree of a tower `K ≤ H` inside the finite quotient system is the relative index of `K` in `H`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.subgroupLayer_subgroupLayer`: the layer of a subgroup of
  the Galois group of the layer of `H` is again a layer of the system.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.subgroupLayer_range_galHom`: conversely, every restriction
  of `L` is the layer of a subgroup of its Galois group.

## Implementation notes

`LayerRestriction` is a relation between two layers that already exist, not a bundle carrying a
layer and constructing a second one. This is what lets the downstream restriction and
corestriction maps be stated for an arbitrary pair `small`, `big` of layers, and it makes towers
of restrictions compose without transporting a layer along an equality. Because it is a `Prop`,
the relative degree cannot be read off the datum itself: `relativeDegree` is a function of the two
layers, and takes the restriction proof to make that dependency explicit and support the notation
`T.relativeDegree`.

`NormalLayer.subgroupGround` is the correspondence-theorem preimage of `H` — the subgroup
`QuotientGroup.comapMk'OrderIso` attaches to `H` — pushed from `U` into the ambient group `G`, so
that it can be an `OpenSubgroup G` and be compared with the other subgroups of a formation.
