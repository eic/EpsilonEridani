# Power series over the `p`-adic integers: evaluation and division by `X - c`

An arbitrary power series `ψ ∈ ℤ_[p]⟦X⟧` can be evaluated at a `p`-adic integer `c` exactly when
`p ∣ c`: this is the condition `PowerSeries.HasEval c`, which for `ℤ_[p]` is topological
nilpotence (`EpsilonEridani.Huber.PadicInt.isTopologicallyNilpotent_iff_dvd`), and `ψ ↦ ψ(c)` is then
Mathlib's continuous `ℤ_[p]`-algebra homomorphism `PowerSeries.aeval : ℤ_[p]⟦X⟧ →ₐ[ℤ_[p]] ℤ_[p]`,
given by the convergent sum of the monomials (`PowerSeries.hasSum_aeval`). The linear topology
on `ℤ_[p]` that this evaluation needs is `EpsilonEridani.Huber.PadicInt.instIsLinearTopology`. For such
`c`, division by `X - c` is `ψ = (X - c) * q + ψ(c)` with the explicit quotient
`PowerSeries.divXSubC`, whose `n`-th coefficient is the convergent series `∑ₖ ψ_{n+1+k} c^k`, so a
power series is divisible by `X - c` exactly when it vanishes at `c`: this is the special case of
Weierstrass division that produces the basis corrections in Labute's classification of Demushkin
groups, and the specialisation to `ℤ_[p]` and its maximal ideal `(p)` of the results of
`EpsilonEridani.RingTheory.PowerSeries.Evaluation`.

## Main results

* `PadicInt.X_sub_C_mul_divXSubC_add_C_aeval`: for `p ∣ c`, `ψ = (X - C c) * q + C (ψ(c))` with
  the explicit quotient `q = PowerSeries.divXSubC _ ψ`.
* `PadicInt.X_sub_C_mul_divXSubC`: for `p ∣ c` and `ψ(c) = 0`, `ψ = (X - C c) * q`.
* `PadicInt.X_sub_C_dvd_iff_aeval_eq_zero`: for `p ∣ c`, `(X - C c) ∣ ψ ↔ ψ(c) = 0`.
