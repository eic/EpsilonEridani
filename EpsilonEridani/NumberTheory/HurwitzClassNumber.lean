# Hurwitz class numbers

The Hurwitz class number `H D` of a natural number `D` counts the positive-definite integral binary
quadratic forms `a x² + b x y + c y²` of discriminant `b² - 4 a c = -D` up to
`SL₂(ℤ)`-equivalence, where the classes of the multiples of `x² + y²` count with weight `1/2` and
those of the multiples of `x² + x y + y²` with weight `1/3`, and where `H 0 = -1/12`. These are
the class numbers that enter the Eichler–Selberg trace formula for the Hecke operators on
`S_k(SL₂(ℤ))`.

Here `H D` is *defined* combinatorially, as a weighted count of the **reduced** forms
`EpsilonEridani.reducedForms D` of `EpsilonEridani.NumberTheory.BinaryQuadraticForm.Reduced`: those with
`|b| ≤ a ≤ c`, and with `0 ≤ b` whenever `|b| = a` or `a = c`. Every positive-definite form is
equivalent to exactly one reduced form, so the count is the class count; that comparison is
separate. The definition involves no class groups, and it is a finite, decidable sum.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.reducedFormWeight f`: the weight `1/2`, `1/3` or `1` with which a reduced form counts.
* `EpsilonEridani.hurwitzClassNumber D`: the Hurwitz class number `H D`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.hurwitzClassNumber_eq_zero_of_mod_four_eq_one_or_two`: `H D = 0` when
  `D ≡ 1, 2 (mod 4)`, since a discriminant `b² - 4 a c` is `0` or `1` modulo `4`
  (`Int.discrim_emod_four`).
* The first values `H 3 = 1/3`, `H 4 = 1/2`, `H 7 = 1`, `H 8 = 1`, `H 12 = 4/3` and `H 16 = 3/2`,
  the last two exercising the two weights on non-primitive forms.
