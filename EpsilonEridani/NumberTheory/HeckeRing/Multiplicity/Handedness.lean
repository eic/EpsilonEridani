# Right-coset collisions and the handedness of Shimura's multiplicity

`DoubleCoset.multiplicity Γ₁ Γ₂ Γ₃ g h d` counts the pairs of representatives of the *left*-coset
decompositions `Γ₁ g Γ₂ = ⊔ᵢ σᵢ g Γ₂` and `Γ₂ h Γ₃ = ⊔ⱼ τⱼ h Γ₃` whose product lies in the left
coset `d Γ₃`. A slash sum runs instead over the *right*-coset decomposition
`Γ₁ δ Γ₂ = ⊔ᵥ Γ₁ (δ τᵥ⁻¹)`, so composing two slash sums produces a count of pairs whose product
lies in a *right* coset `Γ₁ d`. This file identifies the two counts.

Inversion is an anti-automorphism carrying `Γ₁ δ Γ₂` to `Γ₂ δ⁻¹ Γ₁` and right cosets to left
cosets, and it carries the product `(δ₁ τᵥ⁻¹) (δ₂ σ_w⁻¹)` of two right-coset representatives to
`(σ_w δ₂⁻¹) (τᵥ δ₁⁻¹)`, which is exactly the product `multiplicity` counts — with the two factors
*exchanged*. So

`#{(v, w) | (δ₁ τᵥ⁻¹) (δ₂ σ_w⁻¹) ∈ Γ₁ d} = m_{Γ₃ Γ₂ Γ₁}(δ₂⁻¹, δ₁⁻¹; d⁻¹)`.

The exchange of factors is not an artefact of the proof: it is the same order reversal that makes
the action of a Hecke ring on modular forms an *anti*-homomorphism.

Nothing here mentions a slash action, a weight or `GL (Fin 2) ℚ`: which right cosets the products
of representatives meet is a question about the group alone, so it is answered alongside the rest
of the multiplicity API rather than in a file about modular forms.

## Main results

* `DoubleCoset.card_pairs_mem_rightCoset_eq_multiplicity`: the right-coset collision count of a
  pair of right-coset decompositions is Shimura's multiplicity, with the factors exchanged and
  the arguments inverted.
* `DoubleCoset.card_pairs_mem_rightCoset_congr`: that count depends on the target only through
  its double coset — each right coset of a fixed double coset is hit the same number of times.

/-- **The right-coset collision count is Shimura's multiplicity.**

`δ₁ τᵥ⁻¹` runs over the representatives of the right cosets of `Γ₁ δ₁ Γ₂` and `δ₂ σ_w⁻¹` over
those of `Γ₂ δ₂ Γ₃`; the number of pairs whose product lands in the right coset `Γ₁ d` is the
multiplicity of `d⁻¹` for the *reversed* triple.

Both the exchange of the two factors and the inversion of all three arguments come from the same
source: inversion is an anti-automorphism, and it is what turns the right-coset index a slash sum
uses into the left-coset index `multiplicity` is defined with. -/

/-- **Each right coset of a fixed double coset is hit the same number of times.** The right-coset
collision count of `card_pairs_mem_rightCoset_eq_multiplicity` depends on the target `d` only
through the double coset `Γ₁ d Γ₃`.

This is the uniformity that turns the composite of two slash sums into a multiplicity-weighted
sum of slash sums: within one double coset every right coset contributes the same count, so that
count factors out. -/
