# The leading elementary-divisor vector of a Hecke monomial

Towards **Shimura's Theorem 3.20** at general `n`: the `p`-local Hecke ring `pLocalSubring` is
the polynomial ring `ℤ[X₁, …, Xₙ]` on the diagonal prime cosets `heckeGen k = T(1, …, 1, p, …, p)`.
The injectivity half is a leading-term argument. Multiplying double cosets multiplies their
elementary divisors "up to lower terms", so the monomial `∏ k, heckeGen k ^ e k` has a
distinguished term, the diagonal coset whose elementary divisors are the products of those of the
factors, and the argument is that this leading term determines the exponent vector `e`.

This file is the combinatorial half of that argument: the exponent vector `leadingExponent e` of
that distinguished diagonal — entry `i` counts, with multiplicity `e k`, the generators whose
diagonal carries `p` in position `i`, which are the `k` with `n - 1 - i ≤ k` — together with the
properties the leading-term argument consumes, above all that the exponents are recovered from it.

The vector is the suffix sums of `e` read from the last position backwards, and suffix sums are
Mathlib's `Fin.accumulate`, the device of the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials (the same
leading-term argument, for the elementary symmetric polynomials): `leadingExponent e` is
`Fin.accumulate n n e` precomposed with `Fin.rev`, the recovery of the exponents is
`Fin.accumulate_injective`, and the explicit inverse is `Fin.invAccumulate`.

Multiplying Hecke monomials adds their exponent vectors, so `leadingExponent` is bundled as an
`AddMonoidHom`, as `Fin.accumulate` itself is. Its `map_zero`, `map_add`, `map_sum` and `map_nsmul`
are then the generic ones: a product over a finite family of monomials, or a monomial raised to a
power, needs no lemma of its own here.

## Main definitions

* `HeckeRing.GLn.leadingExponent`: the exponent vector of the leading elementary-divisor diagonal
  of the Hecke monomial with exponents `e`, the suffix sums `i ↦ ∑ k ≥ n - 1 - i, e k`, as an
  additive homomorphism `(Fin n → ℕ) →+ (Fin n → ℕ)`.

## Main results

* `HeckeRing.GLn.leadingExponent_injective`: **the exponents of a Hecke monomial are recovered
  from its leading elementary-divisor vector** — `Fin.accumulate_injective` transported along
  `Fin.rev`.
* `HeckeRing.GLn.isDvdChain_primePowDiag_leadingExponent`: the vector is monotone
  (`HeckeRing.GLn.leadingExponent_monotone`), so the leading diagonal `T(p ^ leadingExponent e)`
  is a divisibility chain — for `0 < p` a canonical diagonal, by `primePowDiag_pos`.
* `HeckeRing.GLn.primePowDiag_leadingExponent_single`: on the generator `X k` the leading
  diagonal is `heckeGenDiag k` itself; `map_add` and `primePowDiag_add` then give the leading
  diagonal of a product of monomials as the product of theirs.
* `HeckeRing.GLn.sum_leadingExponent`: the weight `∑ k, (k + 1) * e k` of the leading diagonal —
  the exponent of its determinant `p ^ ∑ i, leadingExponent e i`, which is that determinant's
  `p`-adic valuation once `p` is prime.

## Implementation notes

The other half of the leading-term argument — that the leading coset occurs in the monomial with
coefficient `1` and every other coset of its support lies below it — is the triangular expansion,
and is not proved here. At `n = 1, 2` Theorem 3.20 is `PolynomialRing/Injective.lean`, by direct
computation with the leading coset `T(p ^ e 1, p ^ (e 0 + e 1))` written out; that computation is
not rerouted through this vector.

This is original work filling the general-`n` gap the roadmap records: the AINTLIB source
(`LeanModularForms/HeckeRIngs/GLn/PolynomialRing.lean`) proves Theorem 3.20 at `n = 1, 2` only and
has no general-`n` leading-term device.
