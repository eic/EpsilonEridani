# The degree of a constant diagonal double coset

A constant tuple `a = (c, ..., c)` has `natDiagGL n a` a scalar matrix, which is central in
`GL_n(ℚ)` and so normalizes `SL_n(ℤ)`; the double coset `T(c, ..., c)` is therefore a single
coset and `deg T(c, ..., c) = 1`, at every rank.

The rank-two computation `deg T(a₀, a₁) = [SL₂(ℤ) : Γ₀(a₁ / a₀)]`, which is not rank-general,
is in `EpsilonEridani/NumberTheory/HeckeRing/GL2/DiagonalCosetDegree.lean`.

## Main results

* `degree_diagCoset_const`: `deg T(c, ..., c) = 1`, at every rank and for every `c : ℕ` —
  unconditionally, since a non-positive entry sends `natDiagGL` to its junk value `1`, whose
  double coset is the identity.

Ported from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project
([`LeanModularForms/HeckeRIngs/GLn/Degree.lean`](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB),
Chris Birkbeck), keeping only the rank-general constant case; the rank-two
computation is split into `GL2/DiagonalCosetDegree.lean`.

/-- **The constant degree**: a constant diagonal matrix is scalar, hence central, so its
double coset is a single coset and `deg T(c, ..., c) = 1`.

The statement is unconditional in `c`: for `c = 0` the value comes from `natDiagGL`'s junk
branch, which is `1`, whose double coset is the identity — not from centrality. -/
