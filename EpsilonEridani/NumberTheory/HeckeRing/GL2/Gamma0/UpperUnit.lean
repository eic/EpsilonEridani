# The upper-left unit character of `Δ₀(N)`

An element of `Δ₀(N)` is an integral matrix, upper-triangular modulo `N`, whose upper-left
entry is a unit mod `N`. Reducing that entry gives a map

```
Δ₀(N) → (ZMod N)ˣ
```

which is multiplicative, because the lower-left entry vanishes mod `N` and so the cross term
in the product drops out. This is the `Δ₀(N)` counterpart of Mathlib's `Gamma0Map`, which
takes the *lower-right* entry of an element of `Γ₀(N)`; on `Γ₀(N)` the two are inverse to one
another, since `ad ≡ 1` there.

Composing with `χ : (ZMod N)ˣ →* ℂˣ` gives the twisting character of the `χ`-twisted Hecke
ring. It is **not** an extension of the nebentypus: `Delta0UpperUnit_mapGL` says that on
`Γ₀(N)` the composite `χ ∘ Delta0UpperUnit` restricts to the *inverse* of
`χ ∘ (Gamma0Map N).toHomUnits`, which is the character `modFormCharSpace` is defined by.

The inverse is the convention, not an accident. The twisted double-coset operator *divides*
by the character — each representative contributes `χ(·)⁻¹ • (f ∣[k] ·)` — so the value that
has to be attached to a monoid element is the reciprocal of the one attached to a group
element acting on forms. Reading `Delta0UpperUnit` as an extension of the nebentypus and
dropping the inverse would negate every twist downstream.

## Main definitions

* `HeckeRing.GL2.Delta0UpperUnit`: the monoid homomorphism `Δ₀(N) →* (ZMod N)ˣ`.

## Main results

* `HeckeRing.GL2.Delta0UpperUnit_apply_val`: *any* integral witness computes it. The
  definition has to choose a witness, but the witness is unique, so no consumer needs the
  chosen one.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.mapGL_mem_Delta0`: `Γ₀(N)` lands in `Δ₀(N)`, so the comparison below needs
  no membership hypothesis.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.Delta0UpperUnit_mapGL`: on `Γ₀(N)` it is inverse to `Gamma0Map`.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.adjugateGL_mapGL_mem_Delta0`: the adjugate of a `Γ₀(N)` matrix
  is again in `Δ₀(N)`, being the image of another `Γ₀(N)` element.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.Delta0UpperUnit_adjugateGL_mapGL`: on the adjugate the upper-left unit is
  `Gamma0Map` itself rather than its inverse — the second, non-inverted face of the
  character.

/-- **On `Γ₀(N)` the upper-left unit inverts `Gamma0Map`.** The determinant is one and the
lower-left entry vanishes mod `N`, so `ad ≡ 1`: the upper-left unit of `γ` viewed in `Δ₀(N)`
is the inverse of the lower-right unit Mathlib's `Gamma0Map` records.

So `Delta0UpperUnit` does **not** extend the nebentypus along `Gamma0Map`; it restricts to the
inverse of it. That is the convention the twisted Hecke ring wants, because the twisted
double-coset operator divides by the character rather than multiplying by it. -/

character. -/
