# Measure theory of the standard fundamental domain

The measure theory of the standard fundamental domain `𝒟 = ModularGroup.fd` for `SL₂(ℤ)`,
complementing its topology from `Mathlib/NumberTheory/Modular.lean`: `𝒟` has finite
invariant measure, its frontier is null, and therefore integrals over `𝒟` and its interior
`𝒟ᵒ` agree. The next section records that the translates `γ • 𝒟ᵒ` are open and that two are
disjoint unless their translating elements differ by a sign; these facts turn suitable finite
sums of integrals over translates into a single integral over their union.

Those two halves are exactly what `MeasureTheory.IsFundamentalDomain` asks for, and the last
section assembles them: `𝒟ᵒ` is a fundamental domain in the measure-theoretic sense. The group
acting has to be `PSL(2, ℤ)`, not `SL(2, ℤ)` — `−I` fixes every point of `ℍ`, so the translates
indexed by `SL(2, ℤ)` are never pairwise disjoint — and the domain has to be the open `𝒟ᵒ`, on
which Mathlib's Second Fundamental Domain Lemma is an honest disjointness rather than a
statement about a boundary. Covering is then only almost everywhere, the two domains differing
by the null frontier. Tiled over the cosets of a subgroup this gives a fundamental domain at
every level, which is what a Petersson product for a congruence subgroup is an integral over.

## Main results

* `ModularGroup.volume_fd_lt_top`: the standard fundamental domain has finite invariant
  measure.
* `ModularGroup.volume_frontier_fd`: the frontier of `𝒟` has zero invariant measure.
* `ModularGroup.fd_ae_eq_fdo`: `𝒟` and `𝒟ᵒ` agree almost everywhere (so set integrals
  over them coincide, via `MeasureTheory.setIntegral_congr_set`).
* `ModularGroup.isOpen_smul_fdo` and `ModularGroup.disjoint_smul_fdo`: the translates of the
  open fundamental domain are open, and two of them are disjoint unless the translating
  elements differ by a sign.
* `ModularGroup.isFundamentalDomain_fdo`: `𝒟ᵒ` is a fundamental domain for `PSL(2, ℤ)` acting
  on `ℍ` with the invariant measure.
* `ModularGroup.isFundamentalDomain_iUnion_out_inv_smul_fdo`: the coset tiling of `𝒟ᵒ` is a
  fundamental domain for any subgroup of `PSL(2, ℤ)`.
* `ModularGroup.isFundamentalDomain_iUnion_out_inv_smul_fdo_withCenter`: the same tiling indexed
  by `SL(2, ℤ) ⧸ Γ.withCenter`, which is the indexing the Petersson product uses.
* `ModularGroup.isFundamentalDomain_smul_of_inv_conjAct_eq`: an element of `GL(2, ℝ)`
  conjugating the image of `Γ` onto that of `Γ'` carries a fundamental domain for `Γ` to one for
  `Γ'` — the step that lets a Petersson product be compared with its translate under the Fricke
  or an Atkin–Lehner matrix, or under the matrix of a double coset operator.

Split out of the Petersson inner-product development ported from the AINTLIB
`LeanModularForms` project
(<https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB/tree/main/projects/LeanModularForms>,
`Modularforms/PeterssonInnerProduct.lean`, Chris Birkbeck).

Two of the results correspond to statements in that project:
`ModularGroup.isFundamentalDomain_fdo` to `isFundamentalDomain_fdo_PSL`
(`Modularforms/PSL2Action.lean`), and `ModularGroup.isFundamentalDomain_iUnion_out_inv_smul_fdo`
to `isFundamentalDomain_Gamma1_PSL` (`Modularforms/PeterssonLevelN.lean`), of which it is the
arbitrary-subgroup form — that one states the tiling for the image of `Γ₁(N)`. Both are stated
here for Mathlib's `volume : Measure ℍ` rather than that project's own hyperbolic measure. The
results on translates of `𝒟ᵒ` have no counterpart there.
