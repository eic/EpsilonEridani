# The quaternary case of the Hasse–Minkowski theorem

Let `Q` be a regular quadratic form of dimension four over a number field `K`. This file transfers
local isotropy of `Q` to the subforms of dimension three, and deduces the Hasse–Minkowski theorem
for `Q` from the Hasse–Minkowski theorem for ternary forms.

If the discriminant of `Q` is a square, then at every place the localization of `Q` has square
discriminant, so a form of dimension at least three represented by that localization is isotropic
as soon as `Q` is (O'Meara 42:12). Hence a form of dimension at least three locally represented by
`Q`, for instance the restriction of `Q` to a ternary subspace, is locally isotropic exactly when
`Q` is. If moreover `Q` is locally isotropic, the ternary theorem makes such a subform, and hence
`Q`, isotropic over `K`.

If the discriminant of `Q` is the class of `d`, then over any extension `L` of `K` containing a
square root of `d` the scalar extension of `Q` has square discriminant, and it is locally isotropic
when `Q` is, place by place through the completion tower. So every form of dimension at least three
locally represented by `Q ⊗ L` is locally isotropic. For `L = K(√d)` with `d` a nonsquare, the
square-discriminant case makes `Q ⊗ L` isotropic, and quaternary descent
(`QuadraticForm.anisotropic_baseChange_iff_quaternary`) brings isotropy of `Q ⊗ L` back to `Q`.

The ternary theorem enters as a hypothesis, stated for diagonal forms.

## Main results

* `QuadraticForm.LocallyRepresents.isLocallyIsotropic_iff_quaternary`: for `Q` regular quaternary
  of square discriminant, a form of dimension at least three locally represented by `Q` is locally
  isotropic exactly when `Q` is.
* `QuadraticForm.LocallyRepresents.isLocallyIsotropic_of_baseChange_quaternary`: for `Q` regular
  quaternary and locally isotropic, with discriminant the class of `d`, every form of dimension at
  least three locally represented by the scalar extension of `Q` to a number field containing a
  square root of `d` is locally isotropic.
* `QuadraticForm.not_anisotropic_of_isLocallyIsotropic_quaternary_of_discr_eq_zero`: a locally
  isotropic regular quaternary form of square discriminant is isotropic, given the ternary theorem
  over `K`.
* `QuadraticForm.not_anisotropic_of_isLocallyIsotropic_quaternary`: a locally isotropic regular
  quaternary form is isotropic, given the ternary theorem over every number field.

field, every regular diagonal ternary form that is isotropic at every finite and real place is

The ternary hypothesis is quantified over number fields because it is needed not only over `K` but
also over the quadratic field `K(√d)`, for `d` a nonsquare representative of the discriminant of
