# The candidate genus field is unramified over `ℚ(√d)` at the finite places

For a squarefree integer `d`, `candidateGenusField hd` is the compositum of the quadratic fields
attached to the prime discriminants dividing `fundamentalDiscriminant d`, and
`candidateGenusFieldBase hd` is the copy of `K = ℚ(√d)` inside it. This file proves that, for such
a `d` that is moreover not a rational square, every prime of `𝓞 K` is unramified in the candidate
genus field: it is an unramified extension of `ℚ(√d)` at all finite places. This is the defining
property of the genus field at the finite places, and the half of the genus-field identification
the roadmap flags as the trap, since it is exactly where ramification at `2` and at the primes
dividing `d` has to be controlled.

The work is done by the general criterion
`EpsilonEridani.Multiquadratic.isUnramifiedIn_of_forall_ramificationIdx_eq_two`: a subfield of a
prime-discriminant compositum in which every prime belonging to a factor already has ramification
index `2` carries all the ramification, so the compositum is unramified over it. Here that
subfield is the quadratic base, and the hypothesis is the total ramification of `ℚ(√d)` at the
primes dividing its discriminant, which are exactly the primes of the prime-discriminant factors.

An imaginary `d` is in particular not a rational square (`not_isSquare_of_neg`), and the base is
then totally complex, hence unramified at the infinite places too
(`isUnramifiedAtInfinitePlaces_candidateGenusField`), so for `d < 0` the two results together give
unramifiedness at *every* place: the candidate genus field of an imaginary quadratic field is an
everywhere-unramified abelian extension of it, so it lies inside the Hilbert class field. What
remains for the genus-field identification is maximality — that it is the largest such extension
abelian over `ℚ` — and the isomorphism `Gal(K_gen/K) ≅ Cl(K)/Cl(K)²`.

The description of the genus field as the prime-discriminant compositum is classical; see
D. A. Cox, *Primes of the Form x² + ny²*, and F. Lemmermeyer, *Reciprocity Laws*.

## Main result

* `EpsilonEridani.Multiquadratic.isUnramifiedIn_candidateGenusField`: for squarefree `d` that is not a
  rational square, every prime of `𝓞 ℚ(√d)` is unramified in the candidate genus field.
