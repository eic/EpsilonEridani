# The `AdjoinRoot (X² + 5)` model of `ℚ(√-5)`

The concrete number field `AdjoinRoot (X² + 5)` serving as the canonical model of `ℚ(√-5)`, together
with its integral generator. This presentation datum is foundational: it is shared by both the
class-number and the `2`-rank worked examples for this field, so it lives here rather than in either
of them.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.exists_minpoly_eq_X_sq_add_five_and_adjoin_eq_top`: the model has an
  integral generator with minimal polynomial `X² + 5` generating the field over `ℚ`.

/-- `X² + 5` is irreducible over `ℚ`, so `AdjoinRoot (X² + 5)` is a field. The instance carries an
explicit, field-specific name because an anonymous `Fact (Irreducible …)` instance receives an
auto-generated name that ignores the radicand, so the analogous instances for different radicands
would collide under one name when the whole library is loaded for the axioms audit. -/
