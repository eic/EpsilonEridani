# The class number of `ℚ(√3)`

This file proves that the real quadratic field `ℚ(√3)` has class number `1`.

Since `3 ≡ 3 (mod 4)` the ring of integers is `ℤ[√3]` and the discriminant is `12`. The field is
totally real, so its Minkowski bound is `(2!/2²) · √12 = √3 < 2`: every ideal class has an
integral representative of norm `1`, that is, the unit ideal. Mathlib's
`NumberField.RingOfIntegers.isPrincipalIdealRing_of_abs_discr_lt` packages exactly this
comparison, and `12 < 16` is the required numerical inequality.

Total reality is what makes the bound small enough: at absolute discriminant `12`, the
hypothetical imaginary-signature Minkowski bound would carry the extra factor `4/π`, giving
`(4/π)·√12/2 ≈ 2.2`, which would not suffice.

The main theorem is stated for any number field with an integral generator of minimal polynomial
`X² - 3`; the final theorem applies it to the `AdjoinRoot (X² - 3)` model.

  `AdjoinRoot (X² - 3)` model is `12`.
