# Splitting fields over number fields are number fields

The splitting field `f.SplittingField` of a polynomial `f` over a number field `K` is a finite
extension of `K`, hence a number field. In particular the splitting field of a rational
polynomial is a number field, so its Galois group `f.Gal` is the Galois group of a number field
and the arithmetic of `𝓞 f.SplittingField` (primes, Frobenius elements) is available in it
directly.

## Main results

* `Polynomial.SplittingField.instNumberField`: the splitting field of a polynomial over a number
  field is a number field.
