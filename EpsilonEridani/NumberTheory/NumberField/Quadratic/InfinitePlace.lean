# The infinite places of a quadratic field `ℚ(√d)`

The signature of `ℚ(√d)` is read off the sign of `d`: for `d < 0` the field is totally complex
and for `0 ≤ d` it is totally real. Both are special cases of the generic square-root criteria
`NumberField.isTotallyComplex_of_sq_ratCast_of_neg` and
`NumberField.isTotallyReal_of_sq_ratCast_of_nonneg`, applied to the generator `θ` with `θ² = d`.
Total reality needs the generator hypothesis as well, since a real square root only forces the
embeddings fixed on `ℚ(θ)` to be real.

* `NumberField.isTotallyReal_of_minpoly_eq_X_sq_sub_C_of_nonneg`.
