# The class of a ramified prime is 2-torsion

For a degree-two number field `K`, the unique prime `𝔭` of `𝓞 K` above a ramified rational prime `p`
satisfies `𝔭² = p 𝓞 K`, the extension of the principal ideal `(p)`, so its class `[𝔭]` in
`Cl(𝓞 K)` squares to `1`: it is an explicit element of the 2-torsion `Cl(𝓞 K)[2]`, the object
measured by `card_elementaryTwoQuotient_eq_card_twoTorsion`. The generator `p` of that principal
ideal is a *positive* rational integer, hence totally positive, so the same computation bounds the
order of `[𝔭]⁺` in the narrow class group `Cl⁺(K)`.

Any ring automorphism of `𝓞 K` fixes `𝔭` (`map_eq_self_of_mem_ramifiedPrimes`); applied to quadratic
conjugation this says `𝔭` is an *ambiguous* ideal, so the ramified primes furnish *individual*
explicit ambiguous 2-torsion classes. Determining all of `Cl(𝓞 K)[2]` (the ambiguous-class-number /
2-rank theorem of genus theory, which for real fields carries a unit-index correction relating these
strongly ambiguous classes to the ambiguous ones) is left to later work.

A ramified prime also *exhausts* the class group when the Minkowski bound is small enough: if that
bound is below `3` and `2` is ramified, then every ideal class is trivial or the class of the prime
above `2`, so `Cl(𝓞 K)` has at most two elements.

See D. A. Cox, *Primes of the Form x² + ny²*, and F. Lemmermeyer, *Reciprocity Laws*, for the
classical genus theory this result underlies.

## Main results

* `NumberField.classGroupMk0_sq_eq_one_of_mem_ramifiedPrimes`: the class of a ramified prime
  is 2-torsion.
* `NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.mk0_sq_eq_one_of_mem_ramifiedPrimes`: so is its narrow class.
* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.class_eq_one_or_eq_classGroupMk0_primeAboveTwo_of_minkowskiBound_lt_three`:
  with Minkowski bound below `3` and `2` ramified, every ideal class is trivial or the class of a
  prime above `2`.
