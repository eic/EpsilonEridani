# The intrinsic label prefix of a number field

Three invariants form the intrinsic prefix of a number field's LMFDB label: its degree `d`, its
number of real places `r`, and the absolute value `D` of its discriminant. They group the fields
of the tables rather than single one out — distinct fields can share a prefix. This file packages
them as a predicate `HasLMFDBIntrinsicLabel K d r D`.

The prefix carries more information than it appears to: it determines the **signed**
discriminant, not merely its absolute value. The sign is recovered from `d` and `r` alone,
because `(d - r) / 2` is the number of complex places and `NumberField.sign_discr` reads the
sign off that count.

Only the prefix is intrinsic. The index that separates distinct fields sharing a prefix is not
determined by these invariants — it depends on an external ordering of a certified complete
list — and nothing here defines or approximates it.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.HasLMFDBIntrinsicLabel`: the degree, real-place count and absolute
  discriminant of `K` are `d`, `r` and `D`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.hasLMFDBIntrinsicLabel_iff`: the defining conjunction, in `simp` normal
  form — the stable rewriting interface for the predicate.
* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.exists_hasLMFDBIntrinsicLabel`: every number field has such a triple, so
  the predicate is not vacuous.
* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.HasLMFDBIntrinsicLabel.unique`: and the triple is the only one.
* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.HasLMFDBIntrinsicLabel.sub_div_two_eq_nrComplexPlaces`: `(d - r) / 2`
  counts the complex places, read off a full label. The general statement about `K` alone is
  `NumberField.InfinitePlace.finrank_sub_nrRealPlaces_div_two_eq_nrComplexPlaces`, in
  `EpsilonEridani/NumberTheory/NumberField/InfinitePlace/Basic.lean`.
* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.HasLMFDBIntrinsicLabel.discr_eq`: **sign recovery**,
  `discr K = (-1) ^ ((d - r) / 2) * D`.

## References

* The sign of the discriminant is Mathlib's `NumberField.sign_discr`; this file combines it with
  the label data and does not reprove it.
