# Units bounded at every infinite place

Only finitely many units of the ring of integers of a number field have absolute value at most
`B` at every infinite place: such a unit is an algebraic integer all of whose conjugates are
bounded by `B`, and there are finitely many of those
(`NumberField.Embeddings.finite_of_norm_le`). This finiteness is what makes the certification
of a fundamental unit a finite search.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.Units.finite_setOf_forall_apply_le`: the set of units with absolute value at
  most `B` at every infinite place is finite.
* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.Units.finite_setOf_norm_logEmbedding_le`: the set of units in a bounded
  region of logarithmic space is finite.
