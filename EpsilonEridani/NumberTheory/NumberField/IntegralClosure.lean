# The integral closure of `𝓞 K` in a finite extension of number fields

For a finite extension `L` of a number field `K`, the integral closure of `𝓞 K` in `L` is the
integral closure of `ℤ` in `L` — that is `EpsilonEridani.IsIntegralClosure.tower_bot` applied along
`ℤ → 𝓞 K → L` — hence isomorphic to `𝓞 L`. Two consequences transfer along that identification
and are the finiteness inputs of the Mordell–Weil descent: the class group of the integral closure
is finite, and its unit group is finitely generated.

Both are stated for `integralClosure (𝓞 K) L` rather than for `𝓞 L`, because that is the ring the
descent actually produces — `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.ringOfIntegersFactor` is an integral closure
in a quotient `K[X] ⧸ (p)`, not a ring of integers presented as such.

## Main results

* `NumberField.finite_classGroup_integralClosure` : the **class number theorem** for it.
* `NumberField.fg_units_integralClosure` : the finite-generation half of **Dirichlet's unit
  theorem** for it.

  `NumberField.finite_classGroup_integralClosure` and `NumberField.fg_units_integralClosure` are
  adapted from it essentially verbatim. The `ℤ → 𝓞 K → L` identification they rest on is
