# Finite ideles and ideals away from a finite set

The finite-idele valuation `adicOrd` records the multiplicity of every finite place in the
fractional ideal attached to a finite idele.  This file makes that dictionary available at the
prime-to carriers used by ray classes: vanishing of the orders on a finite set is exactly
membership in `NumberFieldArithmetic.idealsAway`, and every nonzero integral ideal prime to that
set is realized by a finite idele with the corresponding orders.

The latter realization is the finite-idele form of the integral prime-to monoid.  It lets later
adelic constructions move between local valuations and the single ideal carrier used by the ray
class API, without introducing a second notion of an ideal prime to a modulus.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GlobalNumberFields.toFractionalIdeal_mem_idealsAway_iff` identifies the
  prime-to condition with vanishing finite-idele orders.
* `EpsilonEridani.GlobalNumberFields.toIdealsAway_surjective` realizes every fractional ideal away from
  a finite set by a finite idele whose orders vanish on that set.
* `EpsilonEridani.GlobalNumberFields.exists_forall_adicOrd_eq_count_integralIdealsAway` gives the
  resulting order/count comparison at every finite place.
* `EpsilonEridani.GlobalNumberFields.toIdealsAway` is the resulting homomorphism on the
  finite-idèle subgroup, with `mem_ker_toIdealsAway_iff` identifying its kernel.

The construction uses the standard idelic description of ideals away from a finite set.  The ideal
carriers and their factorization API are supplied by `EpsilonEridani.NumberFieldArithmetic`, while the
finite-idele factorization is supplied by `IsDedekindDomain.FiniteAdeleRing.ClassGroup`.
