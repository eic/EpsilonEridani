# Ramified support in towers of number fields

Ramification cannot disappear after extending the top field of a tower: if a prime of `𝓞 K`
ramifies in `L`, then it also ramifies in every finite extension `M` of `L`. Equivalently, the
ramified support of `L / K` is contained in that of `M / K`.

The result follows from the tower formula for relative discriminants. The relative discriminant
of `L / K` occurs to the positive power `[M : L]` as a factor of the relative discriminant of
`M / K`, so each of its prime divisors remains a prime divisor upstairs.

## Main result

* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.ramifiedSupport_mono`: the ramified support is monotone in the top field
  of a tower.

* J. Neukirch, *Algebraic Number Theory*, Chapter III, §2.
