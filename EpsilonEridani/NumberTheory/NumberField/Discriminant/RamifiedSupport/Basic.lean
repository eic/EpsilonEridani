# The ramified support of an extension of number fields

The primes of `𝓞 K` that ramify in `L` are exactly those dividing the relative discriminant
`relDiscr (𝓞 K) (𝓞 L)`, and there are finitely many of them. This file collects them into a
`Finset` of height-one primes, the **ramified support** of `L / K`.

Finiteness is not an extra hypothesis: the relative discriminant of a separable extension is
nonzero (`EpsilonEridani.relDiscr_ne_bot`), and a nonzero ideal of a Dedekind domain has
finitely many prime divisors (`Ideal.finite_factors`). For number fields the separability is
automatic.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.ramifiedSupport`: the primes of `𝓞 K` dividing `relDiscr (𝓞 K) (𝓞 L)`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.mem_ramifiedSupport`: membership is divisibility of the relative
  discriminant.
* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.mem_ramifiedSupport_iff_exists`: equivalently, some prime of `𝓞 L` above
  `v` has ramification index greater than one — so the name is honest.
* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.ramifiedSupport_self`: nothing ramifies in the identity extension, so the
  support of `K / K` is empty.
* `EpsilonEridani.NumberField.isUnramifiedAway_ramifiedSupport`: primes outside the ramified support are
  unramified throughout the extension.
