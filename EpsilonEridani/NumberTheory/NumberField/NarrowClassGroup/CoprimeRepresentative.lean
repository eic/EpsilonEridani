# Coprime representatives of narrow ideal classes

Every narrow ideal class of a number field has an integral representative coprime to any prescribed
nonzero ideal. This is the finite-place approximation input needed to evaluate genus characters on
narrow ideal classes in Layer 3 of the multiquadratic roadmap.

The proof starts with the Dedekind-domain approximation
`IsDedekindDomain.exists_sup_span_eq`, applied to `I * M ≤ I`. It gives an element `a ∈ I` such
that `I * M + (a) = I`; consequently the quotient `(a) / I` is coprime to `M`. Moving `a` inside
`I * M` by `NumberField.exists_isTotallyPositive_sub_mem` makes it nonzero and totally positive
without changing this ideal identity. Thus `(a) / I` represents the inverse narrow class of `I`.

This is the usual finite-prime form of strong approximation for ideal classes. See J. W. S. Cassels
and A. Fröhlich, *Algebraic Number Theory*, Chapter II.

## Main results

* `NumberField.exists_isTotallyPositive_span_eq_mul_isCoprime`: a totally positive principal
  multiple of a nonzero ideal whose quotient is coprime to a prescribed ideal.
* `NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.exists_mk0_eq_and_isCoprime`: every narrow ideal class has a
  nonzero integral representative coprime to a prescribed nonzero ideal.
* `NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.exists_mk0_eq_and_isCoprime_absNorm`: the representative may be
  chosen with absolute norm coprime to a prescribed nonzero integer.

there are a nonzero totally positive algebraic integer `a` and a nonzero ideal `J`, coprime to `M`,

Equivalently, `J = (a) / I`. The element `a` may be chosen totally positive while retaining the
finite-place coprimality because `NumberField.exists_isTotallyPositive_sub_mem` moves it inside
`I * M`, which does not change the ideal it generates together with `I * M`. -/
