# The residue degree in a cyclotomic extension

The classical cyclotomic splitting law: at a prime `𝔭` not dividing `m`, the residue degree of a
prime of `F` above `𝔭` is the multiplicative order of `𝔑𝔭` modulo `m`. Over `ℚ` this is the
familiar statement that `f(p)` is the order of `p` in `(ZMod m)ˣ` — so `p` splits completely
exactly when `p ≡ 1 (mod m)`, and is inert exactly when `p` generates `(ZMod m)ˣ`.

The law is stated twice: once with the residue degree as the order of the cyclotomic character
at a Frobenius element, and once with it as the order of a unit of `ZMod m` reducing to `𝔑𝔭`.
The second form is the computational one — it turns a question about prime splitting into a
multiplicative order in `(ZMod m)ˣ` — and takes that unit from the caller, together with the
proof that it reduces to `𝔑𝔭`, so that a caller may pass whichever presentation it holds. Over
`ℚ` that is typically `ZMod.unitOfCoprime p`.

## Main results

* `IsPrimitiveRoot.inertiaDeg_eq_orderOf_autToPow`: the residue degree is the order of the
  cyclotomic character at a Frobenius element at `Q`.
* `IsPrimitiveRoot.inertiaDeg_eq_orderOf_of_val_eq_absNorm`: equivalently, the order of `𝔑𝔭`
  in `(ZMod m)ˣ`.
