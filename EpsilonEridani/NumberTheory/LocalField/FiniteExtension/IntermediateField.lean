# Local-field structures on finite intermediate fields

A finite intermediate field of an extension of a nonarchimedean local field need not inherit a
topology or a valuative relation from its ambient field. This file packages the spectral-norm
construction for such an intermediate field directly. The resulting named normed-field,
valuative-relation, and topology structures can be installed locally without placing any
structure on the ambient field and without introducing global instance diamonds.

The three accompanying theorems give the closed construction chain needed by consumers: the
new valuative relation extends the one on the base, the new topology is valuative, and together
they make the intermediate field a nonarchimedean local field.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.finiteIntermediateFieldNormedField`: the spectral-norm structure on a finite
  intermediate field.
* `EpsilonEridani.finiteIntermediateFieldValuativeRel`: its valuative relation.
* `EpsilonEridani.finiteIntermediateFieldTopology`: its topology.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.finiteIntermediateField_valuativeExtension`: the valuation extends the base
  valuation.
* `EpsilonEridani.finiteIntermediateField_isValuativeTopology`: the topology is induced by the
  valuation.
* `EpsilonEridani.finiteIntermediateField_isNonarchimedeanLocalField`: the intermediate field is a
  nonarchimedean local field.
