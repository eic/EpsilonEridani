# Unramified extensions of local fields

Let `L/K` be an extension of nonarchimedean local fields whose valuations are compatible, in the
sense of `ValuativeExtension K L`. This file defines the predicate

`EpsilonEridani.IsUnramified K L`

by the two conditions that the value group of `K` is carried onto that of `L`, in the form
`ramificationIndex K L = 1`, and that the residue extension `𝓀[L] / 𝓀[K]` is separable. The
second condition is automatic here, because the residue field of a nonarchimedean local field is
finite and hence perfect, but it is the condition that makes the predicate the arithmetic notion
of unramifiedness for a general valued field, and it is what the comparison with the étale
notions rests on.

The file proves the equivalent forms of the predicate that later work uses: the value-group form,
the valuation form `v_L ∘ algebraMap = v_K`, the ideal form `𝓂[K] 𝒪[L] = 𝓂[L]`, the degree form
`f(L/K) = [L : K]`, and the comparison with `Algebra.FormallyUnramified 𝒪[K] 𝒪[L]` and
`Algebra.IsUnramifiedAt 𝒪[K] 𝓂[L]`, which makes Mathlib's unramifiedness theory available for
extensions of local fields. Unramifiedness is also shown to be stable in a tower in both
directions.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsUnramified`: an extension of nonarchimedean local fields is unramified when its
  ramification index is `1` and its residue extension is separable.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isUnramified_iff_ramificationIndex_eq_one`: the separability condition is automatic,
  so the predicate is `e(L/K) = 1`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isUnramified_iff_normalizedValuation_comp_unitsMap_surjective`: `L/K` is unramified
  exactly when the normalized value group of `K` is carried onto that of `L`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isUnramified_iff_normalizedValuation_algebraMap`: `L/K` is unramified exactly when the
  normalized valuation of `L` restricts to that of `K`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isUnramified_iff_map_maximalIdeal_eq`: `L/K` is unramified exactly when `𝓂[K]`
  generates `𝓂[L]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsUnramified.irreducible_algebraMap`: in an unramified extension a uniformizer of `K`
  stays a uniformizer of `L`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isUnramified_iff_inertiaDegree_eq_finrank`: `L/K` is unramified exactly when
  `f(L/K) = [L : K]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsUnramified.isTamelyRamified`: an unramified extension is tamely ramified.
* `EpsilonEridani.isUnramified_tower_iff`, `EpsilonEridani.IsUnramified.trans`,
  `EpsilonEridani.IsUnramified.tower_bot` and `EpsilonEridani.IsUnramified.tower_top`: `M/K` is unramified
  exactly when both steps of a tower `M/L/K` are.
* `EpsilonEridani.isUnramified_iff_formallyUnramified` and `EpsilonEridani.isUnramified_iff_isUnramifiedAt`:
  the comparison with Mathlib's `Algebra.FormallyUnramified` and `Algebra.IsUnramifiedAt` for
  `𝒪[L]` over `𝒪[K]`.

/-- An extension `L/K` of nonarchimedean local fields with compatible valuations is
**unramified** when the normalized value group of `K` is carried onto that of `L`, that is
`e(L/K) = 1`, and the residue extension `𝓀[L] / 𝓀[K]` is separable.

The separability condition is automatic for nonarchimedean local fields, whose residue fields
are finite and hence perfect; it is carried in the definition because it is what the notion means
for a general valued field, and it is one of the two halves of Mathlib's criterion
`Algebra.FormallyUnramified.iff_map_maximalIdeal_eq`. -/
