# Lower ramification groups of a local field extension

For a finite Galois extension `L/K` of nonarchimedean local fields, the canonical lower
ramification group consists of automorphisms acting trivially on the integer ring modulo
the `(i + 1)`-st power of its maximal ideal. The integer index is total: at `i ≤ -1` the
group is the full Galois group.

This is the local field specialization of `EpsilonEridani.IsLocalRing.ramificationGroup`. Besides the
integer-indexed filtration, the file provides the real indexing `G_u = G_{⌈u⌉}` on which the
Herbrand function is built, the largest jump of the filtration, and its compatibility with the
subgroup `Gal(L/K') ≤ Gal(L/K)` of a tower `L/K'/K`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.LocalFieldsRamification.lowerRamificationGroup K L i`: the `i`-th lower-numbering
  ramification group of `L/K`.
* `EpsilonEridani.LocalFieldsRamification.lowerRamificationGroupReal K L u`: the same filtration indexed
  by `u : ℝ` through the ceiling.
* `EpsilonEridani.LocalFieldsRamification.largestLowerJump K L`: for a nontrivial Galois group, the
  largest index `t` with `G_t ≠ 1`; it is `-1` by convention when the Galois group is trivial.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.LocalFieldsRamification.mem_lowerRamificationGroup_iff`: the defining congruence
  `σ • x ≡ x mod 𝔪 ^ (i + 1)` on `𝒪[L]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.LocalFieldsRamification.lowerRamificationGroup_eq_top_of_le_neg_one`,
  `EpsilonEridani.LocalFieldsRamification.lowerRamificationGroup_zero` and
  `EpsilonEridani.LocalFieldsRamification.lowerRamificationGroup_antitone`: the filtration is `⊤` below
  `0`, starts with the inertia group of the maximal ideal, and decreases.
* `EpsilonEridani.LocalFieldsRamification.lowerRamificationGroup_natCast`: at a nonnegative index it is
  `Ideal.ramificationGroup` of the maximal ideal of `𝒪[L]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.LocalFieldsRamification.lowerRamificationGroup_zero_eq_map_inertiaSubgroup`: `G_0` is
  Mathlib's `ValuationSubring.inertiaSubgroup` of the valuation subring of `L`.
* `EpsilonEridani.LocalFieldsRamification.instNormalLowerRamificationGroup`: each `G_i` is normal.
* `EpsilonEridani.LocalFieldsRamification.exists_forall_lowerRamificationGroup_eq_bot` and
  `EpsilonEridani.LocalFieldsRamification.lowerRamificationGroup_eq_bot_iff`: `G_i = 1` for large `i`,
  precisely for `i` past the largest jump when the Galois group is nontrivial.
* `EpsilonEridani.LocalFieldsRamification.lowerRamificationGroupReal_eq_of_sub_one_lt_of_le`: the real
  indexing is constant on each interval `(i - 1, i]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.LocalFieldsRamification.lowerRamificationGroupReal_eq_bot_iff`: for a nontrivial
  Galois group, `G_u = 1` exactly for real `u` past the largest jump.
* `EpsilonEridani.LocalFieldsRamification.map_restrictScalarsHom_lowerRamificationGroup`: for a tower
  `L/K'/K`, the filtration of `H = Gal(L/K')` is `H ∩ G_i`.
