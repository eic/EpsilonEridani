# Local connectedness of continuous images of compact spaces

Local connectedness is not preserved by continuous images in general — every metric space is a
continuous image of a discrete one — but it *is* preserved by quotient maps, and hence by the
continuous images that are automatically quotient maps: those of a compact space in a Hausdorff
one. This file proves that, in the type-level form and in the set-level form
`EpsilonEridani.locallyConnectedSpace_image_of_isCompact` that a subset of a topological space needs.

The quotient step itself is Mathlib's. `Topology.IsCoinducing.locallyConnectedSpace` states that
a topology coinduced by a locally connected one is locally connected, which reaches quotient maps
through `IsQuotientMap.isCoinducing` and is strictly more general, since coinducing does not ask
for surjectivity. What is added here is the passage from that to a continuous surjection out of a
compact space, which is closed and therefore a quotient map.

The intended consumer is layer **L5** of the conformal-mapping roadmap, Carathéodory's boundary
correspondence: a conformal map that extends continuously to the closure of its domain carries a
locally connected boundary to a locally connected boundary, which is the necessary half of
Carathéodory's continuity theorem. That application is in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/LocallyConnectedBoundary.lean`; nothing here is specific to it.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.locallyConnectedSpace_of_continuous_surjective` — the continuous image of a compact
  locally connected space in a Hausdorff space is locally connected.
* `EpsilonEridani.locallyConnectedSpace_image_of_isCompact` — the set-level form: `f '' s` is locally
  connected for a compact, locally connected `s` on which `f` is continuous.

a quotient map, hence coinducing, so `Topology.IsCoinducing.locallyConnectedSpace` applies. -/
