# Images of real half-intervals under monotone maps

The image of a half-infinite real interval under a continuous strictly monotone map is determined
by its value at the finite endpoint and its limit at infinity.  The endpoint at infinity is omitted
when the limit is finite.

## Main result

* `ContinuousOn.image_Ici_of_strictMonoOn_of_tendsto` — a continuous strictly
  increasing map
  on `Ici p` with a finite limit at `+∞` maps that interval to the half-open interval between its
  endpoint value and its limit.
