# Filling in the bounded complementary components of a set

The **filled hull** `EpsilonEridani.filledHull K` of a subset `K` of a topological space with a bornology
is `K` together with the bounded connected components of its complement: the points whose component
in `Kᶜ` is bounded. Points of `K` qualify vacuously, their component in `Kᶜ` being empty. Filling a
circle gives the closed disc it bounds; filling a segment, or any set whose complement is connected
and unbounded, changes nothing.

This file is the topological layer: the definition and the structural facts, which ask only for a
topology and a bornology, being about components and boundedness and nothing else. That filling
does not make a set wider needs a real normed space and lives in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Normed/Module/FilledHull.lean`.

The shape in which the structural side is spent is `IsPreconnected.subset_filledHull`: a
preconnected set disjoint from `K` is trapped inside the filled hull as soon as it meets it, since
it then lies in a single bounded component. Together with the width bound of the normed file it
says that *a connected set that a small `K` cuts off from infinity is itself small*, with no
regularity asked of `K`; that composite is `IsPreconnected.diam_le_diam_of_disjoint` there.

The negation of membership — that the component of a point in the complement of `K` is *unbounded*
— already occurs, unfolded, in the winding-number layer: it is the hypothesis of
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_eq_zero_of_unbounded_component` in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Contour/Winding/UnboundedComponent.lean` and of its cycle form
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.Cycle.windingNumber_eq_zero_of_unbounded_component` in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Contour/Cycle/Winding.lean`, both of which say that the winding number vanishes
off the filled hull of the trace. Those statements are left as they stand: they are about the
unbounded side, which needs no name, whereas everything here is about the filled side.

The hull is deliberately *not* claimed to be closed, connected, or idempotent — none of which is
needed downstream, and the first two of which fail without hypotheses on `K`.

## Roadmap role

Plane separation for Jordan curves was the open frontier item of layer **L5** of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`, the Carathéodory boundary correspondence. The
enclosure step now runs through `IsPreconnected (K \ {f z₀})` and the winding-number two-sidedness
theorem
(`EpsilonEridani.image_inter_ball_subset_filledHull_of_diam_lt_of_isPreconnected_sdiff_singleton`),
which `IsJordanCurve.isPathConnected_sdiff_singleton` discharges; `Caratheodory.lean` is
unconditional.
The inside of `J` is `filledHull J \ J` in the vocabulary defined here. Nothing here assumes
separation, or any other regularity of `K`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.filledHull` — the filled hull, and `EpsilonEridani.subset_filledHull`,
  `EpsilonEridani.filledHull_mono` its two structural properties.
* `EpsilonEridani.filledHull_eq_self` — filling a set whose complement is preconnected and unbounded
  changes nothing.
* `IsPreconnected.subset_filledHull` — a preconnected set disjoint from `K` that meets the
  filled hull lies in it.
* `EpsilonEridani.subset_filledHull_of_frontier_subset` — a bounded set whose frontier `K` swallows
  lies in the filled hull, with no connectivity asked of it.

/-- The **filled hull** of a set `K`: the points whose connected component in the complement of `K`
is bounded. Equivalently, `K` together with the bounded connected components of `Kᶜ`; a point of
`K` belongs because its component in `Kᶜ` is empty. -/

empty set is bounded. -/

it, hence can only turn unbounded components into bounded ones. -/

/-- **Filling changes nothing when the complement is connected and unbounded.** The complement is
then a single component and that component is unbounded, so no point outside `K` is filled in. This
is the case of a segment in the plane, and of any set that does not separate the space. -/

/-- **A preconnected set that a set cuts off from infinity lies in its filled hull.** If `S` is
preconnected and disjoint from `K`, then `S` lies in a single connected component of `Kᶜ`; meeting
the filled hull says that component is bounded, so all of `S` is in the hull. -/

/-- **A bounded set whose frontier lies in `K` is cut off from infinity by `K`.** A point of
`S \ K` lies in `interior S`, since every non-interior point of `S` lies on `frontier S ⊆ K`. Its
connected component in `Kᶜ` cannot leave `interior S`: were it to, it would meet
`frontier (interior S) ⊆ frontier S ⊆ K` by `IsPreconnected.inter_frontier_nonempty`,
while lying in `Kᶜ`. So that component is bounded because `S` is. Points of `S ∩ K` lie in the
filled hull directly.

Unlike `IsPreconnected.subset_filledHull` this asks nothing of the connectivity of `S` and
nothing about the hull being met, at the price of asking `K` to swallow the whole frontier — the
same trade as between `EpsilonEridani.diam_le_diam_of_frontier_subset` and
`IsPreconnected.diam_le_diam_of_disjoint`. -/
