# Evaluating the homeomorphism between equal sets

This file records how Mathlib's `Homeomorph.setCongr`, the homeomorphism between the subtypes of
two equal sets, acts on points in both directions.

## Main results

* `Homeomorph.setCongr_apply`: `setCongr` retypes a point without moving it.
* `EpsilonEridani.Homeomorph.setCongr_symm_apply`: its inverse also retypes a point without moving it.
