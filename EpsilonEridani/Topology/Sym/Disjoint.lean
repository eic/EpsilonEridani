# Disjoint open embeddings into a symmetric power

Given open embeddings with pairwise disjoint ranges, ordered tuples mapped pointwise through those
embeddings embed openly as unordered tuples. In particular, given pairwise disjoint open
neighbourhoods `U i` of `n` distinct points, their product is an open subspace of `Sym α n`;
obtaining such neighbourhoods in a Hausdorff space is a separate step. The proof comes from
`EpsilonEridani.Sym.ofFn` being continuous and open together with `IsOpenEmbedding.piMap`.

Splitting over the distinct points of a tuple, with the multiplicities as the degrees, is how the
symmetric power of a surface is charted: a neighbourhood of a tuple with
distinct points `z₁, …, z_k` of multiplicities `n₁, …, n_k` is a product of the symmetric powers
`Sym^{n_j}` of disjoint coordinate discs, each of which is an open subspace of affine space by
`EpsilonEridani.Sym.isOpenEmbedding_coeffEquiv_comp_map`. Lane F4.1 of the analytic Heegaard Floer
roadmap needs exactly this to give `Sym^g(Σ)` its complex structure, after Ozsváth--Szabó
([arXiv:math/0101206](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0101206), §2.1). The coefficient homeomorphism
is in `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Polynomial/SymmetricPower.lean`, while the charts and charted structure are
in `EpsilonEridani/Geometry/Manifold/SymmetricPower.lean`. Family-level concatenation along disjoint open
sets, and the Hausdorff separation producing the family that a given tuple needs, are in
`EpsilonEridani/Topology/Sym/Family.lean`.

## Main declaration

* `EpsilonEridani.Sym.isOpenEmbedding_ofFn_map`: open embeddings with pairwise disjoint ranges induce an
  open embedding from their product into the symmetric power.

/-! ### Tuples mapped into pairwise disjoint open ranges -/

/-- **Away from the diagonal the symmetric power is a product.** Open embeddings with pairwise
disjoint ranges induce an open embedding from their product into the symmetric power. Applied to
subtype inclusions, this says conditionally that given pairwise disjoint open neighbourhoods `U i`
of `n` distinct points, their product is an open subspace of `Sym α n`; constructing such a family
in a Hausdorff space is a separate step. -/
