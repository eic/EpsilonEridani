# The symmetric power of a topological space

The `n`-th symmetric power `Sym α n` of a type is the type of unordered `n`-tuples of points of
`α`. It is the quotient of the space `Fin n → α` of ordered tuples by the permutation action, and
this file gives it the corresponding quotient topology, together with the API that a quotient
topology is used through: the quotient map is continuous, and a map out of `Sym α n` is continuous
exactly when its composition with the quotient map is.

The quotient map is `EpsilonEridani.Sym.ofFn` of `EpsilonEridani/Data/Sym/Basic.lean`, which reads an ordered
tuple as an unordered one; the `Fin n → α` form is the one that carries a product topology, so it
is what the quotient topology is defined against. Its surjectivity and the description
`EpsilonEridani.Sym.ofFn_eq_ofFn_iff` of its fibres as the orbits of the permutation action are the two
facts about it used below.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Sym.preimage_image_ofFn`: the saturation of a set of ordered tuples under `ofFn` is the
  union of its reindexings.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sym.instTopologicalSpace`: the quotient topology on `Sym α n`, coinduced along `ofFn`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sym.isQuotientMap_ofFn`, `EpsilonEridani.Sym.continuous_ofFn` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Sym.continuous_iff_comp_ofFn`: the resulting quotient-map API.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sym.isOpenMap_ofFn`, `EpsilonEridani.Sym.isClosedMap_ofFn` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Sym.isOpenQuotientMap_ofFn`: the quotient map is open and closed, the permutation group
  being finite.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sym.continuous_map`, `EpsilonEridani.Sym.isOpenMap_map` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Sym.isOpenEmbedding_map`: the `n`-th symmetric power of a continuous, open, or open
  embedding map is again one; in particular the symmetric power of an open subspace is an open
  subspace of the symmetric power.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sym.isOpen_setOf_forall_mem`: the tuples with all their points in an open set form an
  open set.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sym.continuous_append` and `EpsilonEridani.Sym.isOpenMap_append`: concatenation of symmetric
  powers is continuous and open.
* `EpsilonEridani.Sym.instCompactSpace` and `EpsilonEridani.Sym.instT2Space`: the symmetric power of a compact
  space is compact, and that of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff.

Lane F4.1 of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap needs `Sym^g(Σ)` as a space before it can be
given a complex structure; this file supplies the underlying topology, and
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Polynomial/SymmetricPower.lean` identifies it, over an algebraically closed
normed field, with affine space through the elementary symmetric functions.
