# Infima of a lower semicontinuous function over a compact factor

A lower semicontinuous function on a nonempty compact space attains its infimum, and the partial
infimum `y ↦ ⨅ x, f (x, y)` of a jointly lower semicontinuous function over a compact first factor
is again lower semicontinuous.

The first statement is recorded here as an equation rather than as `IsMinOn` because that is the
form the second needs: proving lower semicontinuity means turning a strict lower bound valid at
every point of the compact factor into a strict lower bound for the infimum itself, and attainment
is what performs that step. Only lower semicontinuity of `f` is used, so no continuity,
metrizability or countability hypothesis appears, and the order `β` carries no topology of its own.

Mathlib has `LowerSemicontinuousOn.exists_isMinOn`, the extreme value theorem for lower
semicontinuous functions, but nothing about infima over a compact factor of a product: its
semicontinuity operations combine functions on a fixed domain, and the corresponding
`lowerSemicontinuous_iInf` is false without compactness: arbitrary infima do not preserve lower
semicontinuity. What an infimum does preserve is upper semicontinuity, of upper semicontinuous
and in particular of continuous functions, which is `upperSemicontinuous_iInf`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_iInf_eq_of_lowerSemicontinuous`: on a nonempty compact space, a lower
  semicontinuous function attains its infimum.
* `EpsilonEridani.lowerSemicontinuous_iInf_of_compactSpace`: the partial infimum of a jointly lower
  semicontinuous function over a compact first factor is lower semicontinuous.
