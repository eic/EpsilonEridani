# Countable generation of neighbourhoods passes to the separated completion

If the neighbourhood filter of a point of a uniform space is countably generated, so is the
neighbourhood filter of its image in the separated completion. Nothing is assumed of the space
beyond its uniformity — no separation, no completeness, no algebraic structure.

`EpsilonEridani.Topology.Algebra.GroupCompletion` specialises this to the zero of a uniform
space with a zero, which is the form typeclass resolution consumes.
