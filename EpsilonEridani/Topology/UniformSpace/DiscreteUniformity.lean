# Discrete topological groups have the discrete uniformity

A complement to Mathlib's `DiscreteUniformity`: a right-uniform additive group whose topology is
discrete has the discrete uniformity, since its uniformity is the comap of the (discrete)
neighbourhood filter of zero.

## Main results

* `DiscreteUniformity.of_discreteTopology` : a right-uniform additive group with discrete topology
  has the discrete uniformity. Stated as a theorem, not an instance: together with Mathlib's
  `DiscreteUniformity → DiscreteTopology` instance it would form a resolution cycle. It lives
  in the root `DiscreteUniformity` namespace it extends, following this repository's
  convention for lemmas about external types.
