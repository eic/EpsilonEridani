# Truncating powers of distances by tails about a basepoint

In a pseudometric space a displacement larger than `2 R` forces one of its two endpoints to lie at
distance at least `R` from a basepoint `x`, and then the displacement is at most twice that
distance. Consequently the `q`-th power of a displacement is at most its truncation at `2 R` plus
`2 ^ q` times the parts, beyond distance `R` from `x`, of the `q`-th powers of the distances of the
two endpoints from `x`. This is the pointwise estimate through which the tails of the moments of
two laws control the transport cost of an unbounded power of the distance.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.coe_nndist_rpow` — the nonnegative and extended powers of a distance agree;
* `EpsilonEridani.continuous_nndist_rpow_const` — a nonnegative power of distance from a fixed point is
  continuous;
* `EpsilonEridani.edist_rpow_le_min_add_indicator` — the pointwise truncation estimate.
