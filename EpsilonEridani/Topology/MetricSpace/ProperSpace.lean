# Proper spaces and compact exhaustions with diverging distance

A pseudometric space is proper, that is, its closed balls are compact, exactly when it admits an
increasing sequence of compact sets `K n` covering it such that the distance from a fixed point
`p` tends to infinity along every sequence `q` with `q n ∉ K n`.

In a proper space the closed balls `closedBall p n` form such an exhaustion. Conversely, the
divergence condition alone makes every bounded set lie in some `K n`, so monotonicity and covering
are unnecessary for this direction. The base point `p` is arbitrary on both sides.

This is the equivalence of assertions (b) and (e) in do Carmo's statement of the Hopf–Rinow
theorem.  It holds in every pseudometric space; the Riemannian structure plays no role.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_subset_of_isBounded_of_tendsto_dist`: under the divergence condition, every
  bounded set lies in some `K n`.
* `EpsilonEridani.properSpace_of_isCompact_of_tendsto_dist`: compact `K n` with the divergence condition
  make the space proper.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_isCompact_monotone_iUnion_eq_univ_tendsto_dist`: a proper space has an
  exhaustion by compact sets with the divergence condition, namely by the closed balls about `p`.
* `EpsilonEridani.properSpace_iff_exists_isCompact_monotone_iUnion_eq_univ_tendsto_dist`: the
  equivalence.

compact sets covering the space along which the distance from `p` diverges: if `q n ∉ K n` for
every `n`, then `dist p (q n)` tends to infinity.

/-- **Properness via a compact exhaustion.** A pseudometric space is proper if and only if, for a
given point `p`, it is the union of an increasing sequence of compact sets `K n` such that the
distance from `p` tends to infinity along every sequence `q` with `q n ∉ K n`.
