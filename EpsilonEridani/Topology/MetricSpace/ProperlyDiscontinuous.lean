# Balls separated from their translates outside the stabilizer

For a properly discontinuous action on a locally compact metric space, every point `x` lies in a
ball which meets none of its translates by group elements outside the stabilizer of `x`: a group
element moving that ball to meet itself already fixes `x`.

This separation is one half of the localization of an orbit space near a point with nontrivial
stabilizer. The other half, that the ball is itself invariant under the stabilizer, does not
follow from the hypotheses here: under `ContinuousConstSMul` alone an element fixing `x` need not
preserve a ball about `x`. Once that invariance is supplied — for an isometric action, say, whose
elements fixing `x` preserve every ball about `x` — the orbit space of the whole group near `x`
agrees with the orbit space of the single stabilizer, which for a properly discontinuous action
is a finite group.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.eventually_smul_eq_self_of_image_smul_ball_inter_nonempty`: for every small enough
  ball about a point, a scalar moving a point of the ball into the ball fixes the centre.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_ball_disjoint_smul_of_notMem_stabilizer`: a small enough ball about a point is
  disjoint from each of its translates by a group element not fixing that point.
