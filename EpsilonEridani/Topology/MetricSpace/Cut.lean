# Cutting a set by a sphere

Removing the sphere `sphere x ρ` from a set `s` leaves two pieces: the *near side*
`s ∩ ball x ρ`, of the points of `s` closer to `x` than `ρ`, and the *far side*
`s \ closedBall x ρ`, of those further away. This file records that they cover `s \ sphere x ρ`,
that they are disjoint, that the two sides together with the cut cover all of `s` (also after
applying an arbitrary map), and — when `s` is open, so that both sides are open — that a
preconnected subset of `s` missing the sphere lies entirely in one of them.

Nothing beyond the containments `ball x ρ ⊆ closedBall x ρ` and `sphere x ρ ⊆ closedBall x ρ`, and
the openness of a ball against the closedness of a closed ball, is used, so `s` is an arbitrary set
in an arbitrary pseudo-metric space.

The one quantitative statement is about *shrinking* the cut. When the cut point `x` lies off `s`,
the far side keeps two prescribed points of `s` once `ρ` is small enough, so the image of the far
side stays at least as wide as the distance between their two distinct images: the far side does
not degenerate as the cut shrinks. Distinctness of those two images is what forces a genuine metric,
rather than pseudo-metric, structure on both sides, and that statement alone is stated for one.

The intended consumer is layer **L5** of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`, Carathéodory's
boundary correspondence, through `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Crosscut/Basic.lean` and
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/CutDiameter.lean`: there `X = ℂ` and the sphere is the
*circular crosscut* of a plane domain at a boundary point, whose near side is the approach region
along which the boundary behaviour of a conformal map is read off. Nothing here is specific to that
use, and Mathlib has no form of the decomposition.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.sdiff_sphere_eq_inter_ball_union_sdiff_closedBall` — the two sides cover the cut set.
* `EpsilonEridani.disjoint_inter_ball_sdiff_closedBall` — the two sides are disjoint, and
  `EpsilonEridani.disjoint_inter_ball_inter_sphere`, `EpsilonEridani.disjoint_sdiff_closedBall_inter_sphere` —
  each of them is disjoint from the cut.
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_inter_ball_union_sdiff_closedBall_union_inter_sphere` — the two sides and the cut
  cover the whole set, and
  `EpsilonEridani.image_eq_image_inter_ball_union_image_sdiff_closedBall_union_image_inter_sphere` is its
  image under an arbitrary map.
* `EpsilonEridani.subset_inter_ball_or_subset_sdiff_closedBall` — a preconnected subset of an open cut set
  missing the sphere lies on one side of it.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_pos_forall_le_diam_image_sdiff_closedBall` — cutting at a point off the set, the
  image of the far side stays at least as wide as a fixed positive number for every small enough
  radius.
