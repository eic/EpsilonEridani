# The path traced by a function on an open interval

A curve is often produced not as a `Path` but as a function `g : ℝ → X` defined on an *open*
interval `Ioo a b`, continuous there, and converging at each of the two ends. This file turns such
a function into an honest `Path` between its two limits, `EpsilonEridani.Path.ofContinuousOnIoo`, and
records what its values are on the interior of the unit interval and what its range is.

The construction is the extension `EpsilonEridani.extendIoo a b u v g` of `g` across the two ends of the
interval by the prescribed values `u` and `v`, composed with the affine reparametrisation
`AffineMap.lineMap a b : [0, 1] → [a, b]`. Because those two values are *given* rather than
recovered as limits, the continuity of the extension on `Icc a b`
(`EpsilonEridani.continuousOn_Icc_extendIoo`) needs no separation assumption on `X`, unlike Mathlib's
`continuousOn_Icc_extendFrom_Ioo` for `extendFrom`, which must locate the limits and so asks for a
regular codomain, and `eq_lim_at_left_extendFrom_Ioo`, which asks for a Hausdorff one. Nothing else
is needed: the two endpoint limits are exactly the data that a `Path` between them requires.

The range is `closure (g '' Ioo a b)` rather than `g '' Ioo a b`: the path traverses the closed
interval, and the image of a compact set under a map continuous on it is the closure of the image
of the dense open part. So the closure of a curve given on an open interval is automatically
path-connected, with the curve itself as the interior of the traversal — which is what makes this
construction useful, since the endpoints are in general *not* values of `g`.

## Simplicity

Whether the path is simple is not a matter of the extension but of `g` and of the endpoints, and
the one step of that argument which is not a plain composition is recorded here, in the
reparametrisation-only form and with no topology on `X` at all:
`EpsilonEridani.eq_or_eq_endpoints_of_notMem_of_forall_mem_Ioo` says that if a curve on the unit interval
is injective on the interior, and that interior stays inside a set to which neither endpoint value
belongs, then the only repetition left is between the two endpoints. That is the statement "the
path is a simple arc, except that it may be a loop".

It is stated for a bare function `unitInterval → X`, with no hypothesis relating it to `g` or to
the extension, rather than for `EpsilonEridani.Path.ofContinuousOnIoo` itself: a consumer typically
receives its path from an existential and knows only a parametrisation formula for it, which it
uses to establish the membership and injectivity hypotheses; a `Path` specializes through its
coercion. Injectivity on the interior is likewise left to the call site, being the injectivity of
`g` composed with that of `AffineMap.lineMap a b`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.extendIoo` — a function on `Ioo a b`, extended across both ends by prescribed values,
  with `EpsilonEridani.extendIoo_apply_of_mem_Ioo`, `EpsilonEridani.extendIoo_apply_of_le_left` and
  `EpsilonEridani.extendIoo_apply_of_left_lt_of_right_le` computing it at every point, and
  `EpsilonEridani.continuousOn_Icc_extendIoo`, its continuity on `Icc a b`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Path.ofContinuousOnIoo` — the path traced by a function continuous on `Ioo a b` with a
  limit at each end, from the limit at `a` to the limit at `b`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Path.ofContinuousOnIoo_apply` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Path.ofContinuousOnIoo_apply_of_mem_Ioo` — its values, in general and on the interior.
* `EpsilonEridani.Path.range_ofContinuousOnIoo` — its range is `closure (g '' Ioo a b)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_or_eq_endpoints_of_notMem_of_forall_mem_Ioo` — the simplicity lemma above; it runs on
  Mathlib's trichotomy `Set.eq_endpoints_or_mem_Ioo_of_mem_Icc`, read on the unit interval.

## Generality

The extension and its continuity are stated over an arbitrary linearly ordered domain with an
order-closed topology; only the path is real, `AffineMap.lineMap` and `unitInterval` being so. The
path and its values ask nothing of `X` beyond a topology; only the range computation is Hausdorff,
the image of a compact set having to be closed there. The simplicity lemma assumes nothing about
`X` at all.

variable {X α : Type*} [LinearOrder α] {a b x : α} {u v : X} {g : α → X}

/-- **A function on an open interval, extended across both of its ends by prescribed values.**
`EpsilonEridani.extendIoo a b u v g` agrees with `g` on `Ioo a b` and takes the value `u` on `Iic a`; when
`a < b` it takes the value `v` on `Ici b`, so that in particular it is `u` at `a` and `v` at `b`.
The two outer branches run over the whole of `Iic a` and `Ici b`, rather than over the endpoints
alone, so that the definition computes everywhere and carries no side condition. The
nondegeneracy `a < b` is not part of the definition, and is needed for the right-hand branch only:
if instead `b ≤ a`, the interval is empty and the extension is `u` on `Iic a` and `v` on `Ioi a`,
so that `b` itself is sent to `u`. The value is therefore computed at every point of `α`,
degenerate intervals included, by `EpsilonEridani.extendIoo_apply_of_mem_Ioo`,
`EpsilonEridani.extendIoo_apply_of_le_left` and `EpsilonEridani.extendIoo_apply_of_left_lt_of_right_le`, whose
hypotheses are exactly the three branch conditions.

Mathlib's `extendFrom` instead *recovers* the end values as limits, which is why its continuity
theorem `continuousOn_Icc_extendFrom_Ioo` asks for a regular codomain and its identification
theorem `eq_lim_at_left_extendFrom_Ioo` for a Hausdorff one. Here the end values are given, and
`EpsilonEridani.continuousOn_Icc_extendIoo` needs neither. -/

  fun x => if x ≤ a then u else if b ≤ x then v else g x

/-- Above the left end and at or above the right end the extension takes the prescribed value `v`.
These are exactly the conditions of the second branch, so together with

extension at every point, degenerate intervals included. -/

/-- **The path traced by a function on an open interval.** If `g` is continuous on `Ioo a b`, tends
