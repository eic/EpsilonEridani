# Covering maps onto a clopen subspace

A covering map `p : E → ↥s` onto a subspace of `X` is also a covering map `E → X` as soon as `s`
is clopen: over a point of `s` an evenly covered neighbourhood in `↥s` is one in `X` because `s`
is open, and over a point outside `s` the open set `sᶜ` has empty preimage, which
`IsEvenlyCovered.of_preimage_eq_empty` accepts as an evenly covered neighbourhood with empty
fibre.

Openness alone is not enough: for `s` open but not closed, a point of `frontier s` has every
neighbourhood meeting `s`, so no neighbourhood of it is evenly covered by a surjection onto `s`.
Mathlib's `IsCoveringMap` allows empty fibres, which is exactly what makes the clopen statement
work without assuming `p` surjective or `s = X`.

## Main declarations

* `IsCoveringMap.subtypeVal_comp`: the composite of a covering map onto a clopen
  subspace with the subspace inclusion is a covering map.
