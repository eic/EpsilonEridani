# Nested intersections of continua

A **continuum** is a nonempty compact connected set. This file proves the standard structural
theorem about them: the intersection of a family of compact connected sets that is *downward
directed* — any two members contain a third — is again compact and connected. Mathlib has the union
counterpart, `IsPreconnected.sUnion_directed`, and Cantor's intersection theorem
`IsCompact.nonempty_iInter_of_directed_nonempty_isCompact_isClosed`, but not the preservation of
connectedness under a directed intersection; this file supplies it.

It is written for `EpsilonEridani/Topology/ClusterSet.lean`, where the boundary cluster set of a map is
exhibited as such an intersection and is thereby a continuum — the first step of the Carathéodory
boundary correspondence, layer **L5** of the conformal-mapping roadmap.

Both hypotheses on the family are essential. Without directedness a circle and a secant line are
two continua meeting in two points, a disconnected intersection. Without compactness the theorem
fails even for a *decreasing sequence*: in `ℝ × ℝ` the closed connected sets
`(ℝ ×ˢ {0}) ∪ (ℝ ×ˢ {1}) ∪ (Ici n ×ˢ Icc 0 1)` — two parallel lines bridged by a strip that
recedes to infinity — intersect in the two lines, which are disconnected.

## The argument

Suppose the intersection `C` splits: `C ⊆ u ∪ v` with `u`, `v` open, both meeting `C`, and
`C ∩ u ∩ v = ∅`. Then `C \ v` and `C \ u` are disjoint nonempty compact sets, so in a Hausdorff
space they have disjoint open neighbourhoods `U` and `V`, and `C ⊆ U ∪ V`. So `U ∪ V` is a
neighbourhood of every point of `C`, and `exists_subset_nhds_of_isCompact` — any neighbourhood of
the intersection of a directed family of compacts already contains one member — supplies a single
`t i` covered by `U ∪ V`. That member meets both `U` and `V` — it contains `C` — so its
connectedness forces `U ∩ V` to be nonempty, a contradiction.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isPreconnected_iInter_of_directed` — a directed intersection of compact preconnected
  sets is preconnected.
* `EpsilonEridani.isConnected_iInter_of_directed` — the continuum form: a directed intersection of
  continua is a continuum.
