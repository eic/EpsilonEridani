# The category of complete separated topological commutative rings

Wedhorn's structure presheaves take values among *complete separated* topological rings
(*Adic Spaces*, arXiv:1910.05934v1, §8.1; roadmap Layer 3.2). This file defines the
predicate and the full subcategory of `TopCommRingCat` it cuts out.

A bare topological ring carries no uniformity, so completeness is stated for the canonical
group uniformity `IsTopologicalAddGroup.rightUniformSpace` of the additive topological
group. Nothing is lost against any other compatible choice:
`IsUniformAddGroup.rightUniformSpace_eq` says every uniformity making the ring a uniform
additive group with this topology *equals* the canonical one, and the introduction and
elimination lemmas below package that transfer so consumers never perform it by hand.
Separatedness is stated as `T0Space`, with `IsCompleteSeparated.t2Space` providing the
Hausdorff form the equalizer arguments consume.

The predicate pins that uniformity explicitly, so that it does not depend on what is in
scope; the `scoped instance`s `uniformSpace` and `isUniformAddGroup` then make it ambient, so
proofs inside `EpsilonEridani.TopCommRingCat` speak of `CompleteSpace R` directly instead of opening
with a uniformity preamble.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.TopCommRingCat.IsCompleteSeparated`: complete and Hausdorff for the group
  uniformity of the topology.
* `EpsilonEridani.TopCommRingCat.isCompleteSeparated`: the same, as a named `ObjectProperty`.
* `EpsilonEridani.TopCommRingCat.uniformSpace` and `EpsilonEridani.TopCommRingCat.isUniformAddGroup`: that
  group uniformity on every object, as `scoped instance`s.
* `EpsilonEridani.CompleteSeparatedTopCommRingCat`: the full subcategory of `TopCommRingCat` on
  the complete separated objects, with `CompleteSeparatedTopCommRingCat.of` and element
  coercion.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.TopCommRingCat.isCompleteSeparated_of_completeSpace_of_t0Space` and
  `EpsilonEridani.TopCommRingCat.completeSpace_of_isCompleteSeparated` : the transfer in and out of
  the predicate for a ring carrying its own compatible uniformity. Applied at a completion
  it gives the canonical witnesses — the family the structure presheaf's values come from —
  as the `example` below records.
* `EpsilonEridani.TopCommRingCat.IsCompleteSeparated.t2Space` : separatedness in Hausdorff form.
* `EpsilonEridani.TopCommRingCat.IsCompleteSeparated.of_isClosedEmbedding` : a closed subobject of a
  complete separated ring is complete separated. Closedness of the range is what supplies
  completeness, and separatedness is inherited along the embedding. Its consumers are the
  `IsClosedUnderIsomorphisms` instance below, which needs no Hausdorffness because an
  isomorphism is already a closed embedding, and the equalizer closure in
  `CompleteSeparated/Limits.lean`, which is where the Hausdorffness input sits.
* The `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.IsClosedUnderIsomorphisms` instance for
  `EpsilonEridani.TopCommRingCat.isCompleteSeparated` : the property transfers along isomorphisms,
  an isomorphism being in particular a closed embedding — read off `TopCat.homeoOfIso`.
* `EpsilonEridani.TopCommRingCat.IsCompleteSeparated.pi` : a product of complete separated objects
  is complete separated. This is the closure half for products; the closure instance it feeds,
  the products that instance supplies to `CompleteSeparatedTopCommRingCat`, and their creation
  by the inclusion `CompleteSeparatedTopCommRingCat ⥤ TopCommRingCat` (roadmap Layer 3.2) are
  in `CompleteSeparated/Limits.lean`.

/-- A topological commutative ring is **complete separated** when it is complete and
Hausdorff for the group uniformity `IsTopologicalAddGroup.rightUniformSpace` of its
topology. This is Wedhorn's standing convention that "complete" includes "Hausdorff"
(*Adic Spaces*, §5.3); separatedness is stated as `T0Space`, with
`IsCompleteSeparated.t2Space` supplying the Hausdorff form. -/

/-- The group uniformity of the topology, on every object. It is `scoped` because it is a

`IsCompleteSeparated` is stated for, so with it in scope a proof can say `CompleteSpace R`
without first installing the uniformity by hand. -/

/-- A closed embedding of topological rings pulls the complete separated property back: the
range is closed in a complete space, hence complete, and `IsUniformInducing.completeSpace`
carries completeness back along the embedding, while `IsEmbedding.t0Space` inherits
separatedness. Completeness itself asks for no separation axiom; Hausdorffness enters one
level up, in the equalizer closure in `CompleteSeparated/Limits.lean` that produces the closed
embedding. -/

`IsCompleteSeparated.of_isClosedEmbedding` applied to the inverse. That `e.inv` is a closed

`rfl`, through `forget₂`, `mapIso` and `TopCat.homeoOfIso` in turn. -/
