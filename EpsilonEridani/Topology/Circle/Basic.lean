# A point of the circle and its inverse

Mathlib's `Circle` is the unit circle of `ℂ` as a group. This file records when a point of it is
separated from its inverse: `z - z⁻¹` vanishes exactly at the two square roots of `1`, the points
`z = ±1`. The chord and arc geometry of the circle is
`EpsilonEridani/Topology/Circle/Metric.lean`; this is the algebraic fact that precedes it.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.circle_sub_inv_ne_zero` — `z - z⁻¹ ≠ 0` for a point `z` of the circle with `z² ≠ 1`.
