# The closed and open arcs of the circle

Mathlib's `Circle.exp` parametrizes the circle by angles. This file reads a *closed arc*
`Circle.exp '' Set.Icc a b` off a subset of the circle and identifies its complement: a nonempty
closed preconnected proper subset of the circle is such an arc, and the complement of a closed arc
is the open arc `Circle.exp '' Set.Ioo b (a + 2 * π)` spanning the complementary angles.

Nothing here is specific to any curve theory; as with `EpsilonEridani/Topology/Circle/Metric.lean`, these
are facts about the model circle, and the transport of them to a Jordan curve — where a compact
connected subset of the curve is thereby classified — is
`EpsilonEridani/Topology/JordanCurve/Subcontinuum.lean`.

## The argument

The argument is the one for `ℝ`, run on a period of angles. Let `T ⊆ Circle` be closed,
preconnected and not the whole circle, and pick `z ∉ T`. Cutting the circle at `z` — that is,
reading it as `Circle.exp` on the period `[t, t + 2π]` for `Circle.exp t = z` — turns `T` into
`K = Circle.exp ⁻¹' T ∩ Icc t (t + 2 * π)`, a compact subset of `ℝ` avoiding *both* endpoints of
that period, so `K ⊆ Ioo t (t + 2 * π)` and `Circle.exp` is injective on `K`. A continuous injection
of a compact space into a Hausdorff one is a closed embedding (`Continuous.isClosedEmbedding`),
hence inducing, and an inducing map reflects preconnectedness
(`Topology.IsInducing.isPreconnected_image`), which carries preconnectedness of
`T = Circle.exp '' K` back to `K`; a compact connected subset of `ℝ` is then a closed interval
(`eq_Icc_of_connected_compact`).
Hence `T = Circle.exp '' Icc a b` with `b - a < 2 * π`, the degenerate case `a = b` being a point.

The complement is read off the same period, moved to `Ioc b (b + 2 * π)` so that the closed arc
becomes `Icc (a + 2 * π) (b + 2 * π)` and injectivity of `Circle.exp` applies to the difference.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_eq_circleExp_image_Icc` — a nonempty closed preconnected proper subset of the
  circle is `Circle.exp '' Set.Icc a b` for a pair of angles less than a full turn apart.
* `EpsilonEridani.compl_circleExp_image_Icc` — the complement of such a closed arc is the open arc
  `Circle.exp '' Set.Ioo b (a + 2 * π)`.

`b - a` less than a full turn. Nothing ties the angles to a period, so a consumer may translate them
by any multiple of `2 * π`. -/

/-- **A nonempty closed preconnected proper subset of the circle is a closed arc.** The two angles
are less than a full turn apart, so `Circle.exp` is injective on the interval carrying them, and the
degenerate case `a = b` is a single point.

Closedness is what forces the arc to be closed: the set is compact, `Circle` being compact, and a
compact connected subset of the line is a closed interval. -/

/-- **The complement of a closed arc of the circle is the complementary open arc.** The two arcs
share their endpoints' angles: `Circle.exp '' Set.Icc a b` is complemented by
`Circle.exp '' Set.Ioo b (a + 2 * π)`, which is nonempty exactly because the closed arc is not the
whole circle. Read left to right this removes a complement, so it is the normal form a consumer
