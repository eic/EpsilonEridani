# Point-set topology of path components

Paths and path homotopies based in `pathComponent x₀` remain in that component, without any
local path-connectedness assumption. This gives path connectedness of the component as a
subspace; under local path connectedness of the ambient space, openness of path components also
gives local path connectedness of the subspace.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.homotopic_pathComponent_of_map_subtypeVal_homotopic`: path homotopies reflect along
  the inclusion of a path component.
* Instances making `↥(pathComponent x₀)` path connected and locally path connected.
* `EpsilonEridani.pathComponentSelf`: a point viewed in its own path component.

## References

This supplies point-set prerequisites for the "or one builds the cover of `pathComponent x₀`"
clause in `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/UniversalCovers/README.md`.
