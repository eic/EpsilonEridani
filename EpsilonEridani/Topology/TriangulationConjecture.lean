# The triangulation conjecture

The **triangulation conjecture** in dimension `n` asserts that every closed topological
`n`-manifold is homeomorphic to the geometric realization of an abstract simplicial complex.
Here a closed topological `n`-manifold is a compact Hausdorff space carrying charts to
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`; no smooth, PL, or other compatibility of the transition maps is
imposed. Second countability is not assumed separately, since a compact space locally
homeomorphic to Euclidean space is second countable
(`ChartedSpace.secondCountable_of_sigmaCompact`). The Hausdorff hypothesis is essential: a
realization is Hausdorff, so without it a compact non-Hausdorff locally Euclidean space would
refute the conjecture for a trivial reason.

The conclusion uses the general predicate `EpsilonEridani.IsTriangulable`, which imposes no link
condition on the triangulating complex. This is the form relevant to Manolescu's theorem:
for every `n ≥ 5` there is a closed topological `n`-manifold admitting no triangulation at all,
that is `∀ n, 5 ≤ n → ¬ EpsilonEridani.TriangulationConjecture n`. The older Kirby–Siebenmann result
instead gives the weaker conclusion that some manifolds admit no combinatorial triangulation;
combinatorial triangulability (`EpsilonEridani.IsCombinatoriallyTriangulable`) is itself the stronger
notion because it imposes an additional link condition.

The conjecture is stated, not proved. It holds in dimension zero, where every such space is
discrete (`EpsilonEridani.triangulationConjecture_zero`); it is also known in dimensions at most three
(Radó, Moise), fails in dimension four by the work of Freedman and Casson, and fails in every
dimension at least five by Manolescu.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.TriangulationConjecture`: every closed topological `n`-manifold is triangulable.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.not_triangulationConjecture_iff`: a disproof is a closed topological manifold that is
  not triangulable, the shape of Manolescu's theorem.
* `EpsilonEridani.isTriangulable_of_chartedSpace_zero`: every space locally homeomorphic to `ℝ⁰` is
  triangulable.
* `EpsilonEridani.triangulationConjecture_zero`: the conjecture holds in dimension zero.
