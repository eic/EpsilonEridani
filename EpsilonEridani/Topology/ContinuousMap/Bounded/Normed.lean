# Norm bounds for bounded continuous functions

This file records norm estimates for operations on bounded continuous functions.

The main estimate, `EpsilonEridani.norm_boundedContinuousFunction_comp_le`, bounds the sup norm of the
postcomposition `N ∘ f` of a bounded continuous function `f` by an `ε`-Lipschitz map `N` by
`‖N 0‖ + ε * ‖f‖`. Thus a globally Lipschitz nonlinearity maps bounded continuous functions to
bounded ones with an explicit affine norm bound. In `EpsilonEridani.Analysis.ODE.LyapunovPerron.Basic` it
supplies the uniform bound on the forcing term `s ↦ N (γ s)` that makes the Lyapunov–Perron
integral converge and defines the Lyapunov–Perron operator on bounded continuous curves.
