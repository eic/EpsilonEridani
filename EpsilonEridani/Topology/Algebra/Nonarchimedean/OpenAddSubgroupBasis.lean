# The open subgroups of a nonarchimedean group are a basis of the neighbourhoods of zero

`NonarchimedeanAddGroup` is stated as an existence property — every neighbourhood of zero contains
an open subgroup — and the filter-basis form is what consumers actually use. This module records
that form once.

It is deliberately separate from
`EpsilonEridani/Topology/Algebra/Nonarchimedean/FirstCountable.lean`, where this statement previously
lived as a `have` inside `NonarchimedeanAddGroup.exists_antitone_basis_openAddSubgroup`: that
theorem additionally assumes `(𝓝 0).IsCountablyGenerated`, which it needs only to extract an
antitone *sequence* from the basis. The basis itself needs no countability, so hiding it inside a
first-countability result put a countability hypothesis on a statement that does not use one.
