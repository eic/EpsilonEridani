# The neighbourhood basis of a submodules basis, and when two of them agree

Mathlib's `SubmodulesBasis B` turns a family `B : ι → Submodule R M` into a topology on `M`,
`SubmodulesBasis.topology`, by routing the family through
`SubmodulesBasis.toModuleFilterBasis`. That route leaves the neighbourhoods of `0` indexed by
*sets* `U` carrying a proof `∃ i, U = B i` rather than by `ι`. This file adds the `ι`-indexed
form, which Mathlib already has one level down for subgroups as
`RingSubgroupsBasis.hasBasis_nhds_zero`, and the comparison lemma it makes routine: two
submodule bases on the same module that are mutually cofinal induce the same topology.

Neither statement mentions anything beyond `SubmodulesBasis`, so both live in that namespace
rather than in a `EpsilonEridani` one.

## Main results

* `SubmodulesBasis.hasBasis_nhds_zero`: the family is itself a neighbourhood basis at `0` for
  the topology it induces — a set is a neighbourhood of `0` exactly when it contains some
  `B i`.
* `SubmodulesBasis.topology_eq`: mutually cofinal submodule bases induce the same topology.

## References

* Mathlib's `Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Nonarchimedean/Bases.lean`, whose
  `RingSubgroupsBasis.hasBasis_nhds_zero` the first result mirrors.

/-- **The family is a neighbourhood basis at `0`**, indexed by `ι`: a set is a neighbourhood of
`0` for the induced topology exactly when it contains some `B i`.

Mathlib reaches the same filter only through `SubmodulesBasis.toModuleFilterBasis`, whose basis
is indexed by the sets `U` with `∃ i, U = B i`; this is the `ι`-indexed form, mirroring
`RingSubgroupsBasis.hasBasis_nhds_zero`. -/
theorem hasBasis_nhds_zero [Nonempty ι] (hB : SubmodulesBasis B) :
    (@nhds M hB.topology 0).HasBasis (fun _ : ι ↦ True) fun i ↦ (B i : Set M) :=

    (by rintro _ ⟨i, rfl⟩; exact ⟨i, trivial, subset_rfl⟩)
    (fun i _ ↦ ⟨B i, ⟨i, rfl⟩, subset_rfl⟩)

/-- **Mutually cofinal submodule bases induce the same topology.** If every `B i` contains some
`B' j` and every `B' j` contains some `B i`, the two families are neighbourhood bases at `0` for
the same filter, and both topologies are additive group topologies, so they agree everywhere.

No relation between the two index types is needed, and neither family need be antitone: cofinality
in both directions is the whole hypothesis. -/
