# A quotient of a nonarchimedean group is nonarchimedean

`NonarchimedeanGroup G` asks that every neighbourhood of `1` contain an *open subgroup*. That
property passes to `G ⧸ N`, and the proof is the one-line reason it should: the quotient map is
open, so it carries an open subgroup at `1` to one downstairs.

This is a statement about topological groups, not about rings: nothing in it uses
multiplication on a ring or the ideal structure of `I`. It is therefore proved at the group
level and transported with `@[to_additive]`, and the ring statement is derived from the additive
one rather than reproved — the same way Mathlib derives `NonarchimedeanRing (R × S)` from the
additive group instance on a product.

Both instances factor through one transport lemma,
`NonarchimedeanGroup.nonarchimedean_of_isOpenMap` in
`EpsilonEridani.Topology.Algebra.Nonarchimedean.Basic`: the property passes along *any* open homomorphism
continuous at the identity, which is all the quotient map is ever used for here. The group
instance applies it to `QuotientGroup.mk'`, and the ring instance applies
its additive form to `Ideal.Quotient.mk` through `QuotientRing.isOpenMap_coe` — so no
identification of `R ⧸ I` with a quotient by `I.toAddSubgroup` is involved. The module instance
applies the additive form to `Submodule.mkQ` through `Submodule.isOpenMap_mkQ` in the same way.

The consumer is the universal property of a rational localisation
(`EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_completion_locTopology`), which
requires `[NonarchimedeanRing B]` on its target. Wedhorn's Example 6.38 presents a rational
localisation as a quotient `C ⧸ a` of a ring of restricted power series, so applying that
universal property to `C ⧸ a` needs exactly the ring instance below.

## Main results

* `QuotientGroup.instNonarchimedeanGroup`, and its additive form
  `QuotientAddGroup.instNonarchimedeanAddGroup`: `G ⧸ N` is nonarchimedean when `G` is.
* `Ideal.Quotient.instNonarchimedeanRing`: `R ⧸ I` is nonarchimedean when `R` is.
* `Submodule.Quotient.instNonarchimedeanAddGroup`: `M ⧸ N` is nonarchimedean when the topological
  module `M` is.
