# Maximal ideals of complete linearly topologized rings

In a complete linearly topologized commutative ring, topologically nilpotent elements lie in
every maximal ideal: if `a ∉ 𝔪` then `1 = r·a + m` with `m ∈ 𝔪`, and `m = 1 - r·a` is a unit by
the geometric series (Proposition 5.38), contradicting properness. Consequently, as soon as the
topologically nilpotent locus is open — as it is for a Huber ring — every maximal ideal is open,
being a neighborhood of each of its points.

These are the openness inputs of Wedhorn's Propositions 7.51 and 7.52 (see
`EpsilonEridani.AlgebraicGeometry.AdicSpace.Spa.Points`), stated here beside the completeness input
`IsTopologicallyNilpotent.isUnit_one_sub` they consume, since neither mentions a valuation
spectrum.

## Main results

* `IsTopologicallyNilpotent.mem_of_isMaximal` : topologically nilpotent elements lie in every
  maximal ideal.
* `Ideal.isOpen_of_isMaximal_of_isOpen_isTopologicallyNilpotent` : every maximal ideal is open
  once the topologically nilpotent locus is.

## Provenance

Adapted from AINTLIB (see References), section `TopNilMaximal` of the source file: the
geometric-series argument for maximal membership and the translation argument for openness are
that file's, with the openness proof rerouted through `AddSubgroup.isOpen_of_mem_nhds`.
