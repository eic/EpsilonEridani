# The geometric series in a complete nonarchimedean ring

**Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*, Proposition 5.38.** In a complete nonarchimedean topological ring,
`1 - a` is a unit for every topologically nilpotent `a`.

Nonarchimedean is what makes this cheap. In a general topological ring the geometric series need
not converge just because its terms tend to `0`, but in a complete nonarchimedean additive group
summability is *equivalent* to the terms tending to zero along the cofinite filter
(`NonarchimedeanAddGroup.summable_iff_tendsto_cofinite_zero`, which is where completeness is
consumed) — and for the powers of `a` that is precisely topological nilpotence. Mathlib's
`Summable.one_sub_mul_tsum_pow` and `Summable.tsum_pow_mul_one_sub` then exhibit `∑ aⁿ` as a
two-sided inverse.

What is exported is unit-hood alone; a consumer wanting the inverse should use
`ha.summable_pow.one_sub_mul_tsum_pow` directly.

Mathlib has the analytic counterpart, `isUnit_one_sub_of_norm_lt_one`, which needs a norm; the
nonarchimedean-topological statement is what the Huber theory uses, since a Huber ring carries no
canonical norm.

## Main results

* `IsTopologicallyNilpotent.summable_pow` : the geometric series `∑ aⁿ` is summable.
* `IsTopologicallyNilpotent.isUnit_one_sub` : the unit-hood half of Proposition 5.38.
* `IsTopologicallyNilpotent.isUnit_one_add` : the `1 + a` form, which is the one consumers want.

## Provenance

Ported from AINTLIB's `projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/GeometricSeries.lean`, branch
`dev/adic-spaces`, commit `37bbdaeb`, Apache-2.0, Chris Birkbeck. The proofs are AINTLIB's and rest
entirely on Mathlib primitives. Two deliberate differences from the source: the ring here is only a
`Ring`, the unit being built from both one-sided geometric identities instead of from
commutativity; and the negation-stability lemma the `1 + a` form needs lives in
`EpsilonEridani/Topology/Algebra/TopologicallyNilpotent.lean`, stated at the hypotheses it actually
requires rather than under this file's uniform nonarchimedean block. The `omit` annotations record
which hypotheses each proof uses.
