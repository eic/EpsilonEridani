# Cofinite convergence in a nonarchimedean group is a finiteness condition

In a nonarchimedean additive group the open subgroups form a basis of neighbourhoods of zero, so
a family converges to zero along the cofinite filter exactly when each open subgroup omits only
finitely many of its members.

The `→` direction is available in any topological additive group: an open subgroup is a
neighbourhood of zero, so cofinitely many members lie in it. It is nonarchimedeanness that gives
the converse, and with it the upgrade from a *consequence* of convergence to a *criterion* for it.

Nothing here looks at the index type, so it is arbitrary.

/-- **Cofinite convergence, as a finiteness condition on open subgroups.** A family tends to `0`
along the cofinite filter exactly when, for every open additive subgroup `W`, all but finitely
many of its members lie in `W`.

Both directions are the single fact that the open subgroups are a basis of `𝓝 0`
(`NonarchimedeanAddGroup.nhds_zero_hasBasis_openAddSubgroup`), read through
`Filter.HasBasis.tendsto_right_iff`: convergence along a filter is membership of each basic
neighbourhood eventually, and `Filter.eventually_cofinite` turns "eventually along `cofinite`"
into the finiteness of the exceptional set. -/
