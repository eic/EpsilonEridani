# Profinite groups are nonarchimedean

A topological group is *nonarchimedean* when every neighbourhood of the identity contains an open
subgroup. In a compact totally disconnected topological group every open neighbourhood of the
identity contains an open normal subgroup, which is Mathlib's
`ProfiniteGrp.exist_openNormalSubgroup_sub_open_nhds_of_one`; this file records the consequence
as the `NonarchimedeanGroup` instance, so that everything Mathlib and Tau Ceti prove about
nonarchimedean groups — the basis of open subgroups at the identity, the transport to quotients
and subgroups, total separatedness of Hausdorff nonarchimedean groups — applies to profinite
groups and to compact totally disconnected topological modules without further argument.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsTopologicalGroup.nonarchimedeanGroup_of_compactSpace`, and its additive form
  `EpsilonEridani.IsTopologicalAddGroup.nonarchimedeanAddGroup_of_compactSpace`: a compact totally
  disconnected topological group is nonarchimedean.
