# Powers of the ideal defining an adic topology

For an ideal `I` of a commutative ring `R`, Mathlib's `Ideal.openAddSubgroup` records that each
power `I ^ n` is an open additive subgroup **of `R` carried with the topology `I.adicTopology`**.
A ring is usually met the other way round: it comes with a topology already, and `IsAdic I` is
the statement that this topology *is* the `I`-adic one. The results here transport such facts
across that equation — the openness, the complementary closedness, and the topological
nilpotence of the elements of `I` — so that a ring satisfying `IsAdic I` may be used directly.

Closedness is the form these are wanted in: an infinite sum all of whose terms lie in `I ^ n`
again lies in `I ^ n`, because `I ^ n` is closed and `tsum_mem` applies. That is how a power
series evaluated at arguments of `I ^ n` is confined to `I ^ n`, in
`EpsilonEridani.RingTheory.MvPowerSeries.Evaluation`.

## Main results

* `IsAdic.isOpen_pow` : in a ring whose topology is `I`-adic, every power of `I` is open.
* `IsAdic.isClosed_pow` : in a ring whose topology is `I`-adic, every power of `I` is closed —
  an open additive subgroup of a topological group being closed.
* `IsAdic.tendsto_zero_of_mem_pow` : a family whose members lie in growing powers of `I` tends to
  zero, provided the exponents tend to infinity.
* `IsAdic.isTopologicallyNilpotent_of_mem` : in a ring whose topology is `I`-adic, every element
  of `I` is topologically nilpotent.
* `IsAdic.isTopologicallyNilpotent_iff_mem_radical` : conversely, a topologically nilpotent
  element has a power in `I`, so the topologically nilpotent elements are exactly the radical
  of `I`.
* `IsAdic.isLinearTopology` : a ring whose topology is `I`-adic is linearly topologized, the
  `IsAdic` counterpart of `Ideal.isLinearTopology`.

since convergence along `l` cannot see failures outside an `l`-large set; a pointwise caller
supplies `Filter.Eventually.of_forall`. The index filter is arbitrary: `atTop` for a sequence,
`cofinite` for the decay condition of `MvPowerSeries.HasEval`. For the powers of a single element
