# Negation and topological nilpotence

Mathlib closes `IsTopologicallyNilpotent` under the operations that a topology on the ring makes
available — `zero`, `add`, `mul_left`, `mul_right`, `map` — but not under negation. This file adds
that, at the hypotheses the statement needs: a `MonoidWithZero` with a distributive negation, and
continuity of negation.

No uniformity, nonarchimedean neighbourhood basis or commutativity is involved. `(-a) ^ n` is
`a ^ n` for even `n` and `-(a ^ n)` for odd `n`, and both of those sequences tend to `0` as soon as
negation is continuous, so every neighbourhood of `0` eventually contains `(-a) ^ n` whichever
parity `n` has.

## Main results

* `IsTopologicallyNilpotent.neg` : the negation of a topologically nilpotent element is
  topologically nilpotent.
* `isTopologicallyNilpotent_neg` : the same fact as a `simp` iff, mirroring `isPowerBounded_neg`.
* `eventually_mul_pow_mem_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent`, and its `.exists` form: a topologically
  nilpotent element absorbs any fixed element into any open subring.

## Provenance

The statement is AINTLIB's `IsTopologicallyNilpotent.neg`, branch `dev/adic-spaces`, commit
`37bbdaeb`, Apache-2.0, Chris Birkbeck, `projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/GeometricSeries.lean`.
There it sits inside the geometric-series development over a complete nonarchimedean uniform
commutative ring, and the sign on the odd powers is absorbed by an open subgroup. Only the
statement is followed here: the hypotheses are weakened to the ones the result needs, and the
open-subgroup step is replaced by the two-sequence argument above, which needs no nonarchimedean
basis. The iff form has no counterpart in the source.

variable {A : Type*} [Ring A] [TopologicalSpace A] [SeparatelyContinuousMul A]

/-- **A topologically nilpotent element absorbs any element into any open subring.** For `s`
topologically nilpotent and `B` open, `a * s ^ n` lies in `B` for all large `n`.

Multiplication by `a` is continuous, so `B` pulls back to a neighbourhood of `0`, and the powers of
`s` converge to `0`. Neither commutativity nor continuity of addition is used — only
`SeparatelyContinuousMul` — and no Huber structure enters, which is why this sits here rather than
beside the ring-of-definition form it generalises,
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.exists_pow_idealOfDefinition_mul_mem`. -/
