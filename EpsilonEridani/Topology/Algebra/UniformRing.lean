# Ring homomorphisms out of a completion

Results about `UniformSpace.Completion` as a *ring*. Those about the completion itself live in
the root `UniformSpace.Completion` namespace they extend; `RingHom.completionCoe_comp_heq`, whose
subject is the homomorphism being followed by the coercion, lives in `RingHom` so that it is
available by dot notation on that map.

`UniformSpace.Completion.ringHom_ext_of_continuous` is `UniformSpace.Completion.ext` for ring
homomorphisms: two continuous ring homomorphisms out of `Completion R` that agree after composing
with the coercion from `R` are equal. `R` is a topological ring carrying a compatible uniform
additive-group structure, and nothing more: neither `CompleteSpace` nor `T0Space` is required, and
`R` need not be commutative. It lives here because it is a statement about the completion functor
rather than about any ring being completed, and it is what lets
consumers state uniqueness on the base ring instead of on the completion.

## The completion of a complete separated ring is itself

`UniformSpace.Completion.completeRingEquivSelf`: for a complete Hausdorff topological ring
`S`, the extension of the identity is a ring isomorphism `UniformSpace.Completion S ≃+* S`.
The ring homomorphism is `UniformSpace.Completion.extensionHom`; its underlying function is
that of the uniform bijection `UniformCompletion.completeEquivSelf` — the equality is
recorded as `coe_extensionHom_id` — which supplies bijectivity. The name follows
`UniformCompletion.completeEquivSelf`.

The rest of the self-equivalence material is read off that identification. The isomorphism
is uniformly continuous
because `UniformCompletion.completeEquivSelf` is a uniform equivalence, and its inverse is
uniformly continuous because it *is* the canonical map into the completion. Over a base ring
`R` acting by *uniformly continuous* scalar multiplication the same map is `R`-linear, giving
`UniformSpace.Completion.completeAlgEquivSelf`. Uniform continuity of the action is not a
convenience: it is what makes the completion an `R`-algebra in the first place, since that is
what `UniformSpace.Completion.algebra` requires.

The declarations live in the root `UniformSpace.Completion` namespace they extend, following
this repository's convention for lemmas about external types.

`RingHom.completionCoe_comp_heq` compares the coercion for two *equal* uniformities on the same
ring: following a fixed map by the coercion gives heterogeneously equal composites. It is stated
here rather than where it is consumed because nothing in it is specific to any particular ring
being completed.

## Main definitions

* `UniformSpace.Completion.completeRingEquivSelf`: the ring isomorphism
  `UniformSpace.Completion S ≃+* S`.
* `UniformSpace.Completion.completeAlgEquivSelf`: the same map as an `R`-algebra equivalence,
  for a complete Hausdorff topological `R`-algebra `S` whose scalar multiplication by `R` is
  uniformly continuous (`UniformContinuousConstSMul R S`).

## Main results

* `RingHom.completionCoe_comp_heq`: equal uniformities on the codomain give heterogeneously equal
  composites with the coercion into the completion.

* `UniformSpace.Completion.ringHom_ext_of_continuous`: two continuous ring homomorphisms out of
  a completion that agree on the image of the coercion are equal.
* `UniformSpace.Completion.coe_completeRingEquivSelf` and
  `UniformSpace.Completion.coe_completeRingEquivSelf_symm`: the isomorphism is
  `UniformCompletion.completeEquivSelf` and its inverse is the coercion into the completion.
* `UniformSpace.Completion.uniformContinuous_completeRingEquivSelf` and
  `UniformSpace.Completion.uniformContinuous_completeRingEquivSelf_symm`: both directions are
  uniformly continuous, hence continuous by `UniformContinuous.continuous`.

/-- **Following a fixed map by the coercion into a completion depends on the uniformity only
through the instance.** For two equal uniformities on `S`, the composites
`R →+* S → UniformSpace.Completion S` agree.

The conclusion is `HEq` rather than `=` because the type `UniformSpace.Completion S` mentions the
uniformity on `S`, so the two composites do not share a codomain. A caller holding an equation
between uniformities — rather than a defeq — is the intended consumer. -/

This is `UniformSpace.Completion.ext` packaged for ring homomorphisms: composing with `coeRingHom`
is restriction along the coercion, and density of the image does the rest. Nothing is asked of `B`
beyond a non-associative semiring structure and a Hausdorff topology — no compatibility between the
two is used — and `R` need not be commutative. -/
