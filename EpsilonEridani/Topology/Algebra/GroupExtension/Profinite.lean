# Profinite extensions by a compact kernel are twisted products

A group extension `1 → M → E → G → 1` is an extension *of topological groups* when its inclusion
and its projection are continuous. This file proves that, when `E` is profinite and the kernel `M`
is compact — in the application of the extension dictionary, finite and discrete — such an
extension is the twisted product of `G` by `M` built from a continuous factor set:

* the projection has a continuous normalized set-theoretic section
  (`EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.exists_continuous_section`);
* the factor set that section measures is continuous
  (`EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.continuous_factorSet`);
* the comparison map from the twisted product back to `E` is a multiplicative equivalence and a
  homeomorphism (`EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.factorSetContinuousMulEquiv`), assembled into
  `EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.exists_continuous_factorSet`.

In the other direction `EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.factorSet_canonicalSection` reads a factor set back
off the twisted product it builds, through the canonical section, which is continuous by
`EpsilonEridani.FactorSet.continuous_canonicalSection`. So the two constructions are mutually inverse up
to equivalence of extensions.

The continuous section is the only step that uses the topology of `E` in an essential way. It comes
from the continuous section of a profinite group over the quotient by a closed subgroup, applied to
the kernel, which is closed because it is compact and `E`, being profinite, is Hausdorff. Nothing
asks the kernel to be *open*: an open kernel would force `G` to be discrete, whereas the extensions
this dictionary is used on have infinite `G`.

Bundling the data, `EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension G M` is an extension of `G` by `M` with
profinite total group, continuous inclusion and projection, inducing the given action of `G` on
`M`. When `G` and `M` are both profinite the twisted product of a continuous factor set is one
(`EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension.ofFactorSet`); compactness of `M` alone would not do, the
twisted product being `M × G` as a space. The continuous cohomology classifying these bundled
extensions is the subject of `EpsilonEridani/Topology/Algebra/GroupExtension/Cohomology.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension`: an extension of `G` by `M` with profinite total group,
  continuous inclusion and projection, inducing the given action, bundled with its total group, and
  `EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension.ofFactorSet`, the twisted product of a continuous factor set
  when `G` and `M` are profinite.
* `EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.continuousMulEquivOfEquiv`: an equivalence of extensions with compact
  total group is a homeomorphism as soon as it is continuous, hence a `ContinuousMulEquiv`, and
  `EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.continuousMulEquivOfMonoidHom` is its form for a bare morphism. Neither
  assumes the group operations continuous, so neither is stated as an isomorphism of topological
  groups.
* `EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.factorSetContinuousMulEquiv`: the extension is the twisted product built
  from the factor set of a continuous normalized section, by a multiplicative equivalence that is a
  homeomorphism.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.isClosed_ker_rightHom`: a compact kernel is a closed subgroup of a
  Hausdorff extension.
* `EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.exists_continuous_section`: the projection of a profinite extension with
  compact kernel has a continuous normalized section.
* `EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.continuous_factorSet`: the factor set of a continuous normalized section
  is continuous whenever the inclusion of the kernel is an embedding, as a compact kernel of a
  Hausdorff extension is.
* `EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.exists_continuous_factorSet`: **a profinite extension with compact kernel
  is the twisted product of a continuous factor set.**
