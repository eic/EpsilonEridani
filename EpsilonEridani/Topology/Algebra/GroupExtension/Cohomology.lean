# Continuous `H²` classifies profinite extensions

Let `G` be a topological group acting continuously on a commutative topological group `M`. A
continuous factor set `α : FactorSet G M` — a normalized multiplicative `2`-cocycle that is
continuous as a function on `G × G` — is a continuous `2`-cocycle of the explicit complex of
continuous cochains once it is read additively, so it has a class in the explicit continuous
cohomology group `H²(G, M) = Z²/B²` of `EpsilonEridani.ContCohomology.H2`. This file builds that class and
proves that it is a complete invariant of `α` modulo *continuous* coboundaries: two continuous
factor sets have the same class exactly when their quotient is the coboundary of a continuous
function (`EpsilonEridani.FactorSet.contCohomologyClass_eq_iff`), and every class is the class of a
continuous factor set (`EpsilonEridani.FactorSet.exists_contCohomologyClass_eq`). So the class descends
to a bijection `EpsilonEridani.FactorSet.contCohomologyClassEquiv` from the continuous factor sets modulo
continuous cohomology onto `H²(G, M)`.

Read through the extension dictionary, this classifies extensions of topological groups. Consider
an extension `1 → M → E → G → 1` of topological groups inducing the given action of `G` on `M`,
whose kernel is embedded (`S.inl` is an embedding) and which has a continuous normalized section.
It has a class, that of the factor set of the section, which does not depend on the section
(`EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.contCohomologyClass_factorSet_eq`); two such extensions, both with
continuous projection, are equivalent by a continuous equivalence exactly when their classes agree
(`EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.exists_equiv_continuous_iff_contCohomologyClass_factorSet_eq`), and equal
classes even yield a homeomorphic equivalence
(`EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.exists_equiv_isHomeomorph_of_contCohomologyClass_factorSet_eq`); and the
class vanishes exactly when the extension has a continuous homomorphic section
(`EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.exists_splitting_continuous_iff_contCohomologyClass_factorSet_eq_zero`).
For a **profinite** extension with compact kernel a continuous normalized section always exists, so
the class is an invariant of the extension itself, `GroupExtension.contCohomologyClass`, and the
two theorems take their final form
(`GroupExtension.exists_equiv_continuous_iff_contCohomologyClass_eq`,
`GroupExtension.exists_splitting_continuous_iff_contCohomologyClass_eq_zero`). When `G` and `M`
are both profinite the twisted product of a continuous factor set is such an extension, the bundled
`EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension.ofFactorSet` of
`EpsilonEridani/Topology/Algebra/GroupExtension/Profinite.lean`, and its class, read through the canonical
section, is the class of the factor set
(`EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension.contCohomologyClass_ofFactorSet`), so every class of `H²(G, M)`
is the class of a profinite extension. On the bundled profinite extensions
`EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension` of `G` by `M` inducing the given action, the class therefore
descends to the bijection `EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension.contCohomologyClassEquiv` from the
profinite extensions modulo continuous equivalence onto `H²(G, M)`. The trivial class is that of
the trivial factor set (`EpsilonEridani.FactorSet.contCohomologyClass_trivial`), whose twisted product is
the semidirect product.

The classification is natural in the coefficient module. A continuous `G`-equivariant homomorphism
`f : M →*[G] N` of profinite modules pushes a factor set forward (`EpsilonEridani.FactorSet.map`) and a
profinite extension forward (`EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension.map`, the twisted product of the
pushforward of the factor set of a continuous section), and in both cases the class of the
pushforward is the image of the class under the coefficient map
`EpsilonEridani.ContCohomology.explicitCoeff2` of `f`, read additively
(`EpsilonEridani.FactorSet.contCohomologyClass_map`,
`EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension.contCohomologyClass_map`). So the bijection commutes with
pushforward (`EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension.contCohomologyClassEquiv_map`).

The coboundaries here are those of the *continuous* complex, `B²` being the image of the
continuous `1`-cochains; this is what makes the classification a statement about topological
extensions. The abstract classification of `EpsilonEridani/GroupTheory/GroupExtension/Cohomology.lean`
divides by all coboundaries and classifies abstract extensions. The continuous and the abstract
class of a factor set are different invariants, and it is the continuous one that the cohomology of
a profinite group computes with.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.FactorSet.contCohomologyClass`: the class of a continuous factor set in `H²(G, M)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.FactorSet.IsContCohomologous`: two factor sets whose quotient is a continuous coboundary,
  with `EpsilonEridani.FactorSet.isContCohomologousSetoid` the equivalence relation it cuts out on
  continuous factor sets.
* `EpsilonEridani.FactorSet.contCohomologyClassEquiv`: **`H²(G, M)` classifies continuous factor sets up to
  continuous cohomology.**
* `GroupExtension.contCohomologyClass`: the class of a profinite extension with compact kernel,
  in the root namespace so that it is available as `S.contCohomologyClass`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension.continuousEquivSetoid`: continuous equivalence of bundled
  profinite extensions, the kernel of the class map.
* `EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension.contCohomologyClassEquiv`: **`H²(G, M)` classifies profinite
  extensions of `G` by `M` inducing the given action up to continuous equivalence**, as a
  bijection of sets.
* `EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension.map`: the pushforward of a profinite extension along a
  continuous equivariant homomorphism of profinite coefficient modules.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.FactorSet.contCohomologyClass_eq_iff` and
  `EpsilonEridani.FactorSet.exists_contCohomologyClass_eq`: the class is a complete invariant modulo
  continuous coboundaries, and it takes every value.
* `EpsilonEridani.GroupExtension.contCohomologyClass_factorSet_eq`: the class of the factor set of a
  continuous normalized section does not depend on the section.
* `GroupExtension.exists_equiv_continuous_iff_contCohomologyClass_eq`: **`H²(G, M)` classifies
  profinite extensions of `G` by `M` inducing the given action, up to continuous equivalence.**
* `GroupExtension.exists_splitting_continuous_iff_contCohomologyClass_eq_zero`: **a profinite
  extension has a continuous homomorphic section exactly when its class vanishes.**
* `EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension.exists_contCohomologyClass_eq`: for profinite `G` and `M`,
  every class of `H²(G, M)` is the class of a profinite extension.
* `EpsilonEridani.FactorSet.contCohomologyClass_map` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ProfiniteGroupExtension.contCohomologyClassEquiv_map`: **the classification is natural
  in the coefficient module**: the class of a pushforward is the image of the class under the
  coefficient map.
