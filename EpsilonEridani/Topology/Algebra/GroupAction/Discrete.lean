# Continuous actions on discrete spaces

This file develops openness properties of continuous group actions on discrete spaces.
For a finite space, the kernel of the action is open and the action factors through a finite
quotient. For an arbitrary discrete space acted on by a compact topological group, every finite
set is fixed pointwise by an open normal subgroup. In particular, each orbit map factors through
a finite quotient. Total disconnectedness of the acting group is not needed: point stabilizers
are clopen, so Mathlib's compact-group clopen-neighborhood theorem applies directly.

For actions on discrete additive groups, the fixed-point subgroups over all open normal
subgroups exhaust the group; the additive group need not be commutative. These results supply
the openness and exhaustion properties used by the finite-quotient system for continuous
cohomology.

Mathlib supplies open point stabilizers, open normal subgroups inside clopen neighborhoods of
the identity in compact groups, and the quotient action on fixed points of a normal subgroup.
We use its fixed-point objects throughout.
