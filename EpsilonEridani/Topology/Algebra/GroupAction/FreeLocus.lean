# The free locus of a properly discontinuous group action

For a group acting on a space, the free locus consists of the points with trivial stabilizer.
It is naturally an invariant subspace. If the action is properly discontinuous on a locally
compact Hausdorff space, this subspace is open: a sufficiently small neighbourhood of a free
point meets none of its nontrivial translates.

On the free locus, the orbit projection is a quotient covering map. In particular it is both a
covering map and a local homeomorphism. This separates the unramified part of a quotient from
points with nontrivial stabilizer, where the full orbit projection need not be a covering map.
The free locus is locally compact and the action on it is free and properly discontinuous, so
the generic constructions for free properly discontinuous quotients apply to it by instance
search.
