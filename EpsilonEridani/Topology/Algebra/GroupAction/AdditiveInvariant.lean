# Additive invariants of finite discrete group actions

Fix a natural number `p` and a group `G` with a topology. Consider finite discrete additive
commutative groups with a continuous distributive `G`-action whose elements are killed by a power
of `p`. An integer-valued invariant additive on every equivariant short exact sequence vanishes
on subsingleton objects and is preserved by equivariant additive equivalences.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.invariant_eq_zero_of_subsingleton`: an additive invariant vanishes on a subsingleton
  object.
* `EpsilonEridani.invariant_eq_of_equiv`: an additive invariant is constant on equivariant additive
  equivalence classes.
