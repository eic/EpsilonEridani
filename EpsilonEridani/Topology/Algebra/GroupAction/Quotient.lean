# Continuous maps from group quotients

This file records continuity results for maps out of group quotients that do not require
transitivity of an action.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.continuous_ofQuotientStabilizer` proves continuity of the orbit map descended to a
  stabilizer quotient when the corresponding orbit map is continuous.
