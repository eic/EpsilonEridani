# Topological orbit-stabilizer for transitive actions

For a transitive action on a Hausdorff space `X`, if the orbit map at `b` is continuous and the
quotient by the stabilizer is compact, then the orbit-stabilizer equivalence is a homeomorphism

`G ⧸ MulAction.stabilizer G b ≃ₜ X`.

Continuity descends from the orbit map `g ↦ g • b` through the quotient topology. The quotient
is compact, so its continuous bijection with the Hausdorff space `X` has continuous inverse.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.continuous_quotientStabilizerEquiv` proves continuity of the algebraic
  orbit-stabilizer equivalence.
* `EpsilonEridani.quotientStabilizerHomeomorph` is its canonical topological upgrade for compact quotient
  and Hausdorff `X`.
* `EpsilonEridani.quotientStabilizerHomeomorph_toEquiv` identifies its underlying equivalence with the
  algebraic orbit-stabilizer equivalence.
* `EpsilonEridani.quotientStabilizerHomeomorph_mk` and
  `EpsilonEridani.quotientStabilizerHomeomorph_smul` record its representative and equivariance laws.
