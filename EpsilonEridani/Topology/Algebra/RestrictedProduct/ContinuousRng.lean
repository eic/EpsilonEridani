# Continuity of maps into a restricted product

The topology of a restricted product `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]` is the final topology over its principal
stages `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 T]`, `T` cofinite, and is in general strictly finer than the topology
induced from the full product `Π i, R i`. Continuity of a map *into* a restricted product therefore
does not follow from continuity of its coordinates. This file records two criteria that do apply:
the first when the map is controlled by a single stage, the second by applying the first stagewise
through the universal property of the restricted product.

* `continuous_restrictedProduct_iff_of_forall_mem`: a map whose values all lie in one principal
  stage of the filter is continuous exactly when it is continuous into the full product.
* `continuous_restrictedProduct_of_apply_eq_of_isOpen`: for a finite set `S` of indices, a map
  recombining an arbitrary family of coordinates on `S` with a restricted-product element away
  from `S` is continuous, provided the reference sets away from `S` are open. Its domain is a
  product with a restricted-product factor, so the openness hypothesis is that of Mathlib's
  universal property with parameters, `RestrictedProduct.continuous_dom_prod_left`, and it is
  asked only at the indices carrying a reference set. This is the topological input for the
  inverse of the decomposition of a restricted product into the plain product over a finite set
  of indices times the restricted product away from it. The openness hypothesis cannot be
  dropped: see `not_continuous_restrictedProduct_of_apply_eq_rat_bot`.

/-- For a finite set `S` of indices, a map that recombines a family of coordinates on `S` with a
restricted-product element away from `S` into an element of the full restricted product is
continuous when the reference sets away from `S` are open. The map is pinned by its two coordinate
formulas: on `S` it returns the given coordinate, and away from `S` it returns the coordinate of
the given restricted-product element. -/
