# Diagonal homomorphisms into restricted products

A family of homomorphisms `φ i : Γ →* G i` whose values at each `γ` lie in the reference
subgroup `U i` for all but finitely many `i` assembles into a homomorphism from `Γ` into the
restricted product `Πʳ i, [G i, U i]`, the *diagonal*. The eventual-integrality evidence is an
argument of the construction: for the classical example `Γ = G(K)` and `G i = G(K_v)` it is an
arithmetic theorem about `Γ`, and nothing here manufactures it.

This file records the diagonal, its coordinate formula, its kernel and the resulting injectivity
criterion, its compatibility with componentwise maps, with a change of factors and with a
change of reference family, and the continuity criterion. Continuity does not follow from
continuity of the coordinate maps, because the restricted-product topology is finer than the
topology induced from `Π i, G i`. The criterion asks for one cofinite set `S` of indices at which
every `γ` is integral. Such a uniform set is what the restricted-product topology rewards: on the
subset `{x | ∀ i ∈ S, x i ∈ U i}`, which then contains the image of the diagonal, it coincides
with the topology induced from `Π i, G i`, so continuity there is decided by the coordinates.

The uniform integrality set cannot be dispensed with. For discrete groups with trivial reference
subgroups, infinitely many of them nontrivial, take for `Γ` the finitely supported elements of the
full product, topologised as a subspace of it. Its coordinate maps are continuous and each of its
elements is eventually integral, yet the diagonal into the restricted product, which is discrete,
is not continuous (`continuous_eval_and_not_continuous_rationalDiagonal_range_coeMonoidHom`).

The general statements have additive counterparts: `addRationalDiagonal` is the diagonal of a
family of additive homomorphisms `Γ →+ G i`, with coordinate formula `addRationalDiagonal_apply`.
