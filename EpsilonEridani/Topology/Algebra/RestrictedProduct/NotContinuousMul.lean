# Restricted products with non-open reference subgroups

Mathlib makes a restricted product of topological groups a topological group only when every
reference subgroup is open (`RestrictedProduct.isTopologicalGroup`, under
`Fact (∀ i, IsOpen (A i))`). This file shows that the hypothesis cannot be dropped: the restricted
product `Πʳ n : ℕ, [Multiplicative ℚ, ⊥]` of copies of `ℚ`, with the topology of `ℚ ⊆ ℝ` and the
trivial reference subgroup in every factor, does not have continuous multiplication. Additively it
is the space of finitely supported rational sequences with the final topology over the
finite-dimensional stages, and a final topology need not be compatible with products. That a strict
inductive limit of topological groups need not be a topological group in the inductive-limit
topology is classical; see Tatsuuma, Shimomura and Hirai.

The witness is the set `W = {x | ∀ n ≥ 1, |x n| < |x 0 - √2 / (n + 1)|}`, written additively. It is
open, because on each stage only finitely many coordinates are free and the right-hand sides never
vanish at a rational `x 0`, and it contains `0`. But every neighbourhood of `0` contains `t • e₀`
for all rational `t` of small absolute value and `s • eₙ` for all rational `s` of small absolute
value, and for `n` large and `t` rational close to `√2 / (n + 1)` the sum `t • e₀ + s • eₙ`
escapes `W`.

Multiplication on this space factors through the inverse of the splitting `restrictedProductSum` of
the restricted product over `ℕ ⊕ ℕ` into two restricted products, followed by the coordinatewise
product of the two halves, which is continuous for every family. So that inverse is not continuous
for this family either (`not_continuous_restrictedProductSum_symm`), although
`continuous_restrictedProductSum_symm` makes it continuous once the reference subgroups are open;
openness is a fact about the topology, not a limitation of that proof.

The same set `W` shows that recombining a coordinate at `0` with an element of the restricted
product over the indices `n ≠ 0` is not continuous
(`not_continuous_restrictedProduct_of_apply_eq_rat_bot`): here the open neighbourhoods of `0` come
from the plain product over `{0}` and from the restricted product away from `0`, and the same
choice of `t` and `s` escapes `W`. The inverse of the decomposition `awayDecomposition` of a
restricted product into the product over a finite set of indices times the restricted product
away from it is such a map, so it is not continuous when the reference subgroups away from that
set are not open (`not_continuous_awayDecomposition_symm`); compare
`continuous_awayDecomposition_symm` and `continuous_restrictedProduct_of_apply_eq_of_isOpen`.

The openness of the witness is checked stage by stage with `isOpen_restrictedProduct_iff`, and the
neighbourhood argument uses `continuous_restrictedProduct_mulSingle`.
