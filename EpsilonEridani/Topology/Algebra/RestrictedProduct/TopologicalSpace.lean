# The topology of a restricted product

General facts about the restricted-product topology, which Mathlib defines as the final
topology over the principal stages `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 S]`. A set is open if and only if its
preimage in every principal stage is open: this is the `Prop`-valued form of Mathlib's universal
property `RestrictedProduct.continuous_dom`. Inserting a single factor is continuous, the analogue
of `continuous_mulSingle` for `Pi` types.

The restricted-product topology is finer than the topology induced from the full product
`Π i, R i`, and in general strictly finer. The clearest instance is a family of discrete spaces
with reference sets of at most one element: every principal stage indexed by a cofinite set, and
hence the restricted product itself, is discrete (`discreteTopology_restrictedProduct`), whereas
the full product of discrete groups with infinitely many nontrivial factors is not. So for
discrete groups with trivial reference subgroups, infinitely many of them nontrivial, the coercion
to the full product is not inducing (`not_isInducing_coe_bot`): the restricted-product topology is
not the induced one. This is the reason continuity of a map *into* a restricted product does not
follow from continuity of its coordinates.

strictly finer than the induced one in general, and continuity of a map into a restricted product
does not follow from continuity of its coordinates. -/
