# Countable generation of `𝓝 0` passes to the separated completion

The zero-point form of `UniformSpace.Completion.isCountablyGenerated_nhds_coe`, registered as an
instance. Only a zero and a uniformity are needed; no group structure, no separation, no
completeness.

It exists because results in the Huber development carry `[(𝓝 (0 : A)).IsCountablyGenerated]` and
are applied with `A` a completion — in particular to `A⟨X₁,…,Xₖ⟩`, the completion of the
restricted-series subring, where
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.isCountablyGenerated_nhds_zero_weightedRestrictedSubring` supplies the property
downstairs and this carries it up.

## Main results

* `UniformSpace.Completion.isCountablyGenerated_nhds_zero`.
