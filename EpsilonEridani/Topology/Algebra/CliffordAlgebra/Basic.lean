# Topology on Clifford algebras

This file gives a Clifford algebra its module topology, making it a topological additive group.
Over a topological ring, multiplication is continuous when the Clifford algebra is a finite module.
The topology is Hausdorff when the base ring is Hausdorff with continuous addition and
multiplication, and the Clifford algebra is free. Clifford reverse, involution, and star are
continuous without these additional assumptions.

The topology is intrinsic: it depends only on the module structure of the Clifford algebra
together with the topology on the base ring, and does not use a basis, Pin or Spin groups, or their
actions. A basis appears only in the proof that the topology is Hausdorff.

## Main results

* `CliffordAlgebra.instTopologicalSpaceCliffordAlgebra` installs the module topology.
* `CliffordAlgebra.instIsTopologicalAddGroupCliffordAlgebra` makes addition continuous.
* `CliffordAlgebra.continuous_ι` proves continuity of the canonical generator when the vector
  module has its module topology.
* `CliffordAlgebra.continuous_ιInv` proves continuity of the vector-part map under the same
  topology assumption when `2` is invertible.
* `QuadraticMap.Isometry.continuous_cliffordAlgebraMap` proves continuity of maps induced by
  quadratic isometries.
* `CliffordAlgebra.instIsTopologicalRingCliffordAlgebra` makes multiplication continuous.
* `CliffordAlgebra.instT2SpaceCliffordAlgebra` proves the topology is Hausdorff.
* `CliffordAlgebra.continuous_reverse` and `CliffordAlgebra.continuous_involute` prove continuity
  of the two canonical Clifford involutions.
* `CliffordAlgebra.instContinuousStarCliffordAlgebra` packages continuity of Clifford star.
