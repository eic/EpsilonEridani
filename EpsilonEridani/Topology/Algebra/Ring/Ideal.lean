# The quotient of a topological ring by an ideal

Two things about `R ⧸ I` that its algebraic theory does not record. It is `T1` exactly when `I` is
closed, and hence `T0`; and when `f : R →+* S` presents `S` as a topological quotient of `R`, the
first isomorphism theorem `R ⧸ ker f ≃+* S` is a homeomorphism, so `S` carries the quotient
topology and not merely a coarser one.

Mathlib proves the corresponding statement for the quotient of a topological group by a
subgroup, as `QuotientGroup.t1Space_iff` and `QuotientGroup.instT1Space`. Those are stated for
`G ⧸ N` with `N : AddSubgroup G` in the additive case, whereas `R ⧸ I` is the quotient by an
`Ideal`. The two quotients are definitionally equal — Mathlib's own
`Ideal.topologicalRing_quotient` builds the additive structure of `R ⧸ I` out of
`QuotientAddGroup.instIsTopologicalAddGroup` — but reaching the group statement from an ideal
still means presenting `I` as `I.toAddSubgroup` and transporting the closedness hypothesis along
that presentation, which unification does not do on its own: with only `IsClosed (I : Set R)` in
context, `T1Space (R ⧸ I)` is not synthesized. So the results below are that transport, and
their proofs delegate to Mathlib rather than reproving anything.

Only separate continuity of addition is needed for the separation results, matching the hypotheses
of the group statements they delegate to; no ring topology and no multiplicative continuity is
used. The first isomorphism theorem below asks for even less: only that `R ⧸ ker f` carries the
coinduced topology, which it does by construction.

## The topological first isomorphism theorem

Algebraically, `RingHom.quotientKerEquivOfSurjective` identifies `R ⧸ ker f` with `S` for any
surjective `f`. Topologically that says nothing: `R ⧸ ker f` carries the quotient topology, and a
continuous surjection can land on a strictly coarser topology than the quotient one, so the
bijection is continuous but need not be open. What closes the gap is exactly the hypothesis that
`f` is a *quotient map*, and with it the algebraic isomorphism becomes a homeomorphism.

Over a Tate ring the quotient-map hypothesis is `EpsilonEridani.Huber.IsTateRing.isQuotientMap`, an open
mapping theorem.

Note that closedness of `ker f` comes for free once `S` is `T1`, since a kernel is the preimage of
a point; it is not a further hypothesis of the theorem but a consequence for its consumers, and
`Ideal.Quotient.instT1Space` above then hands back the separation of `R ⧸ ker f`.

## Main results

* `Ideal.Quotient.t1Space_iff`: `T1Space (R ⧸ I) ↔ IsClosed (I : Set R)`.
* `Ideal.Quotient.instT1Space`: the instance form, so that `T0Space (R ⧸ I)` is found
  automatically once `I` is known to be closed.
* `Ideal.Quotient.continuous_lift`: a continuous ring homomorphism annihilating `I` induces a
  *continuous* homomorphism on `R ⧸ I`, with no hypothesis on `I`.
* `RingHom.isHomeomorph_kerLift`: the map `R ⧸ ker f →+* S` induced by `f` is a homeomorphism when
  `f` is a quotient map. `IsHomeomorph.homeomorph` bundles that as
  `R ⧸ ker f ≃ₜ S`, and the map bundled is the ring homomorphism `RingHom.kerLift`, so the ring
  structure comes along with it and needs no transport of its own.

namespace RingHom

/-- **The topological first isomorphism theorem for rings.** A ring homomorphism that is a
quotient map presents its target as the quotient of its source by its kernel, topologically as
well as algebraically.

A continuous surjection is not enough on its own. Surjectivity of `f` makes the lift bijective and
continuity of `f` makes it continuous, but a continuous bijection is open only when the topology it
lands in is no coarser than the one it carries; that `f` is a quotient map is exactly the statement
that it is not coarser.

`IsHomeomorph.homeomorph` turns this into `R ⧸ ker f ≃ₜ S`. What it bundles is `RingHom.kerLift`,
which is a ring homomorphism, so a consumer needing the isomorphism of rings has it already —
`RingHom.quotientKerEquivOfSurjective` is that same map. -/
