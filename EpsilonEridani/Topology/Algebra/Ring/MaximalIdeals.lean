# Ideals of a topological ring with open unit group

Openness of the unit group makes the closure of a proper ideal proper again: the units are open, so
their complement is a closed set containing the ideal, hence containing its closure. For a maximal
ideal `𝔪` that closure is an ideal squeezed between `𝔪` and the unit ideal, so it is `𝔪` itself and
`𝔪` is closed.

Openness of the unit group is the only topological input, and it stays a hypothesis so that any
route to it can consume this lemma. `EpsilonEridani.RingTheory.Huber.UnitGroup` supplies one for complete
Huber rings and reads Wedhorn's Proposition 7.51 off it, but nothing here mentions completeness, a
nonarchimedean topology, or commutativity: `Ideal A` is the lattice of left ideals of a ring `A`,
and a proper left ideal already avoids the units.

Contrast `EpsilonEridani.Topology.Algebra.Nonarchimedean.MaximalIdeals`, which proves maximal ideals
*open*. That argument needs a linear topology and is vacuous for a Tate ring, where no proper ideal
is open; closedness is the form that survives.

## Main results

* `Ideal.closure_ne_top_of_isOpen_isUnit` : the closure of a proper ideal of a topological ring is
  again proper once the unit group is open.
* `Ideal.isClosed_of_isMaximal_of_isOpen_isUnit` : a maximal ideal of a topological ring is closed
  once the unit group is open.

## Provenance

Adapted from AINTLIB (see References), section `MaximalIdealClosed` of the source file, where the
statement is `isClosed_of_isMaximal_of_isOpen_units`. The argument is that file's; the
commutativity hypothesis is dropped, and the properness step, which uses nothing about maximality,
is separated out as `Ideal.closure_ne_top_of_isOpen_isUnit`.
