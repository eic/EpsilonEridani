# Continuous finite quotients of a topological group

A finite group `Q` **occurs as a continuous finite quotient** of a topological group `G`, written
`IsFiniteContinuousQuotient G Q`, when `Q` is finite and some surjective homomorphism `G →* Q` has
open kernel. The predicate is phrased through the kernel and not through a topology on `Q`: when
`G` is a topological group (`IsTopologicalGroup G`), a homomorphism into a finite discrete group is
continuous exactly when its kernel is open (`MonoidHom.continuous_iff_isOpen_ker`), so nothing is
lost, and the predicate is manifestly invariant under isomorphism of `Q`. The continuous finite
quotients of `G` are, up to isomorphism, the quotients `G ⧸ U` by its open normal subgroups of
finite index; when `G` is compact with separately continuous multiplication (in particular a
compact topological group) every open subgroup has finite index, so they are the quotients by all
open normal subgroups.

The finite-quotient determinacy of topologically finitely generated profinite groups, the main
consumer of this predicate, is in `EpsilonEridani.Topology.Algebra.Group.Profinite.FiniteQuotients`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteContinuousQuotient`: `Q` occurs as a continuous finite quotient of `G`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isFiniteContinuousQuotient_iff_exists_openNormalSubgroup`: the continuous finite
  quotients of `G` are the quotients by its open normal subgroups of finite index, up to
  isomorphism.
* `EpsilonEridani.isFiniteContinuousQuotient_iff_exists_continuous`: for a finite discrete `Q` and a
  topological group `G`, the predicate is the existence of a continuous surjection `G →* Q`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isFiniteContinuousQuotient_congr_left`,
  `EpsilonEridani.isFiniteContinuousQuotient_congr_right`: the predicate depends only on the topological
  isomorphism class of `G` and on the isomorphism class of `Q`.

/-- `Q` **occurs as a continuous finite quotient** of the topological group `G`: `Q` is finite and
some surjective homomorphism `G →* Q` has open kernel. The group `Q` carries no topology; when `G`
is a topological group (`IsTopologicalGroup G`) and `Q` carries the discrete topology, an open
kernel is the same as continuity (`isFiniteContinuousQuotient_iff_exists_continuous`). Finiteness
is part of the predicate because an open kernel alone does not force it: a discrete group is a
quotient of itself with open kernel. When `G` is compact with separately continuous multiplication
(in particular a compact topological group) every open subgroup has finite index, so there
finiteness is automatic (`OpenNormalSubgroup.isFiniteContinuousQuotient`). -/
