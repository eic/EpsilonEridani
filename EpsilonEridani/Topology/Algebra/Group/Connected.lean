# Connectedness of topological groups

This file derives connectedness of a group from preconnectedness of a subgroup and its coset
quotient.

## Main result

* `Subgroup.connectedSpace_of_quotient`: a group with continuous left translations is
  connected when a subgroup and the corresponding coset quotient are preconnected.
