# The standard dyadic Demushkin presentation `D₀ = ⟨A, S, Y ∣ A²S⁴(S,Y)⟩`

This file defines the pro-`2` group `D₀`, presented on three generators `A, S, Y` by the single
relator `A²S⁴(S,Y)`, where `(x, y) = x⁻¹y⁻¹xy` is Labute's commutator convention. In Labute's
classification of Demushkin groups with `q = 2` and odd rank, `D₀` is the normal form of rank
`3` with `f = 2`; it is the abstract group that the local theory identifies with the maximal
pro-`2` quotient of the absolute Galois group of `ℚ₂`. The name `D₀`, the marked generators
`A, S, Y` and the relator `A²S⁴[S,Y]` follow Roe–Turturean, §3.1, equation (3.1), whose commutator
convention is the same. Neither that identification nor the Demushkin property itself is
established here.

What is established is that the presentation is not vacuous. The map on the free pro-`2` group
sending `A ↦ 0`, `S ↦ 1`, `Y ↦ 0` in `ℤ/2` kills the relator, because the commutator dies in
an abelian group and `2 · 0 + 4 · 1 = 0`, so it descends to a continuous surjection
`D₀ ↠ ℤ/2`. Hence `D₀` is nontrivial: the marked generator `S` is not the identity. The
marked generators topologically generate `D₀`, so `D₀` is topologically finitely generated, and a
continuous homomorphism out of `D₀` is determined by its values on `A`, `S` and `Y`.

The presentation is moreover minimal: the relator is a product of two squares and a commutator,
so it lies in the Frattini subgroup of the free pro-`2` group on three generators, and therefore
`D₀` has topological generator rank exactly `3`. This is the rank `n = 3` of the Demushkin
invariants of `D₀`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.d0Relator`: the relator `A²S⁴(S,Y)` in the free pro-`2` group on `Fin 3`.
* `EpsilonEridani.demushkinD0`: the presented pro-`2` group `D₀`.
* `EpsilonEridani.d0A`, `EpsilonEridani.d0S`, `EpsilonEridani.d0Y`: its marked generators.
* `EpsilonEridani.d0Lift`: the continuous homomorphism `D₀ → P` determined by three elements of a pro-`2`
  group `P` satisfying the relation `a²s⁴(s,y) = 1`.
* `EpsilonEridani.d0FreeCharacter`: the character `A ↦ 0`, `S ↦ 1`, `Y ↦ 0` of the free pro-`2` group.
* `EpsilonEridani.d0Character`: the induced character `D₀ → ℤ/2`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.d0_relation`: the marked generators satisfy `A²S⁴(S,Y) = 1`.
* `EpsilonEridani.d0_hom_ext`: a continuous homomorphism out of `D₀` is determined by its values on
  `A`, `S` and `Y`.
* `EpsilonEridani.d0FreeCharacter_d0Relator`: the character kills the relator.
* `EpsilonEridani.d0Character_surjective`: the induced character `D₀ → ℤ/2` is surjective.
* `EpsilonEridani.d0S_ne_one` and the `Nontrivial demushkinD0` instance: `D₀` is nontrivial.
* `EpsilonEridani.d0_topologicallyGenerates`: `A`, `S`, `Y` topologically generate `D₀`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated_demushkinD0`: `D₀` is topologically finitely
  generated.
* `EpsilonEridani.d0Relator_mem_proPFrattini`: the relator lies in the Frattini subgroup of the free
  pro-`2` group, so the presentation of `D₀` is minimal.
* `EpsilonEridani.topologicalGeneratorRankNat_demushkinD0`: `D₀` has topological generator rank `3`.
