# Products of pro-p groups

The class of pro-`p` groups is stable under products: if each factor is pro-`p`, then so is
their product with the product topology. Together with stability under continuous surjective
images from `ProP.Basic`, this is part of the basic closure API for `IsProP`, and lets new pro-`p`
groups be assembled from known factors without re-examining their open normal subgroups. The
result is stated both for binary products `G × H` and for indexed products `∀ i, G i`, the two
product forms used in practice.

The index type of `IsProP.pi` is arbitrary, so the closure covers infinite products as well as
finite ones. That generality is what makes it applicable to inverse limits, which are carved out
of a product over an index category that need not be finite.

## Main results

* `IsProP.prod`: a product of two pro-`p` groups is pro-`p`.
* `IsProP.pi`: a product of pro-`p` groups is pro-`p`.
