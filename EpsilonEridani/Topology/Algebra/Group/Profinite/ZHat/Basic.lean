# The profinite integers as a profinite group

The **profinite integers** `ℤ̂`, written `zHat`, form the profinite completion of the additive
group of `ℤ`, written multiplicatively. This file records the group-theoretic facts about `ℤ̂`
that the pro-`p` theory uses; the ring structure on `ℤ̂` is not treated here.

The generator `1 ∈ ℤ` gives the topological generator `zHat.gen`, and the universal property of
the profinite completion becomes: continuous homomorphisms from `ℤ̂` to a profinite group `P`
are exactly the elements of `P`, through the value at `zHat.gen`. Since the image of `ℤ` is
dense, `ℤ̂` is commutative. The identification of the maximal pro-`p` quotient of `ℤ̂` with the
`p`-adic integers, and of its `p`-Sylow subgroups with `ℤ_p`, is in
`EpsilonEridani.Topology.Algebra.Group.Profinite.ZHat.PadicInt`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.zHat`: the profinite integers, as a profinite group.
* `EpsilonEridani.zHat.ofInt`, `EpsilonEridani.zHat.gen`: the canonical homomorphism from `ℤ` and the image
  of `1`.
* `EpsilonEridani.zHat.lift`: the continuous homomorphism to a profinite group sending `zHat.gen` to a
  given element.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.zHat.hom_ext`, `EpsilonEridani.zHat.existsUnique_lift`: the universal property of `ℤ̂`.
* `EpsilonEridani.zHat.denseRange_ofInt`, and the `IsMulCommutative zHat` instance: the image of `ℤ`
  is dense, so `ℤ̂` is commutative.
