# Images of Sylow pro-`p` subgroups under continuous surjections

A continuous surjective group homomorphism from a compact source onto a Hausdorff target carries
a Sylow pro-`p` subgroup onto a Sylow pro-`p` subgroup. For each open normal subgroup of the
target, pull it back to the source. The induced map between the two quotients is surjective, so
the index of the image divides the original prime-to-`p` index. Compactness of the source and
separation of the target enter only to see that the image is closed: it is a continuous image of
a closed, hence compact, set.

This is the profinite counterpart of the finite-group fact that a surjective homomorphism carries
a Sylow subgroup onto a Sylow subgroup. Unlike invariance under a topological isomorphism, proved
in `EpsilonEridani.Topology.Algebra.Group.Profinite.Sylow.Basic`, it must account for the kernel of the
homomorphism.

## Main result

* `EpsilonEridani.IsProPSylow.map_of_surjective`: the image of a Sylow pro-`p` subgroup under a
  continuous surjective homomorphism with compact source and Hausdorff target is Sylow pro-`p`.
