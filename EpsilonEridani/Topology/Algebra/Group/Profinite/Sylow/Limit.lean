# Sylow pro-`p` subgroups as inverse limits of Sylow subgroups

A Sylow pro-`p` subgroup of a profinite group is the same thing as a compatible choice of Sylow
`p`-subgroup in each of its finite quotients. Such a choice is a `SylowFamily`, a point of the
inverse limit of the finite sets `Sylow p (G ⧸ U)`, and `SylowFamily.equivIsProPSylow` is the
bijection between those points and the Sylow pro-`p` subgroups of `G`.

One direction is `isProPSylow_limitSubgroup`: a compatible family cuts out a Sylow pro-`p`
subgroup. For the other, a Sylow pro-`p` subgroup `P` has a Sylow image `IsProPSylow.toSylow` in
each `G ⧸ U`; those images are compatible along the quotient maps, and `P` is closed, so `P` is
cut out by them. Since a profinite group is the inverse limit of its finite quotients, this says
that the Sylow pro-`p` subgroups of that inverse limit are the inverse limit of the sets of Sylow
subgroups of its levels; existence of a Sylow pro-`p` subgroup (`exists_isProPSylow`) is then
nonemptiness of that inverse limit.

## Main definitions and results

* `SylowFamily`: a compatible family of Sylow `p`-subgroups of the finite quotients, and
  `SylowFamily.subgroup`, the subgroup of `G` it cuts out.
* `IsProPSylow.map_mapOfLE_toSylow`: the finite-quotient images of a Sylow pro-`p` subgroup are
  compatible along the quotient maps.
* `IsProPSylow.limitSubgroup_toSylow`: a Sylow pro-`p` subgroup is cut out by its finite-quotient
  images.
* `SylowFamily.equivIsProPSylow`: the compatible families correspond to the Sylow pro-`p`
  subgroups.
