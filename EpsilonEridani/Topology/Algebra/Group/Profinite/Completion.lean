# The universal property of profinite completion

This file restates the categorical universal property of Mathlib's profinite completion for
unbundled groups and continuous monoid homomorphisms. It also proves that the canonical map from
a finite group to its profinite completion is bijective, and exposes the projections of the
profinite completion onto the finite quotients it is the limit of.

The correspondence is obtained from `ProfiniteGrp.ProfiniteCompletion.homEquiv`; the finite-group
result uses its canonical map's dense range and Mathlib's residual-finiteness criterion. The
projections are the components of Mathlib's explicit limit cone.

The continuous finite quotients of the completion are exactly the finite quotients of `G`
(`isFiniteContinuousQuotient_iff_exists_surjective`), and the completion of a finitely generated
group is topologically finitely generated (`isTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated`). Through the
finite-quotient determinacy of topologically finitely generated profinite groups this gives the
theorem of Dixon, Formanek, Poland and Ribes: two finitely generated groups with the same finite
quotients have topologically isomorphic profinite completions
(`nonempty_continuousMulEquiv_of_forall_exists_surjective_iff`); in fact finite generation of one
of the two groups suffices.
