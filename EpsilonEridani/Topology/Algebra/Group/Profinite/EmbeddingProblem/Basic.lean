# Finite embedding problems

A **finite embedding problem** for a topological group `G` is a continuous surjection
`π : G ↠ Q` onto a finite group together with a surjection `α : E ↠ Q` of finite groups. A
**solution** is a continuous homomorphism `β : G → E` with `α ∘ β = π`. For homomorphisms into
finite discrete groups, continuity is recorded as openness of the kernel. This equivalence uses
the topological group structure on `G`.

A solution need not be surjective. For example, if `G` is cyclic of order `p`, `Q = 1`, and
`E = G × G`, no homomorphism `G → E` is surjective.

A surjection `φ : E ↠ F` of finite groups and a homomorphism `β : G → F` with open kernel cut out
an embedding problem, `EpsilonEridani.FiniteEmbeddingProblem.ofSurjective`: the quotient is the range of
`β` and the group to map into is its preimage under `φ`. Its solutions are exactly the lifts of `β`
through `φ` with open kernel, and its kernel is the kernel of `φ`. This is the problem that
appears when a solution modulo a normal subgroup is lifted one step further, and at each finite
level of a lifting problem against a surjection of profinite groups.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.FiniteEmbeddingProblem`: a finite embedding problem for `G`.
* `EpsilonEridani.FiniteEmbeddingProblem.IsSolution`: a solution of a finite embedding problem.
* `EpsilonEridani.FiniteEmbeddingProblem.ofSurjective`: the embedding problem cut out by a surjection
  `φ : E ↠ F` of finite groups and a homomorphism `β : G → F` with open kernel.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.FiniteEmbeddingProblem.ker_ofSurjective_α`: the kernel of the problem cut out by `φ`
  and `β` is the kernel of `φ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.FiniteEmbeddingProblem.isSolution_ofSurjective_iff`: its solutions are the lifts of
  `β` through `φ` with open kernel.
