# Solvability with elementary abelian kernel

`EpsilonEridani.HasElementaryAbelianSolutions p G` says that every finite embedding problem for `G`
with commutative kernel killed by `p` has a solution. For prime `p` such a kernel is exactly an
elementary abelian `p`-group, whence the name; for composite `p` the condition is weaker. The
finite groups are taken in the universe of `G`, as every finite group is isomorphic to one in that
universe.

/-- **Solvability with elementary abelian kernel.** Every finite embedding problem for `G`, with
groups in the universe of `G`, whose kernel `ker α` is commutative and killed by `p`, has a
solution. For prime `p` these kernels are the elementary abelian `p`-groups. -/
