# The free pro-`p` group on no generators

The free pro-`p` group on an empty type is trivial. Its universal property makes every
continuous endomorphism equal: two such maps agree on the empty set of generators. In
particular it is topologically isomorphic to the one-element group.

This is the zero-generator case of the free pro-`p` construction used in finite-rank
presentations. The argument works for any empty type and does not require `p` to be prime.
