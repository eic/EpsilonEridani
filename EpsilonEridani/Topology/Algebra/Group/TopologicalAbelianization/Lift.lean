# The universal property of the topological abelianization

The topological abelianization `G ⧸ closure [G, G]` of a topological group `G` is the universal
continuous homomorphism from `G` to a commutative `T1` topological group: such a homomorphism
kills every commutator, so its closed kernel contains the closure of the commutator subgroup, and
it factors uniquely through the quotient. This is the topological counterpart of
`Abelianization.lift`; it is what identifies the abelianization of a concrete profinite group with
an abelian profinite group given by its universal property.

## Main definitions

* `TopologicalAbelianization.lift`: the continuous homomorphism
  `TopologicalAbelianization G →ₜ* A` induced by a continuous homomorphism `G →ₜ* A` into a
  commutative `T1` group.

## Main results

* `TopologicalAbelianization.topologicalClosure_commutator_le_ker`: the closure of the
  commutator subgroup lies in the kernel of every continuous homomorphism to a commutative `T1`
  group.
* `TopologicalAbelianization.lift_mk`, `TopologicalAbelianization.lift_unique`:
  the factorisation and its uniqueness.
* `TopologicalAbelianization.hom_ext`: a continuous homomorphism out of the topological
  abelianization is determined by its values on the classes of elements of `G`.
