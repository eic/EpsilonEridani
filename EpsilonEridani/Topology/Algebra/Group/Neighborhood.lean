# Subgroup neighbourhoods under translation

An identity-neighbourhood description of a subgroup transports to every point of the subgroup by
left multiplication. The result is stated for an arbitrary local parametrisation, so it can be
used both for exponential charts and for later subgroup atlases.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.eventually_mem_iff_exists_mul_eq_of_mem` transports an eventual identity-neighbourhood
  characterisation `f y = x` to the translated form `g * f y = x` near `g ∈ K`.
* `AddSubgroup.eventually_mem_iff_exists_add_eq_of_mem` is the additive counterpart.

The only regularity required is continuity of the constant action: inversion is used algebraically
to identify the translated neighbourhood, while Mathlib's action homeomorphism
`Homeomorph.smul` (and its additive `Homeomorph.vadd` analogue) supplies the topological transport.
