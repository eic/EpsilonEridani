# Continuity of the transversal word

For a subgroup `U` of a group `G` and a map `t : G ⧸ U → G`, the transversal word
`ℓᵗ_u(γ) = (t u)⁻¹ * γ * t (γ⁻¹ • u)` of `EpsilonEridani.lWord` is a purely group-theoretic construction.
This file adds the one statement about it that needs a topology: if `G` is a topological group and
`U` is *open*, then `γ ↦ ℓᵗ_u(γ)` is continuous (`EpsilonEridani.continuous_lWord`). Of the three factors,
`(t u)⁻¹` is constant and `γ ↦ γ` is the continuous identity; the only one whose continuity is not
immediate is `γ ↦ t (γ⁻¹ • u)`, and openness of `U` makes `G ⧸ U` discrete, so that factor is
locally constant and no continuity is required of `t` itself. The variant
`EpsilonEridani.continuous_lWord_inv_smul` lets the coset index itself be translated by a second group
variable, which is the shape the degree-two corestriction sum is indexed by.

This is the continuity clause of the transversal calculus of the Layer 6 milestone of the
human-authored roadmap at `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ProfiniteCohomology/README.md`. It lives here, rather
than with the calculus in `EpsilonEridani/GroupTheory/TransversalWord.lean`, so that the group theory does
not depend on the topological-group hierarchy.

/-- For an *open* subgroup `U` the transversal word is continuous jointly in its group variable
and in a coset index translated by a second group variable: `(γ, η) ↦ ℓᵗ_{γ⁻¹ • u}(η)`. Here both
`γ ↦ t (γ⁻¹ • u)` and `(γ, η) ↦ t (η⁻¹ • γ⁻¹ • u)` are locally constant, again because `G ⧸ U` is
discrete, so no continuity is required of `t` itself. -/
