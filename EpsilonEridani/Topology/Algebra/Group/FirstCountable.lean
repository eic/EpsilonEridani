# A group with countably generated neighbourhoods of the identity is first countable

`FirstCountableTopology` asks every point's neighbourhood filter to be countably generated. In a
group whose multiplication is separately continuous it is enough to ask it at the identity: left
translation is a homeomorphism, so `𝓝 a` is the image of `𝓝 1` under it, and the image of a
countably generated filter is countably generated.

This matters because countable generation at the identity is what the *proofs* in this area
assume — Henkel's open mapping theorem and
`NonarchimedeanAddGroup.exists_antitone_basis_openAddSubgroup` both state it that way — whereas
`FirstCountableTopology` is the class **Mathlib's own instances are keyed on**. Without the bridge
the two do not meet. For a countable index type `ι`, countable generation of `𝓝 (0 : ι → G)`
is a mathematical *consequence* of countable generation at `0` in `G` — but it does not
**synthesize**: `𝓝` on a `Pi` type is not syntactically a `Filter.pi`, so
`Filter.pi.isCountablyGenerated` never fires on the goal as stated. The obstruction there is
purely one of instance search. With this instance that product, and the subtype and
additive-quotient forms, all resolve.

Countability of the index set is a real hypothesis there and not merely a syntactic one: an
uncountable product of nontrivial groups is not first countable at all, which is why Mathlib's `Pi`
instance carries `[Countable ι]`.

Mathlib's own route into the class for groups runs through the uniformity —
`IsUniformGroup.uniformity_countably_generated` derives `(𝓤 G).IsCountablyGenerated` from
`[(𝓝 (1 : G)).IsCountablyGenerated]`, and `UniformSpace.firstCountableTopology` turns that into
the class. That route is a theorem rather than an instance and needs a `UniformSpace` structure on
`G`; the instance below covers a plain topological group and makes the synthesis automatic.
`Mathlib/Topology/Bases.lean` carries a standing "more fine grained instances for
`FirstCountableTopology`" note where this would sit.

/-- **A group whose identity has countably generated neighbourhoods is first countable.** Left
translation by `a` is a homeomorphism carrying `𝓝 1` to `𝓝 a`, and `Filter.map` preserves
countable generation.

Only the identity is assumed, because that is the form the surrounding theory states — see the
module docstring. Only separate continuity of multiplication is needed: the argument runs through
left translation alone and never uses continuity of inversion. -/
