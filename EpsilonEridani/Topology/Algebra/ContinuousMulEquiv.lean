# Topological isomorphisms between multiplicative type tags of products

The multiplicative type tag of a product of additive topological groups is topologically
isomorphic to the product of the multiplicative type tags, and when `T` has a unique element,
`Multiplicative (M × T)` is topologically isomorphic to `Multiplicative M`. These are
`MulEquiv.prodMultiplicative` and `AddEquiv.prodUnique` between the multiplicative type tags,
upgraded to `ContinuousMulEquiv`s: the first transports properties of topological groups, such as
being pro-`p`, between the two shapes of a product, and the second collapses a product
decomposition of a topological group whose second factor turns out to be trivial.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.ContinuousMulEquiv.prodMultiplicative`: the topological isomorphism
  `Multiplicative (M × N) ≃ₜ* Multiplicative M × Multiplicative N`, with its evaluation lemmas
  `prodMultiplicative_apply` and `prodMultiplicative_symm_apply`.
* `EpsilonEridani.ContinuousMulEquiv.multiplicativeProdUnique`: the topological isomorphism
  `Multiplicative (M × T) ≃ₜ* Multiplicative M` for `[Unique T]`, with its evaluation lemmas
  `multiplicativeProdUnique_apply` and `multiplicativeProdUnique_symm_apply`.
