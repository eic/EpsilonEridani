# A submodule of a topological module is a topological module

A submodule carries the subspace topology. Of the three continuity classes that make that
topology a module topology, Mathlib supplies **one outright** and **one under extra hypotheses**:

* `SMulMemClass.continuousSMul` gives the jointly continuous action `A × ↥p → ↥p` on any `SetLike`
  subobject, with no side conditions beyond the ambient `ContinuousSMul A M`. This file adds
  nothing there.
* `Submodule.topologicalAddGroup` gives `ContinuousAdd ↥p`, but only for a `Ring A` acting on an
  `AddCommGroup M` that is already a topological *group*.

So there are exactly two gaps, and they are what this file fills:

* **`ContinuousAdd` at the generality of its own class** — an `AddCommMonoid` ambient with
  `ContinuousAdd` is outside `Submodule.topologicalAddGroup`'s hypotheses, and
  `AddSubmonoid.continuousAdd`, which is at the right generality, is not keyed on `Submodule`.
* **`ContinuousConstSMul` with no topology on the scalars** — `SMulMemClass.continuousSMul` needs
  a topology on `A` and `ContinuousSMul A M`, whereas
  `EpsilonEridani.Huber.restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodule` asks only for `ContinuousConstSMul A M` with
  `A` untopologised. That is the form this instance is for.

## Main results

* `Submodule.continuousAdd`: addition on `↥p` is continuous, asking only `ContinuousAdd` of the
  ambient module rather than a topological group structure.
* `Submodule.continuousConstSMul`: each scalar acts continuously on `↥p`, with no topology on the
  scalars.

/-- **Addition on a submodule is continuous.** Mathlib has this for an `AddSubmonoid`, and for a
`Submodule` only through `Submodule.topologicalAddGroup`, which needs the ambient module to be a
topological group. A `ContinuousAdd` ambient is enough. -/
