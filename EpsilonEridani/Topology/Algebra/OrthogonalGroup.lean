# Closedness of the matrix special orthogonal group

The matrix special orthogonal group is the closed carrier used when a concrete orthogonal matrix
group is given its Lie-group structure.  Its defining equations are the transpose-isometry
equation and the determinant-one equation; both are closed in the entrywise matrix topology.

## Main result

* `Matrix.isClosed_orthogonalGroup` and `Matrix.isClosed_specialOrthogonalGroup`:
  the matrix orthogonal and special orthogonal groups are closed over any `T₁` topological
  commutative ring.

The closedness statements identify the topological input supplied by these carriers for later
constructions of Lie-group structures and continuity arguments on the corresponding subgroups.
