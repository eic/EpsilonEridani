# The uniform structure on a subring

A subring carries the subspace uniformity, and the two facts one needs about it hold already for
the underlying subobject: `AddSubgroup.isUniformAddGroup` gives the additive group structure at
`S.toAddSubgroup`, and a countably generated uniformity is inherited by any subtype. Neither is
keyed on `Subring`, so typeclass search reaches neither at `↥S`.

That is the same keying gap `EpsilonEridani.Topology.Algebra.IsUniformGroup.Submodule` fills for
submodules, and this file is its `Subring` counterpart. Both are uniform-space facts, which is why
they live beside each other here rather than in `EpsilonEridani.Topology.Algebra.Ring.Subring`, whose
subject is the *topological* structure of a subring.

Only `NonAssocRing` is needed: that is what `Subring` itself asks, and the proofs use nothing but
the additive subgroup and the subtype uniformity.

## Main results

* `Subring.isUniformAddGroup`: `↥S` is a uniform additive group.
* `Subring.isCountablyGenerated_uniformity`: `↥S` inherits a countably generated uniformity.

## The consumer

Both are wanted at the ring of definition of a rational localisation, where
`EpsilonEridani.Huber.PairOfDefinition.isStronglyNoetherian_completion` needs the completion of a subring
to be a uniform additive group with countably generated uniformity.
