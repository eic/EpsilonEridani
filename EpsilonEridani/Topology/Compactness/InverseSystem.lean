# Inverse limits of compact spaces are nonempty

An `InverseSystem f` over a preorder consists of types `X i` together with transition maps
`f h : X j → X i` for `i ≤ j`, composing along the order. A *compatible family*, or section, of
the system is an `x : ∀ i, X i` with `f h (x j) = x i` for every `i ≤ j`. The theorems here say
that such a family exists as soon as the index is directed and every `X i` is nonempty and
compact Hausdorff, and specialize that to the finite systems for which it is Kőnig's lemma.

The data stay unbundled: a family of transition maps and the two laws of `InverseSystem`, with
no functor and no category instance on the index. That is the shape such a system has when it
arises — the finite quotients of a profinite group and the maps between them, or the sets of
Sylow subgroups of those quotients — and a compatible family is then exactly a point of the
inverse limit, so these are the statements a construction of such a point applies directly. The
mathematics is Mathlib's Kőnig lemma for cofiltered systems and is not reproved here.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_forall_map_eq_of_compact_t2`: an inverse system of nonempty compact Hausdorff
  spaces over a directed index has a compatible family.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_forall_map_eq_of_finite`: the same for a system of nonempty finite types.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_forall_map_eq_of_codirected_of_finite`: the finite statement for a
  `DirectedSystem` over a codirected index, the form in which a system of finite quotients is
  usually written.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_forall_map_succ_eq_of_compact_t2`,
  `EpsilonEridani.exists_forall_map_succ_eq_of_finite`: the sequential forms, where the system is given
  by its one-step maps `β k : S (k + 1) → S k`.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_forall_map_succ_eq_and_forall_eq_of_surjective`: a compatible family in a
  tower of `T1` spaces lifts along a levelwise surjective map from a tower of compact Hausdorff
  spaces, to a compatible family upstairs. This is the exactness of sequential inverse limits of
  compact Hausdorff spaces, in the form used for towers of compact modules.
