# Homotopy groups are invariant under homotopy equivalence

Postcomposition with a continuous map induces a map on homotopy groups, and maps homotopic
relative to the base point induce the same one. A *free* homotopy `H` from `f` to `g` moves the
base point along its trace `H.evalAt x`, and the two induced maps then differ exactly by
base-point change. This is immediate from the machinery already in place: dragging a generalized
loop `p` through `H` is a homotopy along the trace, in the sense of
`EpsilonEridani.GenLoop.HomotopyAlong`, from `f ∘ p` to `g ∘ p`, and such a homotopy is canonical by
`EpsilonEridani.GenLoop.HomotopyAlong.homotopic_transport`.

The trace formula takes the base points of the two induced maps as equations, as
`HomotopyGroup.map` does, and the trace is recast along them with `Path.cast`. This is what lets
a round trip `g ∘ f ≃ id` be stated at the base points `g (f x)` and `x` themselves, rather than at
`(g.comp f) x` and `(ContinuousMap.id X) x`.

Applied to a homotopy equivalence `e : X ≃ₕ Y`, this makes each round trip of `e` bijective on
homotopy groups after correcting the base point. Both round trips are needed: a homotopy inverse
recovers the identity only up to a free homotopy, so one composite alone gives injectivity of the
map induced by `e.toFun` and surjectivity of the map induced by `e.invFun`, and the other
composite is what upgrades the latter to a bijection. The inverse of the resulting bijection is
the map induced by `e.invFun`, corrected by base-point change along the trace of the round trip.

The statements about the induced map alone need no finiteness of the index type beyond
`[Finite N]`; the statements that mention transport, which uses the collar construction, ask for
the `[Fintype N]` that the cube radius uses.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.GenLoop.homotopyAlongMap`: dragging a generalized loop through a homotopy is a
  homotopy along the trace of that homotopy at the base point.
* `EpsilonEridani.homotopyGroupTransport_map`: **freely homotopic maps induce the same map on homotopy
  groups, up to transport along the trace of the homotopy.**
* `EpsilonEridani.homotopyGroupTransport_map_map`: the case of a round trip `g ∘ f ≃ id`.
* `HomotopyGroup.map_bijective_of_homotopyEquiv`: a homotopy equivalence induces a bijection on
  homotopy groups.
* `HomotopyGroup.equivOfHomotopyEquiv`, `HomotopyGroup.mulEquivOfHomotopyEquiv`: that bijection,
  as an equivalence and, in positive dimensions, as a group isomorphism, with their identity and
  composition laws.

## References

That a homotopy equivalence induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups is Proposition 4.21 of
[hatcher02]; the trace formula for a free homotopy is the discussion preceding it in Section 4.1.
