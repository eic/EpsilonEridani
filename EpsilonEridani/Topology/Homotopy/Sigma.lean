# Paths in a disjoint union

A path in a disjoint union `Σ i, X i` never leaves the summand it starts in, because the unit
interval is connected: this is Mathlib's `ContinuousMap.exists_lift_sigma`. This file draws the
two consequences that the fundamental groupoid of a disjoint union needs, namely that the
endpoint of a path out of the `i`-th summand again lies in the `i`-th summand, and that a path
between two points of the `i`-th summand is the image of a path in that summand — the latter also
for path homotopy classes.

The inclusion of a summand is spelled out as the anonymous bundled map
`⟨Sigma.mk i, continuous_sigmaMk⟩` rather than `ContinuousMap.sigmaMk i`, because only the former
has an application that reduces definitionally, which the dependently typed rewrites downstream
need.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.sigmaFst_eq_of_path`: a path out of the `i`-th summand of a disjoint union ends in
  the `i`-th summand.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_path_map_sigmaMk_eq`: **a path between two points of the `i`-th summand is the
  image of a path in that summand.**
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_quotient_map_sigmaMk_eq`: the same for path homotopy classes.
