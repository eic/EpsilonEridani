# Path connectedness is a homotopy invariant

A homotopy equivalence `e : X ≃ₕ Y` is not surjective, so path connectedness of `Y` cannot be
read off from the image of a path in `X`. What replaces surjectivity is the trace of the
homotopy `e.toFun ∘ e.invFun ≃ id`: evaluated at a point `y`, it is a path from
`e.toFun (e.invFun y)` to `y`. Two points of `Y` are therefore joined to points in the image of
`e.toFun`, which are joined to each other because `X` is path connected.

This is the prerequisite for the base-point-free homotopy-group statements in
`EpsilonEridani.Topology.Homotopy.HomotopyGroup.HomotopyEquiv`, which need the target space to be path
connected before base-point change is available there.

## Main declarations

* `ContinuousMap.HomotopyEquiv.pathConnectedSpace`: a space homotopy equivalent to a path
  connected space is path connected.
