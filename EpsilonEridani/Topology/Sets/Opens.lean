# Carrying a basis from families of sets to families of opens

A basis of a topological space is presented in two ways in Mathlib, and neither is canonical:
`TopologicalSpace.IsTopologicalBasis` takes a `Set (Set X)`, while `TopologicalSpace.Opens.IsBasis`
takes a `Set (Opens X)`. This file bridges the first form to the second, for consumers stated in
terms of `Opens` — the sheaf-theoretic ones, since `Opens X` is the category a presheaf on `X` is
indexed by.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.TopologicalSpace.Opens.isBasis_of_isTopologicalBasis` : a basis presented as a family
  of sets yields one presented as a family of `Opens`.

/-- **A basis of sets is a basis of opens.** A basis presented as a `Set (Set X)`, the form
`TopologicalSpace.IsTopologicalBasis` takes, yields one presented as a `Set (Opens X)`, the form
`Opens.IsBasis` takes: keep the opens whose underlying set is a member. Nothing is lost, since
every member of a topological basis is open.

Both presentations occur in Mathlib and each has its own API, so this is a bridge between two
existing forms rather than a claim that either is the standard one. -/
