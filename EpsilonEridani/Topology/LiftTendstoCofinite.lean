# Lifting a convergent family along a surjection

A family `g : ι → N` converges to `n₀` along the cofinite filter when all but finitely many of its
members lie in any given neighbourhood of `n₀`. This file shows that a surjection which carries the
neighbourhood filter of `m₀` into that of `n₀` lifts such a family to one converging to `m₀`: the
lift can be chosen convergent, not merely made to exist.

**Openness is not the hypothesis, and would not suffice on its own.** `IsOpenMap φ` puts the image
of a neighbourhood of `m₀` around `φ m₀`, which is a neighbourhood of `n₀` only when `φ m₀ = n₀`.
The hypothesis used here is `𝓝 n₀ ≤ Filter.map φ (𝓝 m₀)`, which is exactly what the proof consumes;
a zero-preserving open surjection — an `A`-linear map, say — is one way to supply it, and that is
the form `EpsilonEridani.Huber` uses it in.

That the lifts exist pointwise is only surjectivity. The content is that they can be chosen
*uniformly enough to still converge*, and this genuinely needs a construction: choosing a preimage
of `g α` for each `α` independently can leave the lifts spread out even when the `g α` collapse to
`n₀`. The fix is to choose the preimage of `g α` from a neighbourhood whose index grows with `α`,
so that convergence is forced by the choice rather than hoped for.

## Main results

* `exists_lift_tendsto_cofinite_nhds`: the lifting statement.

## Implementation notes

Countability of `𝓝 m₀` enters only through `Filter.exists_antitone_basis`, which supplies the
antitone basis the lifts are drawn from. It is taken as an instance rather than as a basis in the
statement, so a caller neither has to produce a basis nor to re-prove the image condition index by
index: `𝓝 n₀ ≤ Filter.map φ (𝓝 m₀)` gives the latter uniformly.

The index of the neighbourhood a lift is drawn from is
`Nat.findGreatest (fun m ↦ g α ∈ φ '' V m) (r α)`, where `r` is an injection of `ι` into `ℕ` —
one exists because `ι` is countable, and it tends to infinity cofinitely because `cofinite` is
`atTop` on `ℕ`. **The cap by `r α` is what makes the definition total.** Without it the natural
index is the largest `m` with `g α ∈ φ '' V m`, and no largest one need exist: the set of such `m`
can be empty, which is the common case, and it can equally be unbounded, when `g α` lies in every
`φ '' V m`. `Nat.findGreatest` returns a usable index in both cases, so capping removes them
rather than splitting on them.

No algebraic structure is used: `M` and `N` carry only a topology and a distinguished point. In
particular the neighbourhoods drawn from are not assumed to be subgroups, which the argument would
need if it ever added two lifts — it never does, choosing each independently. Nothing about `m₀`
and `n₀` is used beyond their neighbourhood filters — no zero, and no algebra.

/-- **A convergent family lifts to a convergent family.** If `φ` is surjective and carries the
neighbourhood filter of `m₀` into that of `n₀`, then any family tending to `n₀` cofinitely has a
`φ`-preimage family tending to `m₀` cofinitely.

Pointwise lifting is surjectivity alone; the statement is that a *single* choice of lifts can be
made to converge. Note that `IsOpenMap φ` supplies the filter hypothesis only together with
`φ m₀ = n₀`; openness by itself places the images around `φ m₀`, not around `n₀`.

**Two countability hypotheses are essential**, and both are instance arguments rather than
explicit ones. `[(𝓝 m₀).IsCountablyGenerated]` is what produces the antitone basis the lifts are
drawn from, and `[Countable ι]` — from the variable block — is what supplies the injection
`ι ↪ ℕ` that caps the construction. Neither is bookkeeping: without the first there is no
sequence of neighbourhoods to index, and without the second the cap has nothing to grow along. -/
