# The one-point compactification of the real line as a Jordan curve

The real projective line, topologically the one-point compactification `OnePoint ℝ`, is a
circle.  This file records the resulting homeomorphism and the corresponding Jordan-curve fact.
They let maps on the extended real boundary be treated using the Jordan-curve API.

The construction uses Mathlib's stereographic homeomorphism from the one-point compactification
of a finite-dimensional real vector space to a sphere.  The standard orthonormal basis
`![1, Complex.I]` then identifies the resulting two-dimensional Euclidean sphere with
`Circle`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.onePointRealHomeomorphCircle` -- a homeomorphism from `OnePoint ℝ` to `Circle`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isJordanCurve_univ_onePoint_real` -- the whole real projective line is a Jordan curve.

/-- The one-point compactification of the real line is homeomorphic to the circle.

Mathlib's `onePointEquivSphereOfFinrankEq` realizes it as the unit sphere in two-dimensional
Euclidean space.  The standard orthonormal basis of `ℂ` carries that sphere isometrically onto
the unit sphere in `ℂ`, which is definitionally `Circle`. -/
