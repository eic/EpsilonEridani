# Two points cut a Jordan curve into two arcs

Removing one point from a Jordan curve leaves a path-connected set; removing two leaves exactly two
pieces. This file proves both, first for the model curve `Circle` and then for an arbitrary Jordan
curve by transport along the homeomorphism that `EpsilonEridani.IsJordanCurve` provides.

## The argument on the circle

Both circle statements come straight out of Mathlib's arc API. For one point,
`Circle.isPathConnected_compl_singleton` is exactly the statement, and is used directly. For two
distinct points `z` and `w`,
Mathlib parametrizes the two arcs they determine by the paths `Circle.path z w` and
`Circle.path w z`, and records that the two ranges meet exactly in `{z, w}`
(`Circle.range_path_inter_range_path`) and that each open arc is the complement of the opposite
closed one (`Circle.compl_range_path`). So the two open arcs are complements of compact sets, hence
*open*, and they are path connected as continuous images of the interval `Set.Ioo 0 1`; openness is
what makes the pair a genuine separation rather than merely a partition.

## Why this is a layer-L5 prerequisite

Layer **L5** of the conformal-mapping roadmap (`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`) is
Carathéodory's boundary correspondence, and the injectivity half of its hard direction argues by
contradiction: if the continuous extension of a Riemann map identified two distinct points of the
bounding circle, those two points would cut the circle into two arcs, and the geometry of the image
would force the extension to be constant on one of them — which
`EpsilonEridani.not_eqOn_const_inter_sphere_of_injOn` in
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/ArcConstancy.lean` rules out. That file records the missing
input explicitly: "two identified boundary points cut the circle into two arcs" is a statement about
the curve, not about the map. Mathlib cuts the *circle*; what this file adds is the same cutting for
an arbitrary Jordan curve, which is the generality the argument needs, since it applies the cutting
to `frontier Ω` — a Jordan curve, not a circle — on the image side.

## Generality

The Jordan-curve statements are for a subset of an arbitrary topological space, as in
`EpsilonEridani/Topology/JordanCurve/Basic.lean`; no separation axiom is needed, because the curve carries
the subspace topology of a space homeomorphic to the circle and every hypothesis is checked there.
The corollaries for a circle `Metric.sphere c r` of `ℂ` are the case the conformal layers consume.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsJordanCurve.isPathConnected_sdiff_singleton` — a Jordan curve minus a point is path
  connected; for a point of the curve it is an *open* arc — homeomorphic to a punctured circle, not
  to a closed interval — and in particular one point never separates the curve.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_isOpen_isPathConnected_union_eq_compl_pair_circle` — two distinct points cut the
  circle into two disjoint nonempty open path-connected arcs.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsJordanCurve.exists_isPathConnected_union_eq_sdiff_pair` — the same for an arbitrary
  Jordan curve, together with the statement that the two arcs are its connected components: every
  preconnected subset of the cut curve lies in one of them.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsJordanCurve.not_isPreconnected_sdiff_pair` — consequently two points always separate a
  Jordan curve.
* `EpsilonEridani.isPathConnected_sphere_sdiff_singleton`,
  `EpsilonEridani.exists_isPathConnected_union_eq_sphere_sdiff_pair` and
  `EpsilonEridani.not_isPreconnected_sphere_sdiff_pair` — the three statements for a circle of `ℂ`, the
  form in which the bounding circle of a disc is cut.

under `Path.extend`, which reparametrizes `Circle.path u v` by all of `ℝ` and so lets the
path-connectedness be read off the convexity of `Ioo 0 1`. -/

/-- **Two distinct points cut the circle into two arcs.** The complement of `{z, w}` is the union
of two disjoint nonempty open path-connected sets, namely the two open arcs
`Circle.path z w '' Ioo 0 1` and `Circle.path w z '' Ioo 0 1` that Mathlib cuts the circle into.

Openness is the substantive part: it says the two arcs are a *separation* of `{z, w}ᶜ`, so that no
connected subset of the cut circle can meet both, which is how the pair is used. Each open arc is
the complement of the opposite closed arc by `Circle.compl_range_path`, hence open because a range
of a path is compact; and the two closed arcs meet in `{z, w}` by
`Circle.range_path_inter_range_path`, which is the union statement. -/

/-! ## Cutting a Jordan curve

Both statements below are the circle statement carried across the parametrization
`EpsilonEridani.jordanParam e` of a Jordan curve by the circle, whose properties — continuity,
injectivity, range, and that it is inducing — are in
`EpsilonEridani/Topology/JordanCurve/Basic.lean`. -/

/-- **A Jordan curve minus a point is path connected**, being homeomorphic to the circle minus a
point (`Circle.isPathConnected_compl_singleton`). So a Jordan curve is *not* separated by any one of
its points; it takes two, by `EpsilonEridani.IsJordanCurve.not_isPreconnected_sdiff_pair`. The point need
not lie on the curve: removing one that does not leaves the curve itself. -/

/-- **Two distinct points cut a Jordan curve into two arcs.** For `p ≠ q` on a Jordan curve `C`
there are two disjoint path-connected sets `A` and `B` with `A ∪ B = C \ {p, q}`, and they are the
connected components of the cut curve: every preconnected subset of `C \ {p, q}` lies inside one of
them.

The last clause is what makes the pair canonical, and is the form the Carathéodory boundary
argument uses: a connected set that avoids `p` and `q` cannot get from one arc to the other. It
comes from openness of the two arcs of the circle in
`EpsilonEridani.exists_isOpen_isPathConnected_union_eq_compl_pair_circle`, transported along the
parametrization, which is an inducing map, so preconnectedness may be tested upstairs. -/
