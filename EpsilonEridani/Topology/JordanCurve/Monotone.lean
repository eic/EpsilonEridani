# Monotone maps from a Jordan curve

A continuous map from a Jordan curve is called *monotone* when each of its point fibres is
connected. This file records the rigidity consequence needed by the Carathéodory boundary
correspondence: a monotone map whose fibres have empty interior is injective.

The argument is intrinsic to the curve. A point fibre is compact by continuity and compactness of
the Jordan curve, and it is preconnected by monotonicity. If it had two points, the classification
of subcontinua of a Jordan curve in `EpsilonEridani/Topology/JordanCurve/Subcontinuum.lean` would force it
to contain a relative open arc. Equivalently, the nowhere-dense criterion
`EpsilonEridani.IsJordanCurve.subsingleton_of_subset_closure_sdiff` makes every fibre a subsingleton.

The theorem is phrased for a map whose domain is the subtype `C`. Thus its fibres and their
interiors are taken in the topology of the curve itself, which is the natural form for boundary
maps and avoids an ambient-space side condition.

## Main result

* `EpsilonEridani.IsJordanCurve.injective_of_isPreconnected_fiber_of_interior_fiber_eq_empty` — a
  continuous map from a Jordan curve with preconnected, interiorless point fibres is injective.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsJordanCurve.injective_iff_isPreconnected_fiber_of_interior_fiber_eq_empty` — under
  the same interior condition, monotonicity is equivalent to injectivity.

/-- **A monotone map from a Jordan curve with interiorless fibres is injective.** Let `C` be a
Jordan curve and `g : C → Y` a continuous map to a `T₁` space. If every point fibre of `g` is
preconnected and has empty interior in `C`, then `g` is injective.

Continuity makes each fibre closed, hence compact because `C` is compact. Empty interior says its
complement is dense. The fibre is therefore a nowhere-dense subcontinuum of the Jordan curve, so
`EpsilonEridani.IsJordanCurve.subsingleton_of_subset_closure_sdiff` makes it a subsingleton. -/

/-- **For an interiorless-fibre map from a Jordan curve, monotonicity is equivalent to
injectivity.** The forward implication is
`EpsilonEridani.IsJordanCurve.injective_of_isPreconnected_fiber_of_interior_fiber_eq_empty`. Conversely,
an injective map has empty or singleton point fibres, hence preconnected fibres; this direction
needs neither continuity nor the Jordan-curve hypothesis. -/
