# The deviation of an `Lᵖ` function from a constant

On a finite measure space the `Lᵖ` seminorm of `fun x => f x - a`, for a constant `a`, is the
`Lᵖ` distance from `f` to the constant class `MeasureTheory.Lp.const`.  The identity is the
bridge between the seminorm form of an estimate on the deviation from a constant and its norm
form, in which both sides are continuous functions of the `Lᵖ` class and so pass to limits.

## Main declaration

* `EpsilonEridani.eLpNorm_sub_const_eq_enorm`: the deviation from a constant as a distance in `Lᵖ`.
