# Products of discrete σ-algebras

The product of the discrete σ-algebras on two countable types is again discrete. Countability is
what makes this work: the measurable rectangles already exhaust the singletons of the product, and
countably many of them suffice to build any subset.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.prod_top_eq_top_of_countable`: the product of the discrete σ-algebras on
  two countable types is discrete.
