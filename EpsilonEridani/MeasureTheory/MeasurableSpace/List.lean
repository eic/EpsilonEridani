# The measurable structure on lists

Mathlib equips no type of lists with a measurable structure. This file gives `List α` the structure
transported from its length-indexed representation `Σ n, Fin n → α`. Thus each fixed-length stratum
has the finite product structure, and the list space is their countable disjoint union.

When `α` is countable with measurable singletons, this structure is discrete. In particular, a
process whose values are finite words over a countable alphabet, such as the excursion process of a
path, has a countable discrete value space.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.instMeasurableSpaceList`: the measurable structure on `List α` induced by its
  length-indexed representation.
* `EpsilonEridani.instDiscreteMeasurableSpaceList`: discreteness when `α` is countable with measurable
  singletons.
