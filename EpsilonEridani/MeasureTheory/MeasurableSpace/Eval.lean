# Evaluating a measurable family at a measurable index

Mathlib's `Measurable.eval` evaluates a measurable map into a product at a **fixed** coordinate.
This file records the variant where the coordinate is itself a measurable function of the point,
which is what a recursion whose next index is read off the current state needs.

The hypotheses on the index type are standard sufficient conditions for such a statement:
countably many coordinates, each of them a measurable set, so that the fibres of the index map cut
the domain into countably many measurable pieces on which the evaluation is an ordinary coordinate
projection. They are not individually necessary in degenerate cases. For suitable nontrivial
measurable spaces over an uncountable index type, however, the diagonal `fun (x, i) => x i` need not
be measurable for the product σ-algebra.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.measurable_eval_index`: measurability of `fun b => g b (f b)`.

/-- **A measurable family evaluated at a measurable index is measurable.** Over a countable index
type with measurable points, `fun b => g b (f b)` is measurable as soon as the family `g` and the
index `f` are: the fibres of `f` are countably many measurable sets, and on each of them the
evaluation is a coordinate projection of `g`. -/
