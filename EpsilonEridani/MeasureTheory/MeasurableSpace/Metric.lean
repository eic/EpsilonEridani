# Measurable discretization of totally bounded pseudometric spaces

This file provides a finite measurable approximation of a totally bounded pseudometric space whose
open sets are measurable.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_measurable_dist_lt` — a totally bounded pseudometric space admits a measurable map
  to a finite type whose indexed approximation point is uniformly close to every point.
