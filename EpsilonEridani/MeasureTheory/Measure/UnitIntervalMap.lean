# Realizing a probability law by a map from the unit interval

Every standard Borel probability space `(Ω, μ)` receives a measure-preserving map from
`(I, volume)`: there is `f : I → Ω` with `volume.map f = μ`. This is Theorem A.9 of Janson's
*Graphons, cut norm and distance, couplings and rearrangements*.

**Atoms are allowed.** No atomless hypothesis appears, and none is needed: the statement is an
existence claim about a map *into* `Ω`, not a bijection, so a law concentrated on finitely many
points is realized by a step function on `I`. The regressions below pin this down at a Dirac mass,
at a finite mixture, and at a mixture of an atom with a continuous part — the cases where an
atomless reading of the theorem would fail.

This is the transport underlying the Layer 5 identification of coupling cut distance with the
classical measure-preserving-map infimum: every coupling, being itself standard Borel, is realized
by a pair of such maps. That identification is not proved here.

## Main results

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.exists_measurePreserving_from_unitInterval` — a measure-preserving
  `f : I → Ω` realizing any standard-Borel probability law.

## Implementation

Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.Measure.exists_measurable_map_eq` already supplies the function and the
pushforward identity; the content here is packaging them as `MeasurePreserving`, which is
definitionally that pair. Mathlib states it with `[Nonempty Ω]`, which is not carried here: a
probability measure on `Ω` already forces `Ω` to be nonempty, and
`nonempty_of_isProbabilityMeasure` supplies the instance inside the proof.

/-! ### Regressions: the atomic cases

`exists_measurePreserving_from_unitInterval` is stated without an atomless hypothesis. These three
instantiations are what that buys, and they fail for any formulation that quietly assumes `μ` has
no atoms. -/
