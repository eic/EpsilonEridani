# Measures on a finite partial order are determined by their upper sets

Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.Measure.ext_of_Ici` says that a finite Borel measure on a second-countable
linear order is determined by its values on the closed upper rays `Set.Ici a`. On a *finite*
partial order no topology is needed, and neither is a total order: the ray `Set.Ici a` is the point
`a` together with the strictly larger points, so downward induction along the order recovers the
mass of every singleton from the masses of the rays, and a measure on a countable space with
measurable singletons is determined by its singletons.

The same downward induction shows that a family of finite measures on a finite partial order,
indexed by a measurable space, is measurable into the Giry σ-algebra once its evaluations on the
upper rays are measurable.

The typical consumers are laws on finite lattices of finite graphs, where the mass of a ray is the
probability that a random graph contains a fixed pattern, and on products of such lattices.

## Main results

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.ext_of_Ici_of_finite` — two measures on a finite partial order with
  measurable singletons, the first of them finite, agree once they agree on every `Set.Ici a`;
* `Measurable.measure_of_Ici_of_finite` — a family of finite measures on such an order is
  measurable once each of its upper-ray evaluations is.

all closed upper rays `Set.Ici a` and the first is finite: the ray at `a` is `a` together with the
strictly larger points, so downward induction recovers the mass of every singleton. -/

/-- A family of finite measures on a finite partial order with measurable singletons is measurable
as soon as its value on every closed upper ray `Set.Ici a` depends measurably on the parameter:
the mass of `{a}` is the mass of the ray at `a` minus the finitely many singleton masses strictly
above `a`, so downward induction makes every singleton evaluation measurable, and every set is a
finite union of singletons. -/
