# Measurability of measure-valued maps

This file supplies general-purpose measurability results for maps into the Giry measurable space
of measures.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.measurable_sum_smul_dirac` — a countable mixture of Dirac measures at
  fixed atoms is measurable when each weight is measurable.
* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.measurable_probabilityMeasure_map` — pushing forward along a fixed
  measurable map is measurable on `ProbabilityMeasure`.
* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.measurable_map_of_measurable_uncurry` — pushing a fixed s-finite measure
  forward along a jointly measurable family of maps is measurable in the parameter.

/-- A countable mixture of Dirac measures at fixed atoms `g i` is measurable in the weights.

Evaluating on a measurable set turns the measure into the sum
`∑' i, f b i * 1_{g i ∈ s}`, and a `tsum` of measurable functions is measurable. The atoms are
indexed by a countable type of their own, so the ambient space `α` may be uncountable. -/
