# The density of a set upstairs, seen on the base of a measure-preserving map

Let `f : Ω' → Ω` push a measure `ν` forward to a σ-finite measure `μ`, and let `s ⊆ Ω'` be a
set upstairs.
The part of `ν` carried by `s` pushes forward to a measure `≤ μ`, so it has a Radon–Nikodym
density with respect to `μ` taking values in `[0, 1]`. That density is
`mapRestrictDensity f ν μ s`, and
it is characterised by

`∫ a, mapRestrictDensity f ν μ s a * g a ∂μ = ∫ x in s, g (f x) ∂ν`

for every `μ`-a.e. strongly measurable `g : Ω → ℝ` (`integral_mapRestrictDensity_mul`). This
Radon–Nikodym identity holds for arbitrary `s`. When `s` is measurable, the density has the
additional probabilistic reading of the conditional probability of `s` given `f`: composing it
with `f` gives a version of `ν[s.indicator 1 | comap f]`. Nothing here needs that reading, so the
conditional-expectation machinery is not used; the elementary Radon–Nikodym route is enough.

**Truncation is deliberate.** The definition applies `min 1` to the Radon–Nikodym derivative so
that the `[0, 1]` bounds hold *everywhere*, not merely almost everywhere. Consumers pair this
function against a kernel and need a strict pointwise bound to feed an extremal argument; the
truncation is invisible to every integral statement below, because it changes the derivative only
on a `μ`-null set (`mapRestrictDensity_ae_eq_rnDeriv`).
The private product-carrier regression below confirms that the density can be a genuinely
fractional multiple of an indicator, rather than always an indicator itself.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.mapRestrictDensity` — the `[0, 1]`-valued density on the base of the part
  of `ν` carried by a set upstairs.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.integral_mapRestrictDensity_mul` — the characterising identity: integrating
  against the density downstairs computes the integral over the set upstairs. No measurability of
  the set is needed.
* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.mapRestrictDensity_ae_eq_rnDeriv` — the truncation is a.e. invisible.
* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.mapRestrictDensity_mem_Icc` — the density lies in `[0, 1]` everywhere.
* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.integral_mapRestrictDensity` — the density integrates to the measure of
  the set, the case `g = 1`.
* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.mapRestrictDensity_congr_set` — the density depends on the set upstairs
  only through its `ν`-a.e. class; this equality is exact, not almost everywhere.
* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.mapRestrictDensity_preimage` and
  `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.mapRestrictDensity_univ` — on a
  preimage the density collapses `μ`-almost everywhere to an indicator, so the construction extends
  the trivial case.
* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.isFiniteMeasure_of_measurePreserving` — an auxiliary fact transferring
  finiteness from the source to the target of a measure-preserving map.

## References

* Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.toReal_rnDeriv_map` identifies the Radon–Nikodym derivative of a
  pushforward with a conditional expectation; it is the abstract form of the reading above and is
  not needed for any statement here.

/-- The **density on the base of the part of `ν` carried by `s`**: the Radon–Nikodym derivative of
`(ν.restrict s).map f` with respect to `μ`, truncated to `[0, 1]`.

When `f` pushes `ν` forward to `μ` the truncation is a.e. invisible
(`mapRestrictDensity_ae_eq_rnDeriv`) and the function is characterised by
`integral_mapRestrictDensity_mul`. The measures are explicit arguments because neither is
determined by the others: `μ` is not forced to be `ν.map f` by the type. -/

/-- **The density is `[0, 1]`-valued everywhere.**  The upper bound is what the truncation in the

/-- **On a preimage the density is `μ`-almost everywhere an indicator.**  Nothing is lost when the
set upstairs is already cut out by a set on the base, so `mapRestrictDensity` extends the trivial
case rather than replacing it.

The conclusion is only `μ`-a.e., as it must be: the Radon–Nikodym derivative is itself defined only
up to a `μ`-null set. -/

/-- **The density genuinely takes fractional values.**  On a product carrier projected to its first
factor, a rectangle `s ×ˢ t` has density `ν.real t · 1_s` `μ`-almost everywhere: the second factor
contributes its mass, not an indicator.  Together with `mapRestrictDensity_preimage` this pins the
construction down — an indicator of a set on the base would be wrong whenever
`0 < ν.real t < 1`. -/
