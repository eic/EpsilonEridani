# Convex combinations of probability measures

`ProbabilityMeasure α` carries no addition and no scalar action: it is a subtype of `Measure α`,
and neither `P + Q` nor `c • P` is a probability measure. What it does carry is a convex structure,
and this file names it. For weights `a + b = 1`, `a • P + b • Q` is again a probability measure, and
`ProbabilityMeasure.convexComb` is that combination, bundled.

Naming the bundled combination is what lets a statement about a map out of `ProbabilityMeasure α`
say "affine" without coercing to `Measure α` and rebuilding the probability-measure structure at
every step.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.isProbabilityMeasure_smul_add_smul` — the unbundled fact about total mass,
  the prerequisite for the bundling.
* `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.convexComb` — the bundled combination, characterized by
  `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.toMeasure_convexComb`.

`convexComb` and `toMeasure_convexComb` are declared in the root
`MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure` namespace rather than under `EpsilonEridani`, since the type is
Mathlib's; that is what lets `P.convexComb hab Q` be written as dot notation, generalized field
notation inserting `P` at the first explicit `ProbabilityMeasure` argument whatever the weight
hypothesis's position. The prerequisite `isProbabilityMeasure_smul_add_smul` is about `Measure`,
not `ProbabilityMeasure`, and stays under `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory`.

/-! ### The bundled combination

`ProbabilityMeasure` is Mathlib's type, so its namespace is Mathlib's: the definition and its
characteristic lemma sit in the root `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure`, not under `EpsilonEridani`, which
is what makes `P.convexComb hab Q` elaborate as dot notation. -/
