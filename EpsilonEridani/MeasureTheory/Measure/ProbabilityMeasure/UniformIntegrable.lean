# Integrals of unbounded functions along weakly convergent probability measures

Weak convergence `μᵢ ⇀ μ` of probability measures is defined by convergence of the integrals of
bounded continuous functions. For an *unbounded* continuous function `g : Ω → ℝ≥0` the integrals
`∫⁻ g ∂μᵢ` need not converge to `∫⁻ g ∂μ`: mass escaping to the region where `g` is large can
carry a non-vanishing share of the integral. This file proves that this is the only obstruction.
The integrals converge exactly when the tails of `g` are *uniformly integrable along the family*:
for every `ε > 0` there is a level `R` such that eventually `∫⁻ x in {x | R ≤ g x}, g x ∂μᵢ ≤ ε`.

This is the measure-theoretic core of the characterization of convergence in the `p`-Wasserstein
distance by weak convergence together with convergence of `p`-moments, where `g` is the `p`-th
power of the distance to a basepoint.

Both directions compare `g` with its truncations `min g R`, which are bounded continuous and hence
have converging integrals, and use that `g - R` and the tail `g` on `{x | 2 R ≤ g x}` control
each other. No metric structure on `Ω` and no finiteness of `∫⁻ g ∂μ` is needed for the
sufficiency of the tail condition; the necessity needs `∫⁻ g ∂μ ≠ ∞`.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.tendsto_lintegral_of_tendsto_probabilityMeasure` — uniformly integrable tails along a
  weakly convergent family give convergence of the integrals;
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_setLIntegral_le_of_tendsto_lintegral` — conversely, convergence of the
  integrals to a finite limit gives uniformly integrable tails;
* `EpsilonEridani.tendsto_lintegral_iff_forall_exists_setLIntegral_le` — the resulting equivalence.
