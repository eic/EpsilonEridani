# Transporting canonical probability-measure codes

The canonical code of a probability measure on a countably generated measurable space records its
values on a countable generating set algebra.  Besides determining the measure, these coordinates
generate the Giry measurable space on `ProbabilityMeasure α`.  Thus every measurable function of a
probability measure into a nonempty standard Borel space factors measurably through its code.

In particular, a measurable map `f : α → β` induces a measurable map between the ambient code
spaces.  On codes which represent probability measures, `probabilityMeasureCodeMap f hf` sends the
code of `P` to the code of `P.map f`.  Its values on non-representable codes are an arbitrary
measurable extension; the characteristic theorem deliberately specifies only realizable codes.
This lets measure-valued arguments work in a standard Borel code space without choosing a topology
on either value space.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.probabilityMeasureCodeMap` -- measurable transport of codes along a
  measurable map;
* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.probabilityMeasureCodeMap_apply` -- on realizable codes this transport is
  pushforward of the represented probability measure.
