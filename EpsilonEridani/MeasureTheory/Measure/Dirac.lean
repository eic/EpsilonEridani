# Dirac measures and their pushforwards

Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.Measure.map_dirac'` computes `(Measure.dirac x).map T = Measure.dirac
(T x)` for a measurable `T`. A Dirac measure leaves a map no room to be modified on a null set:
its only null sets avoid `x`, so a `Measure.dirac x`-a.e. measurable map already agrees at `x`
with the measurable representative it is a.e. equal to. The pushforward formula therefore holds
under that weaker hypothesis, which is the one a.e.-measurable interfaces such as
`ProbabilityTheory.HasLaw` provide.

## Main results

* `Measure.map_dirac_of_aemeasurable` — the Dirac pushforward formula for a map that is
  only a.e. measurable.
* `Measure.dirac_eq_dirac_of_inseparable` — inseparable points have equal Borel Dirac measures.
