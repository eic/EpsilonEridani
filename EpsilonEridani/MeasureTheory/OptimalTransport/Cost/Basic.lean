# The transport cost of two measures

Given a cost `c : X × Y → ℝ≥0∞`, the *transport cost* of `μ` and `ν` is the infimum of
`∫⁻ z, c z ∂π` over the couplings `π` of `μ` and `ν`. This is the value of the primal
Kantorovich problem, and it is the root definition of optimal transport: every later notion —
Wasserstein distance, Kantorovich duality, transport maps — is a statement about this number or
about the plans that attain it.

The definition is made for arbitrary measures on arbitrary measurable spaces, with an
extended-nonnegative cost integrated by `lintegral`. Nothing is assumed about topology,
finiteness, or normalisation, and no compactness is built in. An empty feasible set — for
instance measures of different total mass — gives the value `∞`, as does a cost that is too
large on every plan; the two are separated by
`EpsilonEridani.exists_isCoupling_of_transportCost_ne_top`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.transportCost c μ ν` — the infimum of `∫⁻ z, c z ∂π` over the couplings `π` of `μ`
  and `ν`;
* `EpsilonEridani.IsOptimalCoupling c π μ ν` — the predicate cutting out the optimal plans: `π` is a
  coupling of `μ` and `ν` whose cost is `transportCost c μ ν`.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_le_lintegral` and `EpsilonEridani.le_transportCost` — the two halves of the
  universal property of the infimum, with `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_lt_iff` its order-theoretic
  restatement;
* `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_mono`, `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_congr`, `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_const`,
  `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_const_mul` and `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_add_split` — monotonicity in the
  cost, invariance under a change of cost that is a.e. invisible to every feasible plan, the
  value of a constant cost, positive scaling, and the effect of adding integrable terms
  depending on one variable each;
* `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_comp_swap`, `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_comm` and
  `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_comp_prodMap` — functoriality: exchanging the two factors, symmetry for
  a symmetric cost, and invariance under measurable equivalences of the two factors;
* `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_dirac_left`, `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_dirac_right` and
  `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_dirac_dirac` — the exact value when either marginal is a Dirac
  measure, where the plan is unique;
* `EpsilonEridani.isOptimalCoupling_iff` — optimality is minimality among feasible plans, so it does
  not depend on the value `transportCost c μ ν` being finite, with the left and right Dirac
  lemmas giving the first families of optimal plans;
* `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_le_lintegral_of_hasLaw` — the Monge-to-Kantorovich inequality: the
  transport cost of `μ` and `ν` is at most the cost `∫⁻ x, c (x, T x) ∂μ` of any transport map
  `T` from `μ` to `ν`, with `EpsilonEridani.isOptimalCoupling_graphPlan_iff` its equality case.

## Implementation notes

The infimum is written as an iterated `⨅` over plans and over proofs of `EpsilonEridani.IsCoupling`,
so that it is `∞` on an empty feasible set with no case split, and so that
`EpsilonEridani.transportCost_le_lintegral` is `iInf₂_le`.

Invariance of the transport cost under a change of the cost function needs the two costs to
agree a.e. for *every* feasible plan, not merely `μ.prod ν`-a.e.: a coupling can be singular
with respect to the product measure — the diagonal plan of `μ` with itself on a diffuse `μ` is —
so a `μ.prod ν`-null set can carry all the mass of some competitor. This is why
`EpsilonEridani.transportCost_congr` quantifies over plans.

Measurability of the cost is assumed only where it is used, namely in the theorems that move an
integral along a pushforward (`EpsilonEridani.transportCost_comp_swap`,
`EpsilonEridani.transportCost_comp_prodMap` and the Dirac formulas). The order-theoretic API needs
none.

The Monge-to-Kantorovich inequality is a statement about the transport cost, so it is stated
here; the graph plan that witnesses it and the change of variables it uses come from
`EpsilonEridani/MeasureTheory/OptimalTransport/GraphPlan.lean`, which is below this module. Its
inequality half needs no measurability of the cost at all, since only one half of the change of
variables, `MeasureTheory.lintegral_map_le`, is used.

This supplies the nonnegative-cost interface from Layer 1, item 1 of the optimal-transport
roadmap. The parallel signed `EReal` interface for costs bounded below by an integrable split
function is a separate definition family and is not part of this module.

* C. Villani, *Topics in Optimal Transportation*, Graduate Studies in Mathematics 58, 2003,
  §1.1.1, where "Kantorovich's mass transportation problem consists in minimizing the linear
  functional `π ↦ ∫ c dπ`" over the transference plans. Villani takes `μ` and `ν` to be
  probability measures and `c` nonnegative measurable; `EpsilonEridani.transportCost` drops the
  normalisation and reads `c` into `ℝ≥0∞`, so an infeasible pair simply gets the value `∞`.
