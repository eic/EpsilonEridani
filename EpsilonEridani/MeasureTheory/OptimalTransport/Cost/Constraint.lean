# Closed constraints in optimal transport

An infinite barrier charges zero on an allowed set of pairs and infinity elsewhere. Its
integral vanishes exactly for plans concentrated on the allowed set. Because each plan costs
either zero or infinity, the transport value is zero exactly when a constrained coupling
exists, and infinity otherwise. This remains valid for arbitrary measures and measurable
constraints. A closed constraint also gives a lower semicontinuous cost.

The cost formula for an individual plan and the feasibility characterization require only
measurability of the constraint; topology enters only in the lower semicontinuity lemma.
