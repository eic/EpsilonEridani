# Bounded transport costs along weakly convergent marginals

A cost `c : X × X → ℝ≥0∞` that is bounded and vanishes uniformly near the diagonal — for every
`ε > 0` there is `δ > 0` with `c (x, y) ≤ ε` whenever `edist x y < δ` — measures how far apart two
laws are. This file proves that on a separable pseudometric space every such transport cost tends
to `0` along a weakly convergent family of probability measures: if `μᵢ ⇀ μ`, then
`transportCost c μᵢ μ → 0`. Bounded costs such as `min (edist x y) R ^ p` are the truncations
through which the convergence of Wasserstein distances is reduced to weak convergence and the
convergence of moments.

The proof transports mass cell by cell along a finite partition of the space, using the
deterministic estimate `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_le_sum_of_partition`. The cells are the pieces cut
out by finitely many small balls centred at the points of a dense sequence, with radii chosen so
that the limit law does not charge any of the bounding spheres. The masses of such cells converge
by the portmanteau theorem, so the excess mass tends to `0`, while the balls leave only a small
mass of the limit law outside them.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.tendsto_transportCost_of_tendsto_probabilityMeasure` — a bounded cost vanishing
  uniformly near the diagonal has transport cost tending to `0` along a weakly convergent family.

/-- **Bounded transport costs along weak convergence.** On a separable pseudometric space, let
`c : X × X → ℝ≥0∞` be a bounded cost vanishing uniformly near the diagonal: for every `ε > 0`
there is `δ > 0` such that `c (x, y) ≤ ε` whenever `edist x y < δ`. If probability measures `μᵢ`
converge weakly to `μ`, then the transport cost of `c` from `μᵢ` to `μ` tends to `0`. -/
