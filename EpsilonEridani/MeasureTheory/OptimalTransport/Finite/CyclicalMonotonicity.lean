# Cyclical monotonicity of finite optimal transport plans

On finite spaces, Kantorovich duality gives a contact-potential certificate for every optimal
transportation matrix. This file uses the existential complementary-slackness theorem in
`EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.OptimalTransport.Finite.Duality` to deduce that the support of every
optimal matrix is `c`-cyclically monotone.

The cost used by the finite linear program is real-valued. The cyclical-monotonicity API uses
extended-nonnegative costs, so the first theorem is stated for a nonnegative real cost. The
second treats a possibly infinite `ℝ≥0∞`-valued cost that is finite on the matrix support, but
its optimality hypothesis is explicitly for the real program obtained with `ENNReal.toReal`.
In that program an infinite cost becomes zero, so it represents optimality for the original
cost only when the cost is everywhere finite.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.TransportMatrix.isCyclicallyMonotone_toPMF_support_of_forall_cost_le` shows that the
  support of a matrix minimizing a nonnegative real cost is cyclically monotone for the
  corresponding extended-nonnegative cost.
* `EpsilonEridani.TransportMatrix.isCyclicallyMonotone_toPMF_support_of_forall_cost_toReal_le` gives the
  same conclusion for an extended-nonnegative cost finite on the support, when the matrix is
  optimal for the cost after applying `ENNReal.toReal` pointwise.

The converse from cyclical monotonicity alone is not proved here. Its general Polish-space form
is the Schachermayer--Teichmann theorem and requires the contact-potential representation that
remains later in Layer 2 of the optimal-transport roadmap.

/-- **The finite extended-cost form.** If an extended-nonnegative cost is finite on the support
of a transportation matrix minimizing its real-valued image, then that support is cyclically
monotone for the original cost. Optimality here is for the pointwise `ENNReal.toReal` image,
where an infinite cost has value zero; it is therefore not optimality for the original cost
unless that cost is everywhere finite. -/
