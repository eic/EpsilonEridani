# Stability of the primal transport problem under varying marginals and costs

A family of transport problems indexed by a filter is *stable* when its optimal values converge to
the optimal value of a limiting problem, and its optimal plans accumulate only on optimal plans of
that limiting problem. This file proves both, from two hypotheses that are stated explicitly rather
than packaged: a lower bound on the asymptotic cost of weakly convergent feasible families
(`EpsilonEridani.IsCostLiminfStable`), and an upper bound produced by approximating each limiting plan
(`EpsilonEridani.HasRecoveryPlans`).

The two hypotheses do exactly one job each, and neither implies the other.

`EpsilonEridani.IsCostLiminfStable` is what makes the limiting value a *lower* bound: it says that along
any finer filter, a weakly convergent family of feasible plans cannot lose cost in the limit. It
holds for free when the limiting cost is lower semicontinuous and is dominated by the family
(`EpsilonEridani.isCostLiminfStable_of_le`), which covers the fixed-cost problem where only the marginals
move.

`EpsilonEridani.HasRecoveryPlans` is what makes the limiting value an *upper* bound: every plan of the
limiting problem must be reachable, asymptotically and in cost, by feasible plans of the moving
problems. It is a genuine assumption — for a fixed lower semicontinuous cost and weakly converging
marginals the optimal values can strictly drop in the limit: take `c` to be the indicator of the
off-diagonal of `ℝ × ℝ`, which is lower semicontinuous, `μs n = δ (1 / (n + 1))` and `νs n = δ 0`;
every moving problem then has value `1`, while the limiting problem has value `0`. The recovery
family must converge weakly to the chosen limiting plan as well as satisfy the cost bound; this is
the recovery-coupling condition from the roadmap.

The two bounds are separated on purpose: `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_le_liminf_transportCost` needs the
liminf hypothesis and compactness, `EpsilonEridani.limsup_transportCost_le_transportCost` needs the
recovery hypothesis and nothing else, and only `EpsilonEridani.tendsto_transportCost` needs both.

Compactness enters through `EpsilonEridani.exists_isCoupling_tendsto_of_isTightMeasureSet`, proved in
`EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.OptimalTransport.Compactness`: a family of plans whose (varying) marginals
are tight on a filter tail is relatively compact, and every weak limit along a finer filter is a
coupling of the limiting marginals. This is the "tightness of optimizer subsequences" step, and it
is what lets the arguments run along a filter rather than a sequence: passing to a subsequence is
replaced by passing to a finer filter.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.IsCostLiminfStable` and `EpsilonEridani.HasRecoveryPlans` — the two stability hypotheses, with
  `EpsilonEridani.isCostLiminfStable_of_le` and `EpsilonEridani.isCostLiminfStable_const` supplying the first one
  from lower semicontinuity;
* `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_le_liminf_transportCost` and
  `EpsilonEridani.limsup_transportCost_le_transportCost` — the two one-sided bounds on the optimal values;
* `EpsilonEridani.hasRecoveryPlans_of_limsup_le` — the recovery hypothesis for a family with fixed
  marginals;
* `EpsilonEridani.tendsto_transportCost` — convergence of the optimal values, with
  `EpsilonEridani.tendsto_transportCost_of_const_marginals` as a topology-free fixed-marginal criterion;
* `EpsilonEridani.isOptimalCoupling_of_tendsto` and `EpsilonEridani.exists_isOptimalCoupling_tendsto` —
  subsequential convergence of optimal plans to an optimal plan of the limiting problem;
* `EpsilonEridani.tendsto_transportCost_of_polishSpace` and
  `EpsilonEridani.exists_isOptimalCoupling_tendsto_of_polishSpace` — the Polish sequential forms, where
  weak convergence supplies tightness and the stability theorems need no tightness hypothesis;
* `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_le_liminf_transportCost_of_lowerSemicontinuous` — the fixed-cost
  corollary: on Polish spaces the optimal transport cost of a lower semicontinuous cost is weakly
  lower semicontinuous in the pair of marginals, with `EpsilonEridani.lowerSemicontinuous_transportCost`
  its topological form on `ProbabilityMeasure X × ProbabilityMeasure Y`.

/-! Lower semicontinuity of the limiting cost, together with domination by the family, is the
standard source of `EpsilonEridani.IsCostLiminfStable`. Only a compatible pseudometric and measurable
opens on the product are needed for the weak-topology lower semicontinuity of
`EpsilonEridani.lowerSemicontinuous_lintegral_probabilityMeasure`. -/

semicontinuity of `π ↦ ∫⁻ c ∂π` gives the inequality for the limiting cost itself, and eventual
domination `c ≤ cs i` upgrades it to the moving costs. The feasibility of the plans plays no role:
the bound holds for every weakly convergent family. -/

/-- **The optimal transport cost of a lower semicontinuous cost is weakly lower semicontinuous in
the marginals.** This is the fixed-cost corollary: the liminf hypothesis is automatic, so no
stability assumption survives. The reverse inequality genuinely fails without a recovery hypothesis
— the optimal value can drop in the limit — which is why only one bound is stated here. -/
