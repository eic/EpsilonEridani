# The Wasserstein spaces are Borel spaces

The finite-moment space `EpsilonEridani.WassersteinSpace p X` and the anchored components
`EpsilonEridani.WassersteinComponent p μ₀` carry two structures of different origin: the measurable
structure inherited from the Giry σ-algebra on `ProbabilityMeasure X`, and the topology of the
Wasserstein metric. This file proves that, over a Polish ground space and for a finite exponent
`1 ≤ p < ∞`, the first is the Borel σ-algebra of the second. Consequently the open sets of the
Wasserstein topology are measurable, and measures on the Wasserstein space — random laws, such as
the population laws on `P_p (P_p (X))` of Wasserstein barycentre problems — may be manipulated with
the topological and metric tools of a Borel space.

The comparison goes through the weak topology, which is coarser than the Wasserstein topology.

* Every Giry-measurable set is Wasserstein-Borel: the inclusion into `ProbabilityMeasure X` is
  continuous for the Wasserstein topology
  (`EpsilonEridani.WassersteinSpace.continuous_toProbabilityMeasure`), and weakly continuous maps are
  Giry measurable (`Continuous.measurable_probabilityMeasure`).
* Every Wasserstein-open set is Giry measurable: the space is separable
  (`EpsilonEridani.WassersteinSpace.separableSpace`), so every open set is a countable union of balls; a
  ball is a strict sublevel set of `μ ↦ W_p (μ, ν)`, which is lower semicontinuous for the weak
  topology (`EpsilonEridani.lowerSemicontinuous_wassersteinEDist_of_ne_top`). Hence the ball is Borel for
  the weak topology on the set of laws in question, and that set, being separable and
  pseudometrizable, carries the Giry σ-algebra as its weak Borel σ-algebra
  (`EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.borelSpace_subtype`).

Separability is the only property of the carrier that the argument uses. It holds for `P_p (X)`,
hence for every component anchored at a law of finite `p`-moment, which is isometric to it. The
exponent `p = ∞` is excluded: `P_∞ (X)` need not be separable.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.WassersteinSpace.borelSpace` — `P_p (X)` is a Borel space for `1 ≤ p < ∞`, with
  `EpsilonEridani.WassersteinSpace.instBorelSpace` its instance form;
* `EpsilonEridani.WassersteinComponent.borelSpace` — a separable anchored component is a Borel space, with
  `EpsilonEridani.WassersteinComponent.instBorelSpace` its instance form.
