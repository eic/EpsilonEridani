# The infimal `c`-transform in the compact lower semicontinuous regime

`EpsilonEridani.cTransform c φ y = ⨅ x, (c (x, y) - φ x)` is an infimum over the source, so its
regularity in `y` splits into two halves needing opposite hypotheses. An infimum of upper
semicontinuous functions is upper semicontinuous with no hypothesis on the source at all, which is
`EpsilonEridani.upperSemicontinuous_cTransform`. The reverse half fails in general and needs the source to
be compact: this file proves that on a compact source a lower semicontinuous integrand makes the
transform lower semicontinuous, that the defining infimum is then attained, and hence that a
continuous cost and a continuous real-valued potential give a continuous transform. With a lower
semicontinuous cost section and an upper semicontinuous real-valued potential, attainment in turn
makes the transform real-valued and the `c`-superdifferential meet every vertical fibre. Borel
measurability of the transform is recorded as a corollary. The
measurability corollaries of the opposite, upper semicontinuous regime need no compactness and
live with that regime in `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.OptimalTransport.CTransform.Basic`.

The integrand of the transform is `x ↦ (c (x, y) : EReal) - φ x`, and the hypotheses below are
stated on it rather than on `c` and `φ` separately, since the extended-real subtraction is what a
lower bound has to survive. The `_coe` results specialize to a real-valued potential, where a lower
semicontinuous cost and an upper semicontinuous potential do supply that hypothesis; the pointwise
ones ask for lower semicontinuity of only the one section of the cost that their infimum ranges
over.

No metrizability, separability or countability of the source is assumed: attainment and lower
semicontinuity of a partial infimum need compactness alone, as
`EpsilonEridani.exists_iInf_eq_of_lowerSemicontinuous` and
`EpsilonEridani.lowerSemicontinuous_iInf_of_compactSpace` record.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_cTransform_eq`: on a nonempty compact source the infimum defining the transform
  is attained, and `EpsilonEridani.exists_cTransformSymm_eq` on a nonempty compact target.
* `EpsilonEridani.lowerSemicontinuous_cTransform`: on a compact source a jointly lower semicontinuous
  integrand makes the transform lower semicontinuous.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_cTransform_coe_eq_coe`, `EpsilonEridani.exists_cTransformSymm_coe_eq_coe`,
  `EpsilonEridani.cTransform_coe_ne_bot`, and `EpsilonEridani.cTransformSymm_coe_ne_bot`: on a nonempty compact
  factor, a lower semicontinuous cost section and an upper semicontinuous real-valued potential
  make the transform real-valued.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_mem_cSuperdifferential_coe` and
  `EpsilonEridani.exists_mem_cSuperdifferentialSymm_coe`: on a nonempty compact factor, a lower
  semicontinuous cost section and an upper semicontinuous real-valued potential supply a contact
  point in the corresponding fibre.
* `EpsilonEridani.continuous_cTransform_coe`: on a compact source a continuous cost and a continuous
  real-valued potential make the transform continuous.
* `EpsilonEridani.measurable_cTransform_of_lowerSemicontinuous` and
  `EpsilonEridani.measurable_cTransformSymm_of_lowerSemicontinuous`: Borel measurability of the transform
  in the compact lower semicontinuous regime.
