# The infimal `c`-transform, `c`-concavity, and contact sets

The Kantorovich dual constraint on a pair of potentials `φ : X → EReal` and `ψ : Y → EReal`
against a cost `c : X × Y → ℝ` is the pointwise inequality `φ x + ψ y ≤ c (x, y)`. With `φ`
fixed, the largest `ψ` satisfying it is the *infimal `c`-transform*
`cTransform c φ y = ⨅ x, (c (x, y) - φ x)`, and symmetrically with `ψ` fixed. This file builds
that transform, the two closure operations it generates, the `c`-concave potentials they fix,
and the contact set on which the dual constraint is an equality. It is the finite-real slice of
the roadmap's broader transform interface; the analytic-sublevel interface lives in
`EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.OptimalTransport.CTransform.Analytic`, and the compact attainment and
lower-semicontinuity interface in `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.OptimalTransport.CTransform.Compact`.
The extended-cost interface is a follow-up slice. The elementary
upper-semicontinuity result for infimal transforms, the Borel measurability it gives with no
hypothesis on the opposite factor, and a metric continuity result for real-valued transforms are
included here.

Even for a finite real cost and a finite real potential the infimum defining the transform can
be `-∞`, so the transform must have an extended-real codomain; and once the codomain is
extended, iterating the transform forces extended-real potentials. The cost is therefore taken
finite here, and that is exactly what makes the subtraction safe: `(c (x, y) : EReal) - φ x`
subtracts an arbitrary extended real from a real one, so it is never of the form `∞ - ∞`, and no
statement below hides such a term. Concretely, Mathlib's `EReal.le_sub_iff_add_le` applies with
no side condition, which gives the adjunction `ψ ≤ cTransform c φ ↔ φ ≤ cTransformSymm c ψ`
recorded as `EpsilonEridani.cTransform_galoisConnection`. For an extended-valued cost the same formula
is *not* the right one: with `c ≡ ⊤` and `φ ≡ 0`, `EReal` subtraction gives `⊤ - ⊤ = ⊥`, so the
double transform of `φ` is `⊥` on nonempty factors and the inequality `φ ≤ φᶜᶜ` fails. The
extended-cost interface needs its own conventions and is not built here.

Apart from the upper-semicontinuity and Borel measurability results, and the metric continuity
result on pseudometric spaces, the two factors are bare types and the results are
order-theoretic identities about the transform. They are the algebraic and topological halves of
the Kantorovich dual problem, to be combined with the integrability conditions that make the two
marginal integrals of a dual pair meaningful.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.cTransform c φ` — the infimal `c`-transform `y ↦ ⨅ x, (c (x, y) - φ x)` of a
  potential on the source, and `EpsilonEridani.cTransformSymm c ψ`, the symmetric transform
  `x ↦ ⨅ y, (c (x, y) - ψ y)` of a potential on the target;
* `EpsilonEridani.IsCConcave c φ` and `EpsilonEridani.IsCConcaveSymm c ψ` — the potentials that arise as a
  transform, equivalently those fixed by the corresponding double transform;
* `EpsilonEridani.contactSet c φ ψ` — the set where the dual constraint holds with equality, and
  `EpsilonEridani.cSuperdifferential c φ`, its instance at the canonical partner `cTransform c φ`.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.add_cTransform_le` — the transform is dual feasible against its own source potential,
  and `EpsilonEridani.le_cTransform_iff` — it is the largest such partner; together these give
  `EpsilonEridani.cTransform_galoisConnection`, the antitone Galois connection between the potentials
  on the two factors, and with it the order reversal `EpsilonEridani.cTransform_antitone`;
* `EpsilonEridani.le_cTransformSymm_cTransform` — a potential is dominated by its double transform, so
  transforming a dual feasible pair improves it, and
  `EpsilonEridani.cTransform_cTransformSymm_cTransform` — a transform is unchanged by a further double
  transform;
* `EpsilonEridani.isCConcave_iff` — `c`-concavity is exactly being fixed by the double transform;
* `EpsilonEridani.upperSemicontinuous_cTransform` — an infimal transform of upper-semicontinuous
  sections is upper semicontinuous, and `EpsilonEridani.measurable_cTransform_of_upperSemicontinuous` —
  it is then Borel measurable, while `EpsilonEridani.uniformContinuous_iInf_sub` shows that a
  real-valued infimal transform is uniformly continuous when the target-variable sections of the
  cost share a uniform modulus and its infima are finite;
* `EpsilonEridani.cTransform_add_const` — the transform turns an additive real constant into its
  negative, which is the normalisation freedom of the dual problem;
* `EpsilonEridani.cTransform_coe` and `EpsilonEridani.cTransformSymm_coe` — the extended-real transforms of
  coerced real potentials agree with the corresponding real infima whenever those infima are
  bounded below;
* `EpsilonEridani.contactSet_subset_contactSet_cTransformSymm_cTransform` — sequentially transforming a
  feasible pair gives a dominating feasible pair with a larger contact set, and
  `EpsilonEridani.cTransformSymm_cTransform_eq_of_mem_cSuperdifferential` — a potential agrees with its
  double transform at every point of its `c`-superdifferential.

This is the finite-real algebraic slice of Layer 2, item 2 of the optimal-transport roadmap.
