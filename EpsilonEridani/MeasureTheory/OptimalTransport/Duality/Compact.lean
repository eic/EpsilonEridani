# Strong Kantorovich duality for continuous costs on compact spaces

For probability measures `μ` and `ν` on two compact pseudometric spaces whose open sets are
measurable, and a continuous nonnegative cost `c` on their product, the transport problem and its
dual have the same value:

`(transportCost (ENNReal.ofReal ∘ c) μ ν).toReal =
  sSup {kantorovichDualValue μ ν φ ψ}`,

the supremum running over the pairs of *continuous* potentials with `φ x + ψ y ≤ c (x, y)`. Weak
duality, proved for the general interface in `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.OptimalTransport.Duality.Basic`,
gives one inequality; this file supplies the other one and hence closes the gap.

The proof is the finite approximation argument. Uniform continuity of `c` turns a `δ`-net of each
factor into a pair of measurable maps `qX : X → Fin n` and `qY : Y → Fin m` moving no point by
more than `δ`; pushing the two marginals forward along them produces a finite transport problem
whose cost matrix is the cost read at the marked points. Kantorovich duality on finite spaces,
already available as `EpsilonEridani.exists_cost_eq_finiteDualValue`, solves that problem exactly. Its
optimal transportation matrix is lifted back to a genuine coupling by gluing the conditional
measures on the fibres, which bounds the continuous primal value from above; its optimal
potentials are read back as step functions on the fibres, which bounds the continuous dual value
from below. Both estimates lose only a multiple of the modulus of continuity, so letting the net
refine closes the duality gap.

The smoothing result `EpsilonEridani.exists_continuous_feasible_pair_dominating` replaces any feasible pair
by a *continuous* one that dominates it pointwise: applying the infimal
`c`-transform twice inherits the modulus of continuity of the cost. This is what upgrades the
step-function potentials produced by the finite problem to the continuous potentials the theorem
advertises, and it is also why the bounded-continuous and the integrable dual classes have the same
supremum. The discretisation lemma `EpsilonEridani.exists_measurable_dist_lt` is imported from
`EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.MeasurableSpace.Metric`; it applies to totally bounded pseudometric spaces,
and is used here through `isCompact_univ.totallyBounded`.

## Implementation notes

The transform is spelled here as the real infimum `⨅ x, (c (x, y) - φ x)` rather than through the
`EReal`-valued `EpsilonEridani.cTransform`, because the relevant infima are bounded below and the whole
computation stays inside `ℝ`. The bridge lemmas `EpsilonEridani.cTransform_coe` and
`EpsilonEridani.cTransformSymm_coe` identify these real infima with the extended-real transforms, so the
proof reuses the order-theoretic transform API from
`EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.OptimalTransport.CTransform.Basic`.

The cost is taken nonnegative because `EpsilonEridani.transportCost` measures an `ℝ≥0∞`-valued cost. A
continuous cost on a compact space is bounded below, so this costs no generality beyond an
additive normalisation of the cost and of the potentials.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_continuous_feasible_pair_dominating` — a feasible pair is dominated by a
  continuous feasible pair;
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_continuous_forall_add_le_transportCost_le` — the approximate duality: for every
  `ε > 0` there is a continuous feasible pair whose value is within `ε` of the primal value;
* `EpsilonEridani.isLUB_kantorovichDualValue_continuous` — **strong Kantorovich duality**: the primal
  value is the least upper bound of the values of the continuous feasible pairs;
* `EpsilonEridani.isLUB_kantorovichDualValue_integrable` — the same value is also the least upper bound
  over the larger integrable dual class, so the two classes agree;
* `EpsilonEridani.toReal_transportCost_eq_sSup` and `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_eq_ofReal_sSup` — the same
  statement read as an equality of a supremum, in `ℝ` and in `ℝ≥0∞`;
* `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_ne_top_of_continuous` — the primal value is finite. Real-form weak
  duality is provided by `EpsilonEridani.DualFeasible.kantorovichDualValue_le_toReal_transportCost`.
