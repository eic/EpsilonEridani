# Complementary slackness, optimality certificates, and `c`-cyclical monotonicity

A pair of integrable potentials `φ`, `ψ` satisfying the Kantorovich dual constraint
`φ x + ψ y ≤ c (x, y)` bounds the cost of every transport plan from below. When a plan is
concentrated on the *contact set* where that constraint is an equality, the two bounds meet:
the plan is optimal, the pair is a dual optimizer, and there is no duality gap. This is
complementary slackness, and the resulting data is the standard optimality certificate that the
Monge and barycentre layers verify instead of re-solving a transport problem.

This file builds that certificate for the raw extended-nonnegative interface — an arbitrary cost
`c : X × Y → ℝ≥0∞` on arbitrary measurable spaces — and shows that it is exact: in the
dual-attainment regime, an optimal plan of almost-everywhere measurable cost is concentrated on
the contact set. Measurability of the cost is needed for that converse only, and never for the
consequences drawn from a certificate. No topology,
compactness, or lower semicontinuity is used, so the certificate applies verbatim to the
Borel-cost regime, where a dual optimizer is produced by other means. It is a statement
about the *unregularized* Kantorovich problem only: an entropy-regularized optimizer is
characterised by the stationarity condition `dπ / d(μ ⊗ ν) = exp ((φ ⊕ ψ - c) / ε)` and is
typically of full support, so it is not concentrated on a contact set and no claim is made
about it here.

The last section connects the cost-level notion of `c`-cyclical monotonicity to certificates by
proving that the contact set of a dual feasible pair is `c`-cyclically monotone. Hence a
certified plan is concentrated on a `c`-cyclically monotone set, which is measurable as soon as
the cost and both potentials are. The converse implication — that
concentration on a `c`-cyclically monotone set forces optimality — is the
Schachermayer--Teichmann theorem and is not proved here.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.dualContactSet c φ ψ` — the set where the dual constraint for an
  extended-nonnegative cost holds with equality;
* `EpsilonEridani.IsDualCertificate c π μ ν φ ψ` — a coupling `π` together with an integrable dual
  feasible pair `(φ, ψ)` on whose contact set `π` is concentrated;
* `EpsilonEridani.IsCyclicallyMonotone c S` — finite `c`-cyclical monotonicity of a set of pairs.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.IsDualCertificate.lintegral_eq_ofReal` — a certified plan costs exactly the value of
  its dual pair, with `EpsilonEridani.IsDualCertificate.transportCost_eq` the resulting absence of a
  duality gap;
* `EpsilonEridani.IsDualCertificate.isOptimalCoupling` and
  `EpsilonEridani.IsDualCertificate.kantorovichDualValue_le` — a certificate proves primal optimality
  of the plan and dual optimality of the pair;
* `EpsilonEridani.isDualCertificate_iff` — **complementary slackness**: for a fixed coupling `π` and a
  fixed feasible integrable pair, being a certificate is exactly having finite cost no larger
  than the dual value, provided `AEMeasurable c π`; so `EpsilonEridani.IsOptimalCoupling.isDualCertificate`
  recovers the certificate from an optimal plan of almost-everywhere measurable cost whenever
  the dual value is attained;
* `EpsilonEridani.isDualCertificate_graphPlan` and
  `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_eq_lintegral_of_ae_mem_dualContactSet` — the Monge form: the
  Kantorovich value is attained at the graph plan of a map whose graph lies almost everywhere in
  the contact set; together with `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_le_lintegral_of_hasLaw`, this exhibits
  the map as a minimizer among transport maps;
* `EpsilonEridani.DualFeasible.isCyclicallyMonotone_dualContactSet` and
  `EpsilonEridani.IsDualCertificate.exists_isCyclicallyMonotone` — contact sets are `c`-cyclically
  monotone, and a certified plan whose cost and potentials are measurable is concentrated on a
  measurable such set.

## Implementation notes

`EpsilonEridani.contactSet` is stated for a *finite real* cost and extended-real potentials, the
signature forced by the `c`-transform calculus, where a transform of a real potential can take
the value `-∞`. The primal problem instead uses an extended-nonnegative cost, so a plan can be
forbidden to charge a pair by setting `c` to `∞` there, while the potentials appearing in an
integrable dual pair are honestly real. `EpsilonEridani.dualContactSet` is the contact set for that
second signature, and `EpsilonEridani.dualContactSet_ofReal` identifies the two whenever both apply.
Membership is an equality of `EReal`s rather than of extended-nonnegative numbers, because
`ENNReal.ofReal` forgets the sign: for `c (x, y) = 0` and `φ x + ψ y = -1` the two
`ENNReal.ofReal` values agree although the dual constraint is strict.

The complementary slackness converse is stated with the real number `(∫⁻ z, c z ∂π).toReal`
rather than with `ENNReal.ofReal (kantorovichDualValue μ ν φ ψ)` on purpose: a dual feasible
pair can have a negative value, and then `ENNReal.ofReal` truncates it to `0` and the
`ℝ≥0∞`-valued inequality holds for reasons that have nothing to do with contact. The example
above, with both spaces a point, is such a pair.

/-- **The contact set of a dual feasible pair is `c`-cyclically monotone.** Rearranging the
targets replaces each equality `φ (x i) + ψ (y i) = c (x i, y i)` by an inequality, while the
two total sums of potentials agree because a permutation does not change a finite sum. -/

/-- **A certified plan with measurable cost and potentials is concentrated on a measurable
`c`-cyclically monotone set.** The converse implication, that concentration on a
`c`-cyclically monotone set forces optimality, is the Schachermayer--Teichmann theorem and needs
topological hypotheses. -/
