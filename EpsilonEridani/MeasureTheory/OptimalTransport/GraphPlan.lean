# Graph plans: the transport plan induced by a transport map

A *transport map* from `μ` to `ν` is a map `T : X → Y` that pushes `μ` forward to `ν`. Mathlib
already has the predicate for this, `ProbabilityTheory.HasLaw T ν μ`, which asks for
`μ`-almost-everywhere measurability of `T` together with `μ.map T = ν`; this file adds no second
predicate. What it adds is the optimal-transport interface around it: the *graph plan*
`EpsilonEridani.graphPlan T μ`, the pushforward of `μ` along `x ↦ (x, T x)`, which is the transport
plan that moves all the mass sitting at `x` to the single point `T x`.

Two facts organise the file. First, `EpsilonEridani.isCoupling_graphPlan_iff`: for an
almost-everywhere measurable `T`, the graph plan couples `μ` and `ν` exactly when `T` is a
transport map from `μ` to `ν`. This is the passage from the Monge problem to the Kantorovich
problem, whose effect on values is the change of variables `EpsilonEridani.lintegral_graphPlan`; the
resulting inequality of transport costs belongs to the cost theory and is stated in
`EpsilonEridani/MeasureTheory/OptimalTransport/Cost/Basic.lean`. Second, `EpsilonEridani.eq_graphPlan_iff`: a plan
is a graph plan exactly when it is *deterministic*, that is, concentrated on the graph of `T`.
With `EpsilonEridani.graphPlan_eq_graphPlan_iff`, which says that the map is determined `μ`-almost
everywhere by its graph plan, this makes the graph construction a bijection between transport
maps modulo `μ`-a.e. equality and deterministic plans.

Nothing here needs a topology, a metric or a normalisation, and the two factors are arbitrary
measurable spaces. The determinism statements do ask that the diagonal of `Y × Y` be
measurable, `MeasurableEq Y`, because "`π` is carried by the graph of `T`" is otherwise not a
statement about a measurable set. That hypothesis holds for every standard Borel space, every
second-countable Hausdorff space with measurable open sets and every countable measurable space
with measurable singletons.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.graphPlan T μ` — the graph plan, or Monge plan, of `T`: the pushforward of `μ` along
  `x ↦ (x, T x)`;
* `EpsilonEridani.Coupling.graph` — the graph plan of a transport map between two probability
  measures, bundled as an element of `EpsilonEridani.Coupling`.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.fst_graphPlan` and `EpsilonEridani.snd_graphPlan` — when `T` is `μ`-a.e. measurable, the two
  marginals of its graph plan are `μ` and `μ.map T`;
* `EpsilonEridani.isCoupling_graphPlan_iff` — the graph plan of an a.e. measurable `T` couples `μ` and
  `ν` exactly when `ProbabilityTheory.HasLaw T ν μ`;
* `EpsilonEridani.lintegral_graphPlan` — the change of variables
  `∫⁻ z, c z ∂graphPlan T μ = ∫⁻ x, c (x, T x) ∂μ`, which feeds the Monge-to-Kantorovich
  inequality `EpsilonEridani.transportCost_le_lintegral_of_hasLaw` in
  `EpsilonEridani/MeasureTheory/OptimalTransport/Cost/Basic.lean`;
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_graphPlan_iff` — a plan is the graph plan of `T` exactly when it is concentrated
  on the graph of `T`, with `EpsilonEridani.graphPlan_eq_graphPlan_iff` the uniqueness of the map that
  induces a given deterministic plan;
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_dirac_of_hasLaw_dirac` — a transport map out of a Dirac measure forces the target
  to be a Dirac measure, so the unique plan out of an atom is deterministic only in that case.

## Implementation notes

`EpsilonEridani.graphPlan` records the map in the *second* coordinate, matching the plan-first
convention of `EpsilonEridani.IsCoupling π μ ν`, in which the source is the first factor. The opposite
convention is available as `EpsilonEridani.map_swap_graphPlan`, which identifies the coordinate swap
of a graph plan with the pushforward along `x ↦ (T x, x)`.

Measurability hypotheses are `AEMeasurable` rather than `Measurable` throughout, because that
is what `ProbabilityTheory.HasLaw` supplies and what the pushforward really uses. Both marginal
formulas need `T` to be a.e. measurable: `Measure.map` sends a function that is not a.e.
measurable to a junk Dirac mass, which neither marginal formula survives.

This module needs nothing from the transport cost, so it sits below it: the Monge-to-Kantorovich
relaxation inequality of Layer 4, item 1, which the change of variables here supplies, is stated
with the cost itself in `EpsilonEridani/MeasureTheory/OptimalTransport/Cost/Basic.lean`.

This is Layer 0, item 2 of the optimal-transport roadmap.
