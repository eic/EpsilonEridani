# Approximation of product-space events by measurable cylinders

Under a finite measure on a product space `∀ i, α i`, every measurable event is approximated in
measure by a measurable cylinder over finitely many coordinates. This is Mathlib's density theorem
for a generating set ring, `exists_measure_symmDiff_lt_of_generateFrom_isSetRing`, applied to the
ring of measurable cylinders, which generates the product σ-algebra.
