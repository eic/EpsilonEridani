# Fundamental domains of properly discontinuous actions

Let a countable group `G` act properly discontinuously on a second countable, locally compact
Hausdorff space `X`. Every point with trivial stabilizer has a neighbourhood disjoint from all
of its nontrivial translates. Enumerating the basic open sets with this property as
`V₀, V₁, …` and keeping, from each `Vₙ`, the points whose orbit misses `V₀, …, Vₙ₋₁`, gives a
Borel set `s` that meets every orbit of a free point exactly once, and meets no orbit twice.

Consequently, for any measure `μ` on `X` for which the non-free points form a null set, `s` is
a measurable fundamental domain for `G` in the sense of `MeasureTheory.IsFundamentalDomain`
(`MeasureTheory.Measure.exists_isFundamentalDomain_of_properlyDiscontinuousSMul`). Its translates
are not merely almost everywhere disjoint but genuinely disjoint. Together with
`MeasureTheory.IsFundamentalDomain.measure_eq` this makes the covolume
`MeasureTheory.covolume G X μ` the measure of any measurable fundamental domain.
