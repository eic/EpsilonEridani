# Measure theory on the multiplicative type tag

`Multiplicative α` is the type `α` with its addition renamed to multiplication. Mathlib transports
the algebraic and topological structure of `α` along that renaming, but not the measurable
structure, so an additive group carrying a Haar measure is not usable as a *multiplicative* group
with a Haar measure. This file supplies the missing transport: the measurable space, the Borel
property, the three measure-theoretic size conditions, and left invariance, from which the
`IsHaarMeasure` instance follows.

Everything here is definitional — `Multiplicative α` and `α` are the same type, with the same
topology and the same σ-algebra — so each instance is the corresponding instance on `α`, and
`Measure.IsMulLeftInvariant` is `Measure.IsAddLeftInvariant` read through
`Multiplicative.toAdd`. What the instances add is that typeclass search can find them: a class
whose argument is the *type* `Multiplicative α` (`MeasurableSpace`, `BorelSpace`,
`IsMulLeftInvariant`) is keyed on that head symbol and no instance for `α` will match, and even a
class whose only argument is the measure (`IsProbabilityMeasure`,
`IsFiniteMeasureOnCompacts`, `IsOpenPosMeasure`) is stated with the ambient type fixed by the
measure's spelling, so it must be restated once the measure is read as a measure on
`Multiplicative α`.

Only the `Multiplicative` direction is built, because that is the direction a consumer needs: the
representation theory of a group is stated for a multiplicative group, while Mathlib's circle,
`AddCircle T`, is additive. The `Additive` analogues are the same one-line transports and are
omitted until something asks for them.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.instMeasurableSpaceMultiplicative`: the σ-algebra of `Multiplicative α` is that of `α`.
* `EpsilonEridani.instIsMulLeftInvariantMultiplicative`: a left-invariant measure for the addition of `α`
  is left invariant for the multiplication of `Multiplicative α`.
* `EpsilonEridani.instIsHaarMeasureMultiplicative`: an additive Haar measure on `α` is a Haar measure on
  `Multiplicative α`.
