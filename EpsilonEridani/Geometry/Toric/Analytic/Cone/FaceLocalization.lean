# Face localizations of affine complex points

A face `τ` of a cone `σ` has the larger dual semigroup, so a complex point of the affine chart of
`τ` restricts to a complex point of the affine chart of `σ`. This restriction
`EpsilonEridani.Toric.faceAffinePointMap` is the map on complex points induced by the algebraic face
restriction `EpsilonEridani.Toric.faceAffineCoordinateRingMap`; it is functorial in face inclusions and
equivariant for the coordinate-free complex torus.

When `σ` is finitely generated and `τ = σ ⊓ ker m` is cut out by a character `m` of the dual
semigroup of `σ`, the coordinate ring of `τ` is the localization of that of `σ` away from the
monomial of `m`. On complex points this becomes the analytic statement that the face map is an
open embedding onto the locus where the monomial of `m` does not vanish: a point of `τ` is
recovered from its restriction because every character nonnegative on `τ` becomes nonnegative on
`σ` after adding a multiple of `m`, and the monomial of `m` is invertible on `τ`. The topologies
are the monomial-embedding topologies of arbitrary finite generating families, so the statement
involves no choice of coordinates.

Every face of a regular cone is cut out in this way. For a regular cone the image of the face map
is therefore described intrinsically, as the locus where every monomial of a character vanishing
on the face is nonzero, and the image of the intersection of two faces is the intersection of
their images. These open embeddings and their overlaps are the topological input for gluing the
affine charts of a fan.

The same recovery formula makes the face map holomorphic in both directions. Give the charts of
`σ` and of `τ` the complex structures of extending bases. Every monomial of `σ` pulls back to a
monomial of `τ`, so the face map is holomorphic. Conversely, every monomial of `τ` is a quotient
of two monomials of `σ` whose denominator does not vanish on the image. Hence a map into the chart
of `τ` is holomorphic exactly when its composite with the face map is. For a regular cone the face
map is therefore a holomorphic local diffeomorphism, and with the open embedding property it
identifies the chart of the face biholomorphically with an open subset of the chart of `σ`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Toric.faceAffinePointMap`: restriction of complex points along a face inclusion, with
  `EpsilonEridani.Toric.faceAffinePointMap_eq_comp` identifying it with the complex points of the
  algebraic face restriction, and `EpsilonEridani.Toric.faceAffinePointMap_id`,
  `EpsilonEridani.Toric.faceAffinePointMap_comp` and `EpsilonEridani.Toric.faceAffinePointMap_smul` its
  functoriality and torus equivariance.
* `EpsilonEridani.Toric.continuous_faceAffinePointMap`: the face map is continuous.
* `EpsilonEridani.Toric.faceAffinePointMap_apply_single_ne_zero`: a restricted point does not vanish on
  the monomial of a character vanishing on the face.

  `EpsilonEridani.Toric.range_faceAffinePointMap_of_inf_ker_eq` and

  character `m` of a finitely generated cone, the face map is an open embedding onto the locus
  where the monomial of `m` does not vanish.
* `EpsilonEridani.Toric.IsRegularCone.range_faceAffinePointMap`,
  `EpsilonEridani.Toric.IsRegularCone.isOpenEmbedding_faceAffinePointMap` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Toric.IsRegularCone.range_faceAffinePointMap_inf`: the same for every face of a regular
  cone, with an intrinsic description of the image and its behaviour on intersections of faces.
* `EpsilonEridani.Toric.contMDiff_faceAffinePointMap`: the face map is holomorphic for the complex
  structures of regular cone coordinates.
* `EpsilonEridani.Toric.contMDiffOn_faceAffinePointMap_comp_iff_of_inf_ker_eq` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Toric.IsRegularCone.contMDiffOn_faceAffinePointMap_comp_iff`: a map into the chart of
  the face is holomorphic exactly when its composite with the face map is.

  face chart onto the open range of its localization map.
