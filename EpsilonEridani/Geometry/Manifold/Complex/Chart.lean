# Chart transitions of a complex curve are analytic

On a one-dimensional complex manifold, a manifold charted by `ℂ` whose transition maps are
complex differentiable, the transition maps are in fact analytic: a complex differentiable function
of one complex variable on an open set is analytic there, by the Cauchy integral formula. This is
the form in which the holomorphy of the atlas of a Riemann surface enters constructions on it,
such as the elementary symmetric atlas of its symmetric powers.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.analyticAt_chartAt_comp_chartAt_symm`: on a complex curve, the transition between the
  charts at two points is analytic at the coordinates of every point of both chart sources.
