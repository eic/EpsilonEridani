# Smooth translations and diffeomorphisms from group actions

This file packages the action of an element of a group with a `ContMDiffConstSMul` instance as a
self-diffeomorphism. Unlike `Diffeomorph.smul`, this construction does not require a manifold
structure on the acting group or joint smoothness of the action. Smooth multiplication supplies
the required smoothness of individual left translations via a self-action instance, as does
smooth addition for additive translations.

## Main declarations

* `ContMDiffMul.contMDiffConstSMul`: smooth multiplication gives smooth left translations.
* `Diffeomorph.constSmul`: the diffeomorphism given by a fixed element of a pointwise-smooth
  group action.
