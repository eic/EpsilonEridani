# Diffeomorphism actions and smooth ambient isotopy

This file connects composition of bundled smooth embeddings with diffeomorphisms to smooth ambient
isotopy. Transport by the final map of a diffeotopy is smoothly ambient isotopic to the original
embedding, while reparametrising two smoothly ambient-isotopic embeddings by the same source
diffeomorphism preserves the relation.

Both statements are the specializations to bundled embeddings, and to a diffeomorphism, of
`EpsilonEridani.SmoothAmbientIsotopic.final_comp` and `EpsilonEridani.SmoothAmbientIsotopic.precomp`, which hold
for arbitrary bundled smooth maps; only the identification of the composite with the corresponding
reindexing operation is done here.

These are the compatibility results needed by Layer 4 of the GeometricTopology roadmap, in the
milestone “equivalence in each presentation.”

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.SmoothEmbedding.smoothAmbientIsotopic_transDiffeomorph_final`: transport along the final
  map of a diffeotopy is a smooth ambient isotopy.
* `EpsilonEridani.SmoothEmbedding.SmoothAmbientIsotopic.compDiffeomorph`: reparametrisation preserves
  smooth ambient isotopy.

/-- **Transport along a diffeotopy is an ambient isotopy.** An embedding and its transport by the
time-one map of a diffeotopy of the ambient manifold are smoothly ambient isotopic: the diffeotopy
itself is the witness. So the ambient `Diff`-action of `EpsilonEridani.SmoothEmbedding.instMulActionDiff`
preserves the equivalence class of an embedding whenever the acting diffeomorphism is diffeotopic
to the identity — for knot presentations, that is exactly ambient isotopy of knots. -/
