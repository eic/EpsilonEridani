# Extended manifold charts as measurable embeddings

Mathlib's extended chart at a point is a `PartialEquiv` between a manifold and its model vector
space. Its restrictions to the chart source and target are mutually continuous, hence the chart
restricted to its source is a measurable embedding for Borel measurable spaces. This is the
form used to transport measures between a manifold and coordinates.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.measurableEmbedding_extChartAt_restrict`: an extended chart restricted to its source is
  a measurable embedding.
* `EpsilonEridani.MeasurableSet.image_extChartAt`: the image of a measurable subset of a chart source is
  measurable in the model space.
