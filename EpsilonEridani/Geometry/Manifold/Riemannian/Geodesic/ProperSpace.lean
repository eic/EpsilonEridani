# Properness from an everywhere-defined minimizing exponential map

The Riemannian distance from `p` to `exp_p v` is at most `‖v‖` (`dist_riemannianExp_le`), so
`exp_p` maps the closed ball of radius `r` in `T_p M` into the closed ball of radius `r` about `p`.
Suppose in addition that every point `q` of the latter ball is reached from `p` by a *minimizing*
initial velocity, one with `exp_p v = q` and `‖v‖ ≤ dist p q` (equality then follows from the
distance bound).  The closed ball of radius `r` about `p` is then exactly the image under `exp_p`
of the closed ball of radius `r` in `T_p M`.  When moreover `exp_p` is defined on all of `T_p M`,
it is continuous there, so each closed ball about `p` is the continuous image of a compact ball of
the finite-dimensional tangent space and is compact; the closed balls about other points are closed
subsets of these, and the manifold is a proper metric space.

This is the step from assertions (a) and (f) to assertion (b) of do Carmo's Hopf–Rinow theorem,
in a Riemannian manifold whose ambient distance is the Riemannian one.  Existence of minimizing
initial velocities is a hypothesis of these results, not a consequence of the distance bound, and
properness does not follow from it alone: continuity of `exp_p` on the whole tangent space, that
is assertion (a), is what makes the closed balls compact.  Metric completeness then follows from
Mathlib's `complete_of_proper`.

## Main results

In the namespace `EpsilonEridani.Manifold`:

* `image_riemannianExp_closedBall_subset`: `exp_p` maps the closed tangent ball of radius `r` into
  the closed ball of radius `r` about `p`.
* `closedBall_eq_image_riemannianExp`: with minimizing initial velocities, the closed ball of
  radius `r` about `p` is the image of the closed tangent ball of radius `r`.
* `isCompact_closedBall_of_expDomain_eq_univ_of_exists_riemannianExp_eq_and_norm_le_dist`: it is
  compact when moreover `exp_p` is everywhere defined.
* `properSpace_of_expDomain_eq_univ_of_exists_riemannianExp_eq_and_norm_le_dist`: **an
  everywhere-defined exponential map with minimizing initial velocities makes the manifold
  proper.**

/-! ### Closed balls as images of tangent balls

The results with a minimizing hypothesis assume that every point `q` of the closed ball of radius
`r` about `p` is reached from `p` by a *minimizing initial velocity*: a tangent vector `v` with
`exp_p v = q` and `‖v‖ ≤ dist p q`, so that `‖v‖ = dist p q` by `dist_riemannianExp_le`.  This is
assertion (f) of the Hopf–Rinow theorem at the base point `p`, read on the initial velocities of
the minimizing geodesics. -/

radius `r` about the base point. -/
