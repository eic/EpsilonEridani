# Piecewise smooth Riemannian paths

This file extends the metric-independent piecewise smooth path API with Riemannian length results.
It proves that the sum of `Manifold.pathELength` over any ordered partition is the length on the
whole interval. Consequently the sum used to compute the length of a piecewise-`C¹` path is
independent of its witnessing partition and, more generally, of every refinement.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Manifold.sum_pathELength_eq`: summing `Manifold.pathELength` over an ordered partition
  gives the length on the whole interval.
* `EpsilonEridani.Manifold.sum_pathELength_eq_of_endpoints_eq`: two ordered partitions with the same
  endpoints compute the same length.
* `EpsilonEridani.Manifold.IsPiecewiseContMDiffOn.exists_partition_sum_pathELength_eq`: a piecewise
  smooth path has a witnessing partition whose piece lengths sum to its `pathELength`.

This is the finite-partition part of Layer 0 of the Hopf--Rinow roadmap. It uses Mathlib's
`Manifold.pathELength_add`; no separate notion of Riemannian length is introduced.

/-- **Path length is additive over every finite ordered partition.** The sum of the lengths of
the restrictions to consecutive pieces is the length over the interval between the first and last
partition points. No regularity hypothesis is needed: this is finite iteration of Mathlib's
`Manifold.pathELength_add`. -/

lengths. In particular, inserting any finite collection of refinement points leaves the computed
length unchanged. -/
