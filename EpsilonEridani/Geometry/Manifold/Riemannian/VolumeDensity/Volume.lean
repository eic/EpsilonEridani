# The Riemannian volume measure

A continuous Riemannian metric on a manifold `M` determines a measure on `M`: in each chart it is
coordinate Lebesgue measure weighted by the square root of the metric Gram determinant, the
local measure `EpsilonEridani.chartRiemannianVolume`. These local measures agree on chart overlaps, so
when countably many chart sources cover `M` (for instance when `M` is second countable, or
`σ`-compact) they glue to a unique measure on the Borel `σ`-algebra of `M`,
`EpsilonEridani.riemannianVolume I M`.

The construction needs no orientation and applies to manifolds with boundary or corners. The
Riemannian volume is locally finite, so it is a finite measure on a compact manifold; this is the
measure against which the total volume of a closed Riemannian manifold is taken.

The construction follows J. M. Lee, *Introduction to Riemannian Manifolds*, 2nd ed., Springer
GTM 176 (2018), Proposition 2.44 and the discussion of the Riemannian density following it.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.riemannianVolume`: the Riemannian volume measure of a manifold with a continuous
  Riemannian metric.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.riemannianVolume_restrict_source`: on the source of each preferred chart, the
  Riemannian volume is the chart volume.
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_riemannianVolume_iff`: this property characterizes the Riemannian volume.
* `EpsilonEridani.riemannianVolume_apply_of_subset`: the volume of a subset of a chart source is its
  chart volume.
* `EpsilonEridani.isLocallyFiniteMeasure_riemannianVolume`: the Riemannian volume is locally finite.
