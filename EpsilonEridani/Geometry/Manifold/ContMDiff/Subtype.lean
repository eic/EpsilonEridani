# Smoothness of maps into an open submanifold

A map into an open submanifold `U ⊆ M` is `C^n` exactly when its composition with the inclusion
`U → M` is `C^n`: the charts of `U` are restrictions of the charts of `M`, so smoothness is
insensitive to whether the codomain is read in the submanifold or in the ambient manifold.

Mathlib records this through `ContMDiffWithinAt.subtypeVal_comp_iff` within a set and through
`ContMDiffAt.subtypeVal_comp_iff` at a point, both at regularity `∞`. Since smoothness into a
manifold is a local invariant property at *every* regularity, the same characterizations hold for
arbitrary `n`; this file supplies them.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ContMDiffWithinAt.subtypeVal_comp_iff`, `EpsilonEridani.ContMDiffAt.subtypeVal_comp_iff`,
  `EpsilonEridani.ContMDiffOn.subtypeVal_comp_iff`, and `EpsilonEridani.ContMDiff.subtypeVal_comp_iff`: a map
  into an open submanifold is `C^n` (within a set, at a point, on a set, globally) iff its
  composition with the inclusion is.

## References

* Used to lift ambient curves (e.g. straight segments) to `C¹` curves in open submanifolds;
