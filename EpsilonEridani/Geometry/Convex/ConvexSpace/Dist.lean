# Weights of affine simplices in a standard simplex

A point `w` of a standard simplex on a finite type `N` is determined by its weight vector
`⇑w.weights : N → ℝ`, and Mathlib's topology on `StdSimplex ℝ N` is the one induced by this
embedding (`Convexity.StdSimplex.isEmbedding_toFun_comp_weights`). This file computes the weight
vectors of the points of the affine simplex `Convexity.StdSimplex.affineMapMk v` with vertices
`v m`:

* `Convexity.StdSimplex.weights_affineMapMk_subBarycenter`: the image of the barycenter of the
  face spanned by `S` has as weight vector the centroid of the weight vectors of the vertices
  `v m`, `m ∈ S`;
* `Convexity.StdSimplex.dist_weights_affineMapMk_le`: every point of the affine simplex lies in
  each closed ball, for the sup metric on weight vectors, containing all of its vertices.

These are the metric facts about affine simplices used to show that iterated barycentric
subdivision produces arbitrarily small simplices.
