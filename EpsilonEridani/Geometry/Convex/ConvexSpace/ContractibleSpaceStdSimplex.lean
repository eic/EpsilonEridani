# The standard simplex on a finite type is contractible

The straight-line homotopy towards a vertex contracts `StdSimplex ℝ M` for a finite nonempty `M`.
Contractibility upgrades the path-connectedness already recorded for the standard simplex to
simple connectedness, which is what makes transport of a local coefficient system along a path
inside a simplex independent of the path.

Finiteness of `M` is used through `StdSimplex.isEmbedding_toFun_comp_weights`: it is only for a
finite `M` that the topology of `StdSimplex ℝ M` is induced by the weights.

The continuity argument is adapted from Joël Riou's proof of
`Convexity.StdSimplex.continuous_convexCombPair` in
`Mathlib/Geometry/Convex/ConvexSpace/PathConnectedSpaceStdSimplex.lean`, which establishes
continuity in the time variable alone; the contraction needs joint continuity in time and in the
point of the simplex, which is where finiteness of `M` enters.
