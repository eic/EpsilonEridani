# A limit criterion for the Lie algebra of a closed subgroup

Let `K` be a closed subgroup of a finite-dimensional Lie group. Its Lie algebra consists exactly
of the limits `X` for which there are eventually positive real numbers `tₙ → 0` and derivations
`Xₙ → X` such that, eventually,

`lieExp (tₙ • Xₙ) ∈ K`.

This is the limit criterion used in the local-separation step of the closed-subgroup theorem. In
that application, a hypothetical sequence of nonzero transverse coordinates `Yₙ → 0` is written
as

`Yₙ = ‖Yₙ‖ • (‖Yₙ‖⁻¹ • Yₙ)`.

A convergent subsequence of the normalized directions therefore satisfies the criterion below,
forcing its limit into the subgroup Lie algebra and contradicting transversality.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Lie.mem_lieSubalgebraOfSubgroup_of_seq`: a convergent sequence of rescaled
  infinitesimal elements whose exponentials lie in a closed subgroup has its limit in the
  subgroup Lie algebra.
* `EpsilonEridani.Lie.mem_lieSubalgebraOfSubgroup_iff_exists_seq`: the resulting sequential
  characterization.

/-- A limit criterion for the Lie algebra of a closed subgroup. Suppose eventually positive scales
`tₙ` tend to zero, derivations `Xₙ` tend to `X`, and eventually `lieExp (tₙ • Xₙ)` lies in
`K`. Then `X` belongs to the Lie algebra of `K`. -/
