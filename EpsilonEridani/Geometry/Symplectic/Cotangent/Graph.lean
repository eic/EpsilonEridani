# Lagrangian graphs in a cotangent space

The graph of a linear map from a vector space to its dual is Lagrangian for the canonical
cotangent symplectic form precisely when the induced bilinear pairing is symmetric. The same
criterion holds for the continuous dual of a normed space. In particular, the graph of the
Hessian of a twice continuously differentiable real function is Lagrangian. The derivative of
the differential graph has this Hessian graph as its range, and the Liouville form pulls back
to the differential of the function.

The Hessian graph is the tangent-space model of the graph of the differential of a function,
the basic exact Lagrangian in a cotangent bundle. The sign convention is that of
`EpsilonEridani.cotangentSymplecticForm` and `EpsilonEridani.strongDualCotangentSymplecticForm`.

The geometric criterion is standard; see McDuff--Salamon, *Introduction to Symplectic
Topology*, Section 3.2.
