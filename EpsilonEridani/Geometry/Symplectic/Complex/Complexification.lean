# Complexification of almost complex structures

An almost complex structure on a real vector space extends complex-linearly to its
complexification. Its square remains `-1`, and its `i`- and `-i`-eigenspaces are complementary.
These complementary eigenspaces supply the two pieces used to construct a weight-one Hodge
structure from the real almost complex structure.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.AlmostComplexStructure.isCompl_eigenspace_baseChange_I_neg_I`: its `i`- and
  `-i`-eigenspaces are complementary.
