# The path traced by a diffeotopy

A diffeotopy of `M` is a `C^n` motion through self-diffeomorphisms, so its time slices are a
jointly `C^n` family of diffeomorphisms; `Diffeomorph.ofSmoothFamily` therefore makes them a
continuous curve in `EpsilonEridani.Diff` for the weak Whitney topology. Since a diffeotopy starts at
the identity, that curve is a path from `1` to the final diffeomorphism: a self-diffeomorphism
diffeotopic to the identity lies in the path component of `1`.

This application is kept apart from `EpsilonEridani.Geometry.Diffeomorphism.Topology` so that the
topology itself does not drag in diffeotopy theory and the real-manifold structure of the unit
interval.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Diffeotopy.toPath`: the path traced in `EpsilonEridani.Diff` by a diffeotopy.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Diffeotopy.continuous_timeSlice`: the time slices of a diffeotopy move continuously.
* `EpsilonEridani.Diffeotopy.joined_one_final`: the identity is joined to the final diffeomorphism.
