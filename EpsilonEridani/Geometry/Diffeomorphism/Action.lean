# The tautological action of the diffeomorphism group

The self-diffeomorphism group `M ≃ₘ^n⟮I, I⟯ M` acts on the underlying manifold by evaluation:
`φ • x = φ x`. This file records that action, its faithfulness, and continuity in the point.

The action formalization mirrors Mathlib's `Homeomorph.applyMulAction`
(`Mathlib.Topology.Algebra.ConstMulAction`, added in Kim Morrison's mathlib4#40135), which
generalizes `Equiv.Perm.applyMulAction`.

The evaluation action and the forgetful homomorphism `Diff(M) → Homeomorph(M)` are the basic
API relating the abstract group `Diff(M)` to the space it acts on: faithfulness identifies a
diffeomorphism with the permutation of `M` it induces, and continuity in the point records that
each diffeomorphism acts by a homeomorphism.

## Main definitions

* `Diffeomorph.applyMulAction`: the `MulAction (M ≃ₘ^n⟮I, I⟯ M) M` with
  `φ • x = φ x`.
* `Diffeomorph.applyFaithfulSMul`: the action is faithful.
* `Diffeomorph.applyContinuousConstSMul`: each diffeomorphism acts continuously.
* `Diffeomorph.applySubgroupContinuousConstSMul`: subgroups inherit continuity in the
  point.
