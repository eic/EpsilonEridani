# The dual of a pure Hodge structure

The dual `V^*` of a pure Hodge structure of weight `n` is a pure Hodge structure of weight `-n`
on the complex dual space: its filtration step at index `p` is the annihilator of the filtration
step of index `1 - p` of the original structure, and its conjugation is the twisted transpose of
the original conjugation, sending a functional `φ` to `v ↦ conj (φ (ω v))`.
The dual pairing then respects Hodge components of complementary indices: the `p`-th component
of the dual pairs nontrivially only against the component of index `-p`, and, when `W` is
finite-dimensional, has the same dimension as the `(-p)`-th component, so dualizing reflects
the table of Hodge numbers.

This is one of the companion constructions of Layer L0 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/HodgeStructures/README.md`
(the `⊗`/`Hom`/dual companions), following Peters–Steenbrink, *Mixed Hodge Structures*, §2; it is
the base on which the internal hom of Hodge structures is to be built.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.HodgeStructureOn.dual`: the dual pure Hodge structure, of weight `-n`; its
  conjugation is the twisted transpose `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.Conjugation.dual`, and the opposedness of
  its filtration holds since dual annihilators carry complements to complements.
* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.HodgeStructureOn.dual_F`, `…dual_conjF`: the step of the dual filtration at
  index `p` is the annihilator of the original step `1 - p`, and the conjugate step is the
  annihilator of the original conjugate step `1 - p`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.HodgeStructureOn.dual_piece`: the components of the dual structure are
  annihilators of sums of complementary filtration steps.
* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.HodgeStructureOn.finrank_dual_piece`: when `W` is finite-dimensional, the
  dimension of the `p`-th component of the dual equals that of the `(-p)`-th component.
* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.HodgeStructureOn.apply_eq_zero_of_mem_piece_of_ne`: the dual pairing vanishes
  between components unless their indices are complementary.
