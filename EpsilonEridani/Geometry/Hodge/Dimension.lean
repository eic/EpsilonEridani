# Hodge numbers

The `p`-th **Hodge number** of a weight-`n` Hodge structure is the dimension
`h^{p,n-p} = dim_ℂ H^{p,n-p}` of its `p`-th Hodge component. This file records the two facts that
make the family of Hodge numbers a numerical invariant of the structure:

* **Hodge symmetry**, `h^{p,q} = h^{q,p}`: the conjugation carries `H^{p,n-p}` onto `H^{n-p,p}`.
  It is only conjugate-linear, so it is not an isomorphism of complex vector spaces; it is an
  isomorphism of the underlying *real* vector spaces
  (`EpsilonEridani.Hodge.HodgeStructureOn.pieceConjEquiv`, in `EpsilonEridani/Geometry/Hodge/Structure.lean`),
  and the two dimensions over `ℂ` are both half of the common dimension over `ℝ`.
* **The Hodge numbers partition the dimension**, `∑ᶠ p, h^{p,n-p} = dim_ℂ V_ℂ`: only finitely many
  Hodge components are nonzero because the filtration is bounded, and they decompose `V_ℂ` as an
  internal direct sum.

For a Hodge structure carried on a lattice, `dim_ℂ V_ℂ` is in turn the rank of the lattice.

This follows the convention of `Module.finrank`, so an infinite-dimensional component has Hodge
number `0`; the statements that read the Hodge numbers as a dimension count, such as

and the **Hodge symmetry** `h p = h (weight - p)`.

The symmetry is not an extra restriction on the types that occur, since conjugation exchanges the
Hodge components `H^{p,q}` and `H^{q,p}` of any Hodge structure; it excludes the asymmetric
families of numbers that no Hodge structure realizes. -/

/-- The Hodge type of a Hodge structure: its weight together with its own Hodge numbers.

Both axioms of `HodgeType` hold for any Hodge structure: the support is finite because the Hodge
filtration is bounded, and the symmetry is Hodge symmetry. Following the convention of
`Module.finrank`, an infinite-dimensional Hodge component contributes the Hodge number `0`; the
statements reading these numbers as a dimension count, such as
`HodgeStructureOn.finsum_hodgeNumber_eq_finrank`, assume finite-dimensionality separately. -/
