# Tate Hodge structures

The Tate structure `ℤ(m)` is the rank-one pure Hodge structure of weight `-2m` and type
`(-m,-m)`. Its complexification is `ℂ`, with the integral lattice embedded by the usual map
`ℤ → ℂ`; its decreasing filtration is the whole line through degree `-m` and zero above it.

This is the first concrete nonzero inhabitant of `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.HodgeStructure`. Besides fixing the
weight and filtration-shift conventions needed by later Tate twists, it verifies directly that the
opposed-filtration definition has the intended rank-one objects. Multiplication of integers
polarizes it, so it also witnesses that the Hodge–Riemann relations are satisfiable.

The convention follows the Hodge structures roadmap and standard Hodge-theory notation; see
Voisin, *Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry I*, §7.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.tate`: the Tate Hodge structure `ℤ(m)` of weight `-2m`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.tate_F`: its filtration is `⊤` exactly in degrees at most `-m`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.tate_piece`: its only nonzero Hodge component has bidegree `(-m,-m)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.finrank_tate_piece`: its Hodge number there is one and all others are zero.
* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.tateHodgeType`: the numerical Hodge type of `ℤ(m)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.isPolarization_tate`: multiplication of integers satisfies the Hodge–Riemann
  relations for it, and `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.tatePolarization` bundles that as a polarization.
