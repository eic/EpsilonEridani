# Deligne's bigrading is an internal direct sum

`EpsilonEridani/Geometry/Hodge/Mixed/DeligneSplitting.lean` builds the bigrading `I^{p,q}` of a mixed
Hodge structure from Deligne's closed formula and proves what follows from the formula alone. This
file proves Deligne's theorem about it: the pieces `I^{p,q}` form an internal direct sum of the
complex vector space, and the complexified weight step `W_k` is exactly the supremum of the pieces
of total degree at most `k`,

`W_k = ⨆_{p + q ≤ k} I^{p,q}`.

Everything runs through the comparison of `I^{p,q}` with the pure Hodge structure carried by the
graded piece `gr^W_{p+q}`, built in `EpsilonEridani/Geometry/Hodge/Mixed/Graded.lean`. Three facts drive
it.

* `I^{p,q}` meets `W_{p+q-1}` trivially. A vector of `I^{p,q} ∩ W_m` with `m < p + q` lies in
  `F^p`, and lies in `conj F^{m+1-p}` modulo `W_{m-1}`; its class in `gr^W_m` therefore lies in
  two complementary steps of a pure Hodge structure of weight `m` and so vanishes, pushing the
  vector down to `W_{m-1}`. Iterating exhausts the weight filtration downwards.
* `I^{p,q}` covers the Hodge component `H^{p,q}` of `gr^W_{p+q}`, granted that `W_{p+q-1}` is
  already spanned by bigrading pieces. A representative of a class in `H^{p,q}` lies in `F^p` and
  is congruent modulo `W_{p+q-1}` to a vector of `conj F^q`; splitting the error term into the
  bigrading pieces whose first index is at least `p` — which lie in `F^p` — and those whose first
  index is smaller — which lie in the second factor of Deligne's formula — corrects the
  representative into `I^{p,q}` without changing its class. Running this against the Hodge
  decomposition of `gr^W_k` and inducting upwards on `k` from a weight step where the filtration
  vanishes gives the recovery of `W`, and with it that the bigrading spans.
* A weight step meets the supremum of the pieces of larger total degree trivially. This is a
  descending induction on the weight which peels off one total degree at a time, and independence
  follows: a vector of `I^{p,q}` lying in the sum of all the other pieces first loses its part of
  larger total degree, and what is left has a class in `gr^W_{p+q}` lying both in `H^{p,q}` and in
  the complementary `conj F^{q+1} ⊔ F^{p+1}`, hence vanishing.

The Hodge filtration is recovered from the bigrading by the same upward induction on the weight:
a vector of `F^p ∩ W_k` has its class in `gr^W_k` in the `p`-th step of the induced Hodge
filtration, so — the graded piece being pure — that class is a sum of Hodge components of first
index at least `p`, each the image of a bigrading piece; correcting the vector by a representative
of that sum drops it into `F^p ∩ W_{k-1}`.

The simultaneous recovery formula also supplies the lower-bidegree sums used to state and prove
the conjugation symmetry developed in `EpsilonEridani.Geometry.Hodge.Mixed.Conjugation`.

/-! ### A bigrading piece meets the lower weight steps trivially -/

/-- A vector of `I^{p,q}` lying in a weight step *below* its total degree already lies one step
further down.

Its class in `gr^W_m` lies both in the `p`-th step of the induced Hodge filtration and in the
`(m+1-p)`-th step of the conjugate one — the second because Deligne's formula puts `I^{p,q}` in
`conj F^{m+1-p}` modulo `W_{m-1}` — and those two steps of a pure Hodge structure of weight `m`
are complementary. -/

A representative is corrected by subtracting the part of its error term supported in first indices
at least `p`, which lies in `F^p` and in `W_{k-1}`, so that neither membership in `F^p` nor the
