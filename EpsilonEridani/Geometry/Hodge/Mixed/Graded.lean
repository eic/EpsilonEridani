# The pure Hodge structure on a complex graded piece

The purity axiom of a mixed Hodge structure is imposed on the *rational* graded pieces: the
complexification `ℂ ⊗[ℚ] grᵂ_k` of `grᵂ_k = W_k / W_{k-1}` carries a pure Hodge structure of
weight `k`. The mixed theory itself, however, runs inside the complex model: Deligne's bigrading
`I^{p,q}` is built from the Hodge filtration `F`, its conjugate, and the complexified weight
filtration `WC`, and its elements are compared with the Hodge components of
`WC_k / WC_{k-1}`. This file moves the pure structure from the first model to the second.

The transport is the identification `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.gradedComplexEquiv`, and what makes it
legitimate is that this identification intertwines the two conjugations
(`EpsilonEridani.Hodge.gradedComplexEquiv_latticeConj`): the canonical conjugation of a complexified
rational space on the left, and on the right the conjugation that lattice conjugation induces on
the complex graded piece, each step of `WC` being the complexification of a rational subspace and
therefore conjugation-stable.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.gradedConjugation`: the conjugation induced by lattice
  conjugation on the `k`-th complex graded piece.
* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.complexGradedHodgeStructure`: the pure Hodge structure of
  weight `k` carried by `WC_k / WC_{k-1}`, with its filtration
  `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.complexGradedF` and its Hodge components computed.
* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.isInternal_complexGradedHodgeStructure_piece`: the Hodge
  decomposition of a complex graded piece.
* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.mk_mem_complexGradedHodgeStructure_piece`: a vector of `W_k`
  that lies in `F^p` and lies in `conj F^{k-p}` modulo `W_{k-1}` has its class in the Hodge
  component `H^{p,k-p}` of the graded piece. This is the form in which the pieces of Deligne's
  bigrading meet the graded Hodge structure, and
  `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.mem_complexGradedHodgeStructure_piece_iff` shows the
  criterion is exact. `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.mk_mem_complexGradedHodgeStructure_F`
  and its conjugate analogue are the corresponding criteria for the two induced filtrations.

The second hypothesis is weaker than membership of `conj F^{k-p}`, and the weakening is what makes
the criterion usable: in the mixed theory the conjugation relations hold only modulo lower steps
of the weight filtration, which is exactly the shape in which the pieces of Deligne's bigrading
`I^{p,q}` present themselves. -/
