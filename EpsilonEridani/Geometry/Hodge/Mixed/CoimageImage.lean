# Coimages and images of mixed Hodge morphisms

The canonical map from the coimage of a mixed Hodge morphism to its image is an isomorphism.
Thus the quotient by the kernel agrees, as a mixed Hodge structure, with the image carrying
the induced filtrations. This is the first isomorphism theorem for mixed Hodge structures,
and supplies the coimage–image condition in the characterization of an abelian category.

Rational realization preserves kernels and cokernels and reflects isomorphisms by strictness.
Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Abelian.PreservesCoimageImageComparison.iso` therefore reduces the
comparison to the first isomorphism theorem for rational vector spaces.
