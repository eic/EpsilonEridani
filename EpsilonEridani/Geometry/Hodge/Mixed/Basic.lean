# Mixed Hodge structures

A mixed Hodge structure on an integral module is an increasing rational weight filtration `W`
together with a decreasing complex Hodge filtration `F` inducing a pure Hodge structure of weight
`k` on every rational graded piece `grᵂ_k = W_k / W_{k-1}`. The graded objects the purity
condition is stated against are built in `EpsilonEridani/Geometry/Hodge/Graded.lean`.

Purity is recorded as the existence of a `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.HodgeStructure` whose filtration *is* the
induced one, rather than as a restatement of the pure axioms or as the bare existence of some
Hodge structure on the graded piece: the former would duplicate the pure object, the latter would
lose the link with `F`. As a consequence every result about pure Hodge structures — Hodge
components, the Hodge decomposition, the Weil operator — applies to the graded pieces of a mixed
Hodge structure through `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.gradedHodgeStructure`.

A pure Hodge structure of weight `n` is a mixed Hodge structure whose weight filtration is
concentrated in degree `n`; this is `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.ofPure`, and it makes the
Tate structure `ℤ(m)` an explicit rank-one inhabitant.

/-- A mixed Hodge structure on an integral module `Vℤ` with rational and complex base-change
models `Vℚ` and `Vℂ`.

The weight filtration `WQ` is increasing, recorded rationally, and finite in both directions; the
Hodge filtration `F` is decreasing and bounded on the complex model. Purity is imposed on the
rational graded pieces: for every `k`, the filtration `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.gradedF` induced by `F` on
the complexification of `grᵂ_k = W_k / W_{k-1}` is the Hodge filtration of a pure Hodge structure
of weight `k`. -/
