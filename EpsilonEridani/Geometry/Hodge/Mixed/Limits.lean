# Isomorphisms of mixed Hodge structures

A morphism in the category of mixed Hodge structures is an isomorphism exactly when its
underlying rational map is bijective. This is Deligne's strictness: the inverse of a bijective
morphism preserves both filtrations (`EpsilonEridani.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.Hom.invOfBijective`), so
the rational realization reflects isomorphisms.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructureCat.isIso_iff_bijective`: isomorphisms are detected
  rationally.
* the instance `ReflectsIsomorphisms EpsilonEridani.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructureCat.rational`: the rational
  realization reflects isomorphisms.
