# Points of a period domain

Fix a lattice `V` — a finitely generated free `ℤ`-module — an integral bilinear form `Qint` on it,
and a prescribed family of Hodge numbers. A **point of the period domain** is a Hodge filtration
on the complexification of `V` that has those Hodge numbers and is polarized by that *same* form:
only the filtration varies from point to point, which is what makes the collection a classifying
space for polarized Hodge structures of a fixed numerical type.

The prescribed numerical data is packaged as `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.HodgeType`: a weight, Hodge numbers of
finite support, and Hodge symmetry `h p = h (weight - p)`. Every Hodge structure has one
(`EpsilonEridani.Hodge.HodgeStructureOn.hodgeType`), so the symmetry axiom excludes no type that a Hodge
structure realizes, and the Hodge structure underlying a point of the period domain has the
prescribed Hodge type (`EpsilonEridani.Hodge.PeriodDomain.Point.hodgeType_eq`).

The main theorem is the numerical shadow of the Hodge decomposition: the prescribed Hodge numbers
sum to the dimension of the complexification, equivalently to the rank of the lattice. It is a
genuine constraint on a `HodgeType`, since it rules out every type whose Hodge numbers do not add
up to the rank of the lattice one wants to carry it.

The symmetry group `Aut(V, Qint)` of the pair — where the monodromy of a variation of Hodge
structure lands — is not redefined here: it is `EpsilonEridani.BilinForm.isometryGroup Qint`, the subgroup
of `V ≃ₗ[ℤ] V` cut out by `EpsilonEridani.BilinForm.IsIsometry`. The complex-manifold structure on the set
of period-domain points is out of scope; it needs flag-variety topology.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.PeriodDomain.Point`: a point of the period domain of `(V, Qint)` at a fixed type.
* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.PeriodDomain.Point.finsum_h_eq_finrank`: **the Hodge numbers partition the
  dimension.**
* `EpsilonEridani.Hodge.tatePoint`: the Tate structure `ℤ(m)` as a point of its period domain.

The signature of `PeriodDomain.Point` is adapted from the roadmap's formal companion
`HodgeStructures/Suggested.lean`. The mathematics follows Griffiths, *Periods of integrals on
algebraic manifolds II*, §1, and Carlson–Müller-Stach–Peters, *Period Mappings and Period Domains*,
§4. This is Layer L3 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/HodgeStructures/README.md`.

/-- A **point of the period domain** of the lattice `V` with the integral form `Qint`, at the Hodge
type `htype`: a weight-`n` Hodge structure of that type which the *fixed* form `Qint` polarizes.

The lattice is a finitely generated free `ℤ`-module, so the complexification is finite-dimensional
and the prescribed Hodge numbers really are the dimensions of the Hodge components.

The form does not vary with the point; it enters through the `Prop`-valued `IsPolarization` and so
is not carried twice.

The `Module.Free` and `Module.Finite` binders are spelled out on the header rather than left to the
surrounding `variable` block: automatic instance inclusion applies to theorems, not to a
`structure`, so omitting them would drop them from the signature entirely. -/
