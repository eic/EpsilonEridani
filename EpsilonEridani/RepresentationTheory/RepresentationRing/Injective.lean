# Injectivity of the character map on the representation ring

Let `G` be a finite group and `k` a field of characteristic zero. This file
proves that the character homomorphism from the representation ring of `G` is injective. Thus a
virtual representation is determined by its character.

For the representation ring itself, every element of split `K₀` is a difference `[V] - [W]`.
A difference in the kernel has `V.character = W.character`, so the object-level theorem makes
`V` and `W` isomorphic and their difference vanishes. The object-level input is
`FDRep.nonempty_iso_of_character_eq`, proved in
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/Determined.lean` from Maschke decompositions and
the character pairing.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.repRingCharacter_injective`: the character homomorphism on the representation ring is
  injective.

## References

* J.-P. Serre, *Linear Representations of Finite Groups*, Part II, §9.1.

This is the injectivity target in Layer 6 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction/README.md`.
