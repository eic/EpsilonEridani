# Quaternionic structures on a complex representation

A **quaternionic structure** on a representation `ρ` of `G` on a complex vector space `V` is a
conjugate-linear map `J : V →ₗ⋆[ℂ] V` with `J (J v) = -v` that commutes with the action.  It is the
`-1` case of the Frobenius-Schur reality trichotomy; the `1` case is a real structure, a
conjugate-linear *involution* commuting with the action, `Representation.IsRealStructure` in
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/RealForm.lean`.

The two predicates differ only in the sign of the square, and the constructions in
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/InvariantForm/StructureMap.lean` treat them together.  What separates
them is that a quaternionic structure has no nonzero fixed vector
(`Representation.IsQuaternionicStructure.eq_zero_of_apply_eq_self`), so, unlike a real structure,
it cuts out no real form; that is why the real-form theory lives beside
`Representation.IsRealStructure` while this predicate stands on its own.

Only the predicate and the two facts that follow from its definition alone are here, so that
stating a quaternionic structure costs no invariant-form or finite-dimensional machinery.  Its
equivalence with a nondegenerate invariant alternating form, and the reading of the Frobenius-Schur
value `-1` off it, are in
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/InvariantForm/StructureMap.lean` and
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Compact/FrobeniusSchur/StructureMap.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `Representation.IsQuaternionicStructure`: a conjugate-linear `J` with `J (J v) = -v` commuting
  with the action.

## Main results

* `Representation.IsQuaternionicStructure.bijective`: a quaternionic structure is bijective.
* `Representation.IsQuaternionicStructure.eq_zero_of_apply_eq_self`: a quaternionic structure has no
  nonzero fixed vector.

/-- A **quaternionic structure** on a complex representation: a conjugate-linear map `J` of the
underlying space that squares to `-1` and commutes with the action.  It is the `-1` case of the
Frobenius-Schur reality trichotomy, `Representation.IsRealStructure` being the `1` case.

The two predicates differ only in the sign of the square, and the constructions of
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/InvariantForm/StructureMap.lean` treat them together; what separates
them is that a quaternionic structure has no nonzero fixed vector
(`Representation.IsQuaternionicStructure.eq_zero_of_apply_eq_self`), so no real form attaches to it.
The map is carried unbundled, matching `Representation.IsRealStructure` and
`EpsilonEridani.Representation.IsInvariantForm`. -/

-- `grind` splits a witness in the context into its two fields, so both defining equations are
-- available to it without the projections being invoked by hand.  `sq_eq_neg` cannot be registered
-- as a rewrite rule on its own: neither `G` nor `ρ` occurs in it, so `grind =` rejects it.
attribute [grind cases] IsQuaternionicStructure

-- The intertwining equation moves `J` past the action, which is the normal form the constructions
-- downstream use; `ρ` occurs in its left-hand side, so `simp` can instantiate it.  `sq_eq_neg`
-- cannot be tagged for the reason `grind =` rejects it: its left-hand side `J (J v)` mentions
-- neither `G` nor `ρ`, so `simpNF` reports that the lemma "will never apply".  It is passed
-- explicitly, `simp [h.sq_eq_neg]`, as `Representation.IsRealStructure.involutive` is.
