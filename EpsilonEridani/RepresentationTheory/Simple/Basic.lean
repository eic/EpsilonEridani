# Simple objects of `Rep k G` and `FDRep k G`, and their isomorphism classes

Two notions of "irreducible representation" coexist. `Representation.IsIrreducible ρ` says that the
lattice of subrepresentations of `ρ` has exactly two elements, and it is the notion in which the
representation-theoretic arguments of this repository are phrased.
`CategoryTheory.Simple X` says that `X` is nonzero and every monomorphism `f` into `X` satisfies
`IsIso f ↔ f ≠ 0`; it is the notion in which the categorical machinery is phrased -- Schur's lemma
`FDRep.finrank_hom_simple_simple`, the characters of simple objects, semisimple categories. Neither
Mathlib nor this repository previously related the two, which is why several files here stopped at
the `Representation` level. This file supplies the dictionary.

Over `Rep k G` the dictionary is bookkeeping. `Rep k G` is equivalent to the category of
`k[G]`-modules (`Rep.equivalenceModuleMonoidAlgebra`), an equivalence transports simplicity in both
directions, and a module is a simple object exactly when it is a simple module
(`simple_iff_isSimpleModule`).

`FDRep k G` is not known to be equivalent to a module category, so it needs an argument in each
direction. One is formal: the forgetful functor to `Rep k G` is faithful, preserves zero morphisms
and monomorphisms, and reflects isomorphisms, and such a functor reflects simplicity
(`CategoryTheory.Functor.simple_of_simple_obj`). The other uses finite-dimensionality, and is where
the restriction to `FDRep` earns its keep: a subrepresentation of a finite-dimensional
representation is again finite-dimensional, so it is again an object of `FDRep k G`, and its
inclusion is a monomorphism which is nonzero exactly when the subrepresentation is nonzero and an
isomorphism exactly when the subrepresentation is everything. Simplicity of the object therefore
says precisely that the lattice of subrepresentations is `{⊥, ⊤}` with `⊥ ≠ ⊤`.

The irreducible-to-simple directions are registered as instances. The converse directions are the
theorems `Rep.isIrreducible_of_simple` and `FDRep.isIrreducible_of_simple`; they are deliberately
not instances, since with the forward directions they would close a cycle in the instance graph.
One consequence of the converse directions not being instances is that inference cannot get from
`Simple X` to the simplicity of the `k[G]`-module `X.ρ.asModule`, even though Mathlib registers
that module as simple whenever `X.ρ` is irreducible. The single composite
`FDRep.isSimpleModule_asModule_of_simple` is therefore registered as an instance as well, so that
`Simple X` alone suffices for the module-level API; it is the third and last instance the file
exports.

A classification statement is valued in a type of *isomorphism classes*, and for simple objects of
`FDRep k G` that type needs no device: unlike abstract simple modules, which range over every
universe, the objects of `FDRep k G` already form a type, and Mathlib already quotients the objects
of a category by isomorphism. `EpsilonEridani.SimpleFDRepClasses` is that quotient, namely
`CategoryTheory.Skeleton` of the full subcategory of simple objects, together with the constructor,
eliminator and lift a consumer needs. It lives here rather than beside its comparison with the
module-level quotient (`EpsilonEridani.SimpleFDRepClasses.toSimpleSubmoduleClasses`, in
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Simple.FDRepClasses`) so that naming the isomorphism classes does not
drag in the semisimple isotypic-component theory that only the comparison needs.

## Main results

* `Rep.simple_iff_isIrreducible`: an object of `Rep k G` is simple exactly when the
  representation it carries is irreducible.
* `Rep.simple_of_isIrreducible` and `Rep.isIrreducible_of_simple`: the two directions as an
  instance and a theorem, respectively.
* `FDRep.simple_iff_isIrreducible`: the same for `FDRep k G`.
* `FDRep.simple_of_isIrreducible` and `FDRep.isIrreducible_of_simple`: the corresponding instance
  and theorem for `FDRep`.
* `FDRep.isSimpleModule_asModule_of_simple`: the instance making Mathlib's simple-module API on
  `X.ρ.asModule` available from `Simple X` alone.
* `EpsilonEridani.SimpleFDRepClasses`: the isomorphism classes of simple objects of `FDRep k G`.
* `EpsilonEridani.SimpleFDRepClasses.mk_eq_mk_iff`: two simple objects have the same class exactly when
  they are isomorphic in `FDRep k G`.
* `EpsilonEridani.SimpleFDRepClasses.ind` and `EpsilonEridani.SimpleFDRepClasses.lift`: the eliminator and the
  lift of an isomorphism-invariant function.
