# Character sums over a subgroup as operators

The character sum `∑_{h ∈ H} χ(h) h` of `EpsilonEridani.subgroupCharSum` lives in the group algebra
`k[G]`, so it acts on any representation of `G` through `Representation.asAlgebraHom`.  This file
records the two facts every computation with that operator starts from.

Expanding it is immediate from the definition: it acts as the `χ`-weighted sum of the operators
`ρ h` over `h ∈ H` (`EpsilonEridani.asAlgebraHom_subgroupCharSum_apply`).  Its vanishing is the
mechanism behind every antisymmetrizer argument: if some `p ∈ H` has `χ(p⁻¹) = -1`, the sum
absorbs `p` at the cost of a sign, so its value on a vector `p` fixes is its own negative, and
doubling being injective forces that value to be zero
(`EpsilonEridani.asAlgebraHom_subgroupCharSum_apply_eq_zero`).  Injective doubling is the hypothesis of
`Representation.asAlgebraHom_eq_zero_of_mul_single_eq_neg`, taken as an assumption rather than
read off the scalars, so no invertibility of `2` in `k` is needed.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.asAlgebraHom_subgroupCharSum_apply`: the character sum acts as `∑_{h ∈ H} χ(h) ρ(h)`;
* `EpsilonEridani.asAlgebraHom_subgroupCharSum_apply_eq_zero`: the character sum annihilates every vector
  fixed by an element of `H` whose inverse has character `-1`.

/-- **A character sum annihilates whatever an element of character `-1` fixes.**  Right
multiplication by `p ∈ H` rescales the sum by `χ(p⁻¹) = -1`, so the value of the sum on a vector
fixed by `p` is its own negative; with doubling injective it vanishes. -/
