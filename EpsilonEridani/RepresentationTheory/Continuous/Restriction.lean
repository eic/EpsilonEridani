# Restriction of continuous representations

This file records basic compatibility results between continuous representations and restriction
along monoid homomorphisms.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.res_trivial`: restriction of a trivial representation is trivial on the nose.

/-- Restriction of a trivial representation along a monoid homomorphism is the corresponding
trivial representation of the source monoid, on the nose.

For groups, `TopRep.res` is a reducible abbreviation for the left-hand side, so this lemma also
proves the corresponding equality stated with `TopRep.res` verbatim. -/
