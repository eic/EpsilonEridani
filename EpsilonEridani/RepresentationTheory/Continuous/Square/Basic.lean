# The symmetric and exterior squares of a continuous representation

The tensor square `EpsilonEridani.ContRepresentation.tprod π π` of a continuous representation acts on
`V ⊗[𝕜] V` by `π g ⊗ π g`, which commutes with the flip `x ⊗ y ↦ y ⊗ x`. The two eigenspaces of
that flip, `EpsilonEridani.symmetricTensors` and `EpsilonEridani.antisymmetricTensors`, are therefore invariant
submodules, and restricting the tensor square to them gives the **symmetric square** and the
**exterior square** of `π`, again as continuous representations.

Realizing the two squares inside `V ⊗[𝕜] V` rather than as `Sym[𝕜]^2 V` and `⋀[𝕜]^2 V` is what
makes them continuous representations at all: the carrier of a continuous representation has to
carry a topology, and a submodule of the tensor square of an inner product space does, whereas a
quotient or a subobject of a `PiTensorProduct` carries none. Over `RCLike 𝕜`, which has
characteristic zero, the two eigenspaces *are* the symmetric and exterior squares, which is what
the names record; the identification itself is not formalized here.

## Main definitions

* `ContRepresentation.symmetricSquare`: the tensor square of a continuous representation restricted
  to the symmetric tensors of `V ⊗[𝕜] V`.
* `ContRepresentation.exteriorSquare`: its restriction to the antisymmetric tensors.

## Main statements

* `ContRepresentation.continuous_symmetricSquare` and
  `ContRepresentation.continuous_exteriorSquare`: both squares of a continuous representation are
  continuous.
* `ContRepresentation.symmetricSquare_apply` and `ContRepresentation.exteriorSquare_apply`: each
  square acts by the restriction of `π g ⊗ π g`, which is how their characters are computed.
* `ContRepresentation.mem_invariants_symmetricSquare_iff` and
  `ContRepresentation.mem_invariants_exteriorSquare_iff`: a tensor of either eigenspace is invariant
  for that square exactly when it is invariant for the tensor square.

## Implementation notes

Nothing here needs a group, a measure, or compactness, so the statements are made over a
topological monoid with `RCLike` scalars; the consumer is
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Compact/FrobeniusSchur/InvariantTensors.lean`, where the invariants
of the two squares are what the Frobenius-Schur indicator counts.

All declarations sit in the **root** `ContRepresentation` namespace, so that
`π.symmetricSquare` elaborates: `ContRepresentation` is Mathlib's type, and
`scripts/lint-dot-notation.py` asks that new declarations about it not recreate its namespace
inside `EpsilonEridani`. That is why the ambient `EpsilonEridani` names this file consumes are brought in by
`open`.
