# Finite affine groups as Frobenius groups

For a finite ring `F` without zero divisors, the translations form the Frobenius kernel associated
to the linear factor.  When `F` is a division ring with at least three elements, its linear factor
is a Frobenius complement, so the affine group `F ⋊ Fˣ` is a Frobenius group.  The general Frobenius
theorem constructs the kernel from the complement alone; the main result here identifies that
abstractly constructed subgroup with the visible translation factor.

The specialization to `ZMod 5` gives the affine group of order twenty, with kernel of order
five and complement of order four.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.frobeniusKernelSubgroup_affineLinearSubgroup`: the Frobenius kernel is the translation
  subgroup.
* `EpsilonEridani.card_frobeniusKernelSubgroup_affineLinearSubgroup`: the kernel has `|F|` elements.
* `EpsilonEridani.card_affineLinearSubgroup`: the complement has `|F| - 1` elements.
* `EpsilonEridani.card_affineGroup`: the affine group has `|F| (|F| - 1)` elements.
* `EpsilonEridani.card_affineGroup_zmod_five`: the `F₅` example has order twenty.

The construction follows Isaacs, *Character Theory of Finite Groups*, Chapter 7.
