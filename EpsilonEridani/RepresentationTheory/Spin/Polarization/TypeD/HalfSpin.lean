# Half-spin parity in the split type-D model

The split type-`D` spinor model has two distinguished exterior-basis vectors: the vector with every
coordinate occupied and the vector obtained by erasing the final coordinate.  The generic
half-spin API identifies the summand of an exterior-basis vector from the parity of its degree.
This file records that identification for those two vectors, so their Cartan weights and their
half-spin summands can be used together by the highest-weight construction.

The four equivalences below are the only specialization needed: the all-coordinate vector lies in
the even or odd summand according to the parity of `n`, while erasing the final coordinate flips
that parity.  The index bound is only needed to form the final element of `Fin n`.

The conventions agree with the parity decomposition of the exterior algebra in Fulton and Harris,
*Representation Theory: A First Course*, §20.2.
