# The dimensions of the half-spin summands

`EpsilonEridani.spinRep` realizes the spinor module of a polarized quadratic space `(V, Q)` on the
exterior algebra `S = ⋀·W` of the isotropic summand `W` of the polarization, and
`EpsilonEridani.spinPlus` and `EpsilonEridani.spinMinus` cut it into its even and odd halves. This file counts
those halves.

The count of `S` itself needs nothing new: it is `EpsilonEridani.ExteriorAlgebra.finrank_eq_two_pow` read
on the module `⋀·W` that carries the spin representation, giving `dim S = 2 ^ dim W`. The count of
the two halves is not a formality, because `⋀·W` is the Clifford algebra of the *zero* form, where
the classical argument — multiply by an anisotropic vector, which is odd and invertible — has
nothing to multiply by. The odd invertible operator is instead multiplication corrected by a
contraction, Mathlib's `CliffordAlgebra.changeFormAux`, turned into an automorphism of the grading
in `EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/CliffordAlgebra/ParitySwap.lean`; here the count it yields,
`CliffordAlgebra.finrank_evenOdd_zero`, is only consumed. So each half is exactly half of `S`, of
dimension `2 ^ (dim W - 1)` — the dimension of a half-spin representation.

The hypothesis `W ≠ ⊥` is real: for `W = 0` the spinor module is the ground field, sitting entirely
in the even half, and there is no half-spin splitting to speak of.

A polarization also fixes `dim W` in terms of `dim V`, by the dimension count that comes with the
polarization data itself (`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Spin/Polarization/Basic.lean`): `dim W = l`
both in even dimension `2l`, the type `Dₗ` case, where the remainder of the polarization vanishes
(`EpsilonEridani.SpinPolarizationData.line_eq_bot_of_even_finrank`) so that the two halves are
subrepresentations of dimension `2 ^ (l - 1)`, and in odd dimension `2l + 1`, the type `Bₗ` case,
where the remainder is a line, the splitting is not one of representations (see
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Spin/HalfSpin/Basic.lean`) and the spin module of dimension `2 ^ l`
is the one that matters.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.finrank_spinPlus` and `EpsilonEridani.finrank_spinMinus`: **each half-spin summand has
  dimension `2 ^ (dim W - 1)`.**

Half the dimension `2 ^ dim W` of the spinor module `⋀·W`, so `2 ^ (l - 1)` for a polarization of
a `2l`-dimensional space, where `dim W = l` by

the degenerate case `⋀·W = K`, which is entirely even. -/
