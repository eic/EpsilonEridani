# The structure theorem for an even-dimensional Clifford algebra

A polarization of a quadratic space `(V, Q)` splits it as `W ⊕ W' ⊕ L` and makes the exterior
algebra `S = ⋀·W` a module over `CliffordAlgebra Q` — the Fock model `EpsilonEridani.spinAction`. That
action is *onto* `Module.End K S` when `W` is finite free (`EpsilonEridani.spinAction_surjective`): every
endomorphism of `S` is a polynomial in the creation and annihilation operators.

This file proves the **structure theorem**, which is a dimension count. Deforming a quadratic form
deforms the multiplication of its Clifford algebra and leaves the size alone, so
`finrank (CliffordAlgebra Q) = 2 ^ finrank V` for every form
(`CliffordAlgebra.finrank_eq_two_pow`), while `finrank (Module.End K S) = (2 ^ finrank W) ^ 2`.
The dimension bookkeeping for a polarization, in
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Spin/Polarization/Basic.lean`, shows that in even dimension
`finrank W` is exactly half of `finrank V`. The two dimensions therefore agree, and the surjection
`EpsilonEridani.spinAction` is forced to be an isomorphism:

`EpsilonEridani.SpinPolarizationData.cliffordEquivEnd : CliffordAlgebra Q ≃ₐ[K] Module.End K (⋀·W)`,

or, in a basis of `S`, `EpsilonEridani.SpinPolarizationData.cliffordEquivMatrix`, the matrix algebra
`M_{2^l}(K)` for `finrank V = 2 * l`. Since `EpsilonEridani.SpinPolarizationData.ofNondegenerate` builds a
polarization for every finite-dimensional nondegenerate quadratic space over a separably closed
field of characteristic different from two, this specializes to the field-level statement
`CliffordAlgebra.nonempty_algEquiv_matrix_of_finrank_eq_two_mul`.

The direction of the argument is worth recording: the spin module is built first and the structure
theorem is derived *from* it.

The same action identifies the even Clifford subalgebra with the product of the endomorphism
algebras of the exterior-parity summands `S⁺` and `S⁻`. Surjectivity onto that product is the
substance: an endomorphism preserving both summands comes from a unique Clifford element, and its
odd component must vanish because it both preserves and reverses parity.

The odd-dimensional case is not proved here. There `finrank L = 1` and the count gives
`finrank (CliffordAlgebra Q) = 2 * (2 ^ l) ^ 2`, so `EpsilonEridani.spinAction` cannot be injective. Away
from characteristic two the centre of the Clifford algebra of a nondegenerate odd-dimensional form
is a quadratic étale algebra over `K`, so over a separably closed field it is `K × K`, the Clifford
algebra is a product of two matrix algebras, and the action factors through one of the two central
idempotents. Over a general field that centre can be a field, and then there is no such product
decomposition. The idempotent half of that splitting is proved in
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/CliffordAlgebra/OddSplitting.lean`: `CliffordAlgebra.equivEvenProd` splits
the Clifford algebra of a central odd square root of one as two copies of its even subalgebra, and
`CliffordAlgebra.nonempty_algEquiv_even_prod_of_isSepClosed` supplies that square root over a
separably closed field. What is still separate work is identifying `even Q` for an odd-dimensional
form with a matrix algebra, which is what would turn that product into the product of two matrix
algebras.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.SpinPolarizationData.cliffordEquivEnd`: the structure theorem in operator form, the
  Fock action promoted to an algebra isomorphism onto `Module.End K (⋀·W)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.SpinPolarizationData.cliffordEquivMatrix`: the same isomorphism read in a basis of the
  spinor module, onto `Matrix (Fin (2 ^ l)) (Fin (2 ^ l)) K`.
* `EpsilonEridani.SpinPolarizationData.evenCliffordEquivProdEnd`: the even structure theorem in operator
  form, onto the product of the endomorphism algebras of `S⁺` and `S⁻`.
* `EpsilonEridani.SpinPolarizationData.evenCliffordEquivProdMatrix`: its product-of-matrix-algebras form.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.spinAction_bijective`: the Fock action is faithful, hence
  bijective, in even dimension.
* `EpsilonEridani.evenSpinActionProd_surjective`: the even Clifford action exhausts the paired
  endomorphism algebras of the half-spin summands.
* `CliffordAlgebra.nonempty_algEquiv_matrix_of_finrank_eq_two_mul`: the matrix-algebra equivalence
  over a separably closed field.

The count is `finrank (CliffordAlgebra Q) = 2 ^ finrank V = 2 ^ (2 * l) = (2 ^ l) ^ 2 =
finrank (Module.End K S)`, where the outer two equalities hold for every quadratic form on a
finite free module and the inner one is the even-dimensional reading of the summand dimensions
above. Injectivity of the Fock action is then forced by its surjectivity. Two is inverted
throughout, as it already is in the dimension count `CliffordAlgebra.finrank_eq_two_pow`. -/
