# The weights of the half-spin summands

`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Spin/Weight.lean` diagonalizes the spinor module `S = ⋀·W` of a
polarization under the commuting diagonal bivectors `H i`: the weight spaces are the lines spanned
by the exterior basis vectors, the weight of the vector indexed by a finite set `s` of coordinates
being the sign vector `spinWeight K s = ½(±1, …, ±1)` whose `+` signs are the elements of `s`.
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Spin/HalfSpin/Basic.lean` splits the same module along exterior
parity, as `S⁺ ⊕ S⁻`.

This file matches the two decompositions. Each is indexed by the exterior basis, so they are
compatible in the strongest sense: **every weight line lies in one of the two half-spin summands**,
and which one is decided by the parity of the number of `+` signs of its weight. So the weights of
`S⁺` are the sign vectors with an even number of `+` signs, those of `S⁻` the ones with an odd
number, and `S⁺` and `S⁻` are the sums of the corresponding weight lines.

The count that comes with this is the one a half-spin representation should have. On `l`
coordinates there are `2 ^ l` sign vectors (`EpsilonEridani.ncard_range_spinWeight`), and for `l > 0`
parity splits them evenly, so each summand carries `2 ^ (l - 1)` weights. On no coordinates at all
the split is uneven: the one sign vector is the empty one, which is even, so `S⁺` carries that
single weight and `S⁻` carries none — which is why
`EpsilonEridani.ncard_setOf_spinWeightSpace_ne_bot_and_le_spinMinus` asks the coordinates to be nonempty
and its `S⁺` counterpart does not. Over a field, and for a polarization whose `W` is
finite-dimensional and nonzero, `2 ^ (l - 1)` is also the dimension of each summand, computed
independently in `EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Spin/Dimension.lean` by a Clifford-algebraic
argument (`EpsilonEridani.finrank_spinPlus` and `EpsilonEridani.finrank_spinMinus`, both of which exclude
`W = ⊥`, the same degenerate case).

Nothing here needs a field, a nondegeneracy hypothesis, a finite dimension, or a polarization
without a line summand: the parity grading of `⋀·W` and the diagonalization are both available
over the commutative ring the polarization data lives over. The parity statements of the first
section hold over any commutative ring, nontriviality being needed only where a parity is *read
off* a basis vector, that vector having to be nonzero for its parity to be well defined. The
weight-space statements inherit from `EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Spin/Weight.lean` the standing
hypothesis that `2` be invertible — without it the sign vector `EpsilonEridani.spinWeight` is not even
defined — and that is the only extra hypothesis the inclusions and the identification of the two
summands carry; the exact descriptions of the weight sets of `S⁺` and `S⁻`, and the two counts of
weights read off them, ask in addition that `K` have no zero divisors, since deciding which weight
spaces are nonzero does.

As in `EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Spin/Weight.lean`, "weight" means a tuple of simultaneous
eigenvalues for the family `H`, no Cartan subalgebra being exhibited; and no weight is called
highest, since no ordering of the coordinates is used to single out a Borel. What the parity
statements do supply for the type-`Dₗ` fork is the parity flip between the two candidate
highest-weight vectors of `EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Spin/Polarization/TypeD/ForkWeights.lean`:
by `EpsilonEridani.basis_mem_spinPlus_iff_basis_erase_mem_spinMinus`, specialized to `ι = Fin n` at
`s = Finset.univ` and `i` the final coordinate `⟨n - 1, _⟩` — the coordinate that `ForkWeights.lean`
erases — the basis vector with every coordinate occupied lies in `S⁺` exactly when the one obtained
from it by erasing that final coordinate lies in `S⁻`. For an arbitrary index type the theorem
erases an arbitrary occupied coordinate, that generality having no fork reading. That equivalence
between two memberships is all it says; which summand each of the two vectors actually lies in is
read off `EpsilonEridani.basis_mem_spinPlus_iff` and `EpsilonEridani.basis_mem_spinMinus_iff`, from the parity
of the number of coordinates.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.basis_mem_spinPlus_iff` and `EpsilonEridani.basis_mem_spinMinus_iff`: **an exterior basis
  vector lies in the half-spin summand selected by the parity of its number of coordinates.**
* `EpsilonEridani.spinWeightSpace_le_spinPlus_iff` and `EpsilonEridani.spinWeightSpace_le_spinMinus_iff`: the
  same statement for the weight line the basis vector spans.
* `EpsilonEridani.iSup_spinWeightSpace_even_eq_spinPlus` and
  `EpsilonEridani.iSup_spinWeightSpace_odd_eq_spinMinus`: **each half-spin summand is the sum of the
  weight lines of its parity**, with `EpsilonEridani.iSup_spinWeightSpace_even_le_spinPlus` and
  `EpsilonEridani.iSup_spinWeightSpace_odd_le_spinMinus` the easy inclusions.
* `EpsilonEridani.setOf_spinWeightSpace_ne_bot_and_le_spinPlus_eq_image_spinWeight_even` and
  `EpsilonEridani.setOf_spinWeightSpace_ne_bot_and_le_spinMinus_eq_image_spinWeight_odd`: **the weights
  of a half-spin summand are the sign vectors of the matching parity**, and
  `EpsilonEridani.ncard_setOf_spinWeightSpace_ne_bot_and_le_spinPlus` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ncard_setOf_spinWeightSpace_ne_bot_and_le_spinMinus` count them, `2 ^ (l - 1)` each,
  the `S⁻` count on a nonempty set of coordinates.
* `EpsilonEridani.basis_mem_spinPlus_iff_basis_erase_mem_spinMinus` and
  `EpsilonEridani.basis_mem_spinMinus_iff_basis_erase_mem_spinPlus`: **erasing an occupied coordinate
  flips the summand**, a basis vector lying in `S⁺` exactly when the one obtained from it by
  erasing one of its coordinates lies in `S⁻`, and in `S⁻` exactly when that one lies in `S⁺`.
  Specialized to `ι = Fin n` at `s = Finset.univ` and `i` the final coordinate `⟨n - 1, _⟩`,
  these are the two type-`Dₗ` fork vectors.
