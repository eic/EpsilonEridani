# Continuous cohomology of a discrete representation of a compact group

Mathlib builds continuous cohomology as the homology of the homogeneous cochain complex, whose
terms are the invariants of the iterated coinduced representations `C(G, C(G, …, X.V))`. Over a
compact group `G` and for a representation whose underlying module is discrete, every one of those
function spaces is discrete in the compact-open topology, hence so is every term of the complex and
every subquotient of it. So `continuousCohomology n X` is a *discrete* topological module.

This matters because the topology is part of the statement. The low-degree explicit model presents
`H¹` and `H²` as quotients of subgroups of `G → M` and `G × G → M`; those carry the pointwise
topology, whose quotient is not discrete for an infinite profinite `G` (with trivial `ZMod 2`
coefficients on an infinite product of copies of `ZMod 2`, no finite set of evaluations isolates
the zero character). A comparison between the explicit model and the canonical one must therefore
say in which category it holds, and the results here are what make the canonical side of that
comparison a discrete object.

This implements the "category of the comparison" milestone of Layer 3 of the human-authored
roadmap at `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ProfiniteCohomology/README.md`.
