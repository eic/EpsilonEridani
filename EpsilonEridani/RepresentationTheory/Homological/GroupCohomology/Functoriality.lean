# Functoriality of group cohomology

The map on group cohomology along the trivial homomorphism `1 : G →* H` factors through the
cohomology of the trivial group, so it vanishes in every positive degree. In degree one this is
Mathlib's `groupCohomology.map₁_one`.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.groupCohomology.map_one_succ`: the map along the trivial homomorphism vanishes in
  positive degrees.
