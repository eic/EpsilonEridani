# Dimension shifting in ordinary group cohomology

For a representation `A` of a group `G`, the upward dimension-shifting sequence

`0 ⟶ A ⟶ Coind_⊥^G A ⟶ dimensionShiftUp A ⟶ 0`

has a middle term whose cohomology vanishes in every positive degree (Shapiro's lemma). Its
connecting homomorphism is therefore an isomorphism `Hⁿ⁺¹(G, dimensionShiftUp A) ≅ Hⁿ⁺²(G, A)`,
and surjective in the remaining degree `H⁰(G, dimensionShiftUp A) ⟶ H¹(G, A)`. The same holds
after restriction to any subgroup, so a vanishing hypothesis can be moved between degrees
simultaneously on all subgroups, which is what the inflation-restriction sequence needs.

Only the upward sequence appears here. The downward sequence has `Ind_⊥^G A` as its middle term,
which is acyclic for ordinary cohomology only when `G` is finite; the downward shift is therefore
stated for Tate cohomology instead, in `EpsilonEridani.TateCohomology.dimensionShiftDownIso`.

Each isomorphism below has Mathlib's `groupCohomology.δ` as its forward map, so its naturality is
the existing naturality of `δ` and no abstract choice of isomorphism enters.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.groupCohomology.dimensionShiftUpIso`, `dimensionShiftUpResIso`: the shift as an
  isomorphism, over `G` and after restriction to a subgroup.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.groupCohomology.dimensionShiftUpIso_hom`, `dimensionShiftUpResIso_hom`: the shift is
  Mathlib's connecting homomorphism `groupCohomology.δ` of `Rep.dimensionShiftUpSES`.
* `EpsilonEridani.groupCohomology.isZero_dimensionShiftUp_iff`,
  `EpsilonEridani.groupCohomology.isZero_res_dimensionShiftUp_iff`: the shift moves a vanishing
  hypothesis between degrees, which is the form the inflation-restriction sequence consumes.
* `EpsilonEridani.groupCohomology.epi_δ_dimensionShiftUp_zero`,
  `EpsilonEridani.groupCohomology.epi_δ_res_dimensionShiftUp_zero`: in the remaining degree the
  connecting homomorphism `H⁰(dimensionShiftUp A) ⟶ H¹(A)` is only surjective, over `G` and
  after restriction to a subgroup.
