# Corestriction in negative Tate degrees

Let `f : H → G` be a homomorphism of finite groups and let `M` be a `G`-representation. In
every Tate degree at most `-2`, Mathlib identifies Tate cohomology with ordinary group homology:

`Ĥ⁻ⁿ⁻¹(G, M) ≃ Hₙ(G, M)` for `n > 0`.

Ordinary group homology is covariant in the group, so `f` gives
corestriction

`Ĥ⁻ⁿ⁻¹(H, M) ⟶ Ĥ⁻ⁿ⁻¹(G, M)`.

This file packages that composite in every such degree and proves that transport back through
the Tate comparison is exactly Mathlib's group-homology map. The construction is a natural
transformation in the coefficient representation. Degree `-2`, which corresponds to first group
homology and hence to the abelianization for trivial integral coefficients, is exported under the
separate name `HNegTwoCor` for the low-degree Artin--Tate applications. Its interaction with the
low-degree homology comparison is recorded explicitly.

This construction treats degrees at most `-2` via group homology; positive degrees instead require
a cohomological corestriction construction.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.TateCohomology.negSuccCorNatTrans`: corestriction along a group homomorphism in degree
  `-(n+1)`, natural in the
  coefficient representation, for `n > 0`.
* `EpsilonEridani.TateCohomology.negSuccCor`: its value on one representation.
* `EpsilonEridani.TateCohomology.HNegTwoCor`: the degree-`-2` specialization.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.TateCohomology.negSuccCor_comp_negSuccIso_hom`: negative corestriction agrees
  with ordinary group-homology corestriction through `EpsilonEridani.TateCohomology.negSuccIso`.
* `EpsilonEridani.TateCohomology.map_comp_negSuccCor`: negative corestriction is natural in its
  coefficients.
