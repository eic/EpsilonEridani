# Linearity of Tate cohomology in the coefficient morphism

Mathlib shows that the Tate complex of a representation of a finite group is an additive functor
of the representation. This file records that it is moreover `k`-linear, and deduces that Tate
cohomology in each integer degree is an additive, `k`-linear functor: the map induced on
`tateCohomology · n` by `c • f` is `c` times the map induced by `f`.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.TateCohomology.tateComplex_map_smul`: the chain map of Tate complexes induced by
  `c • f` is `c • tateComplex.map f`.
* The `Functor.Linear` instances on `tateComplexFunctor k G` and on `tateCohomologyFunctor n`,
  and the `Functor.Additive` instance on `tateCohomologyFunctor n`.
