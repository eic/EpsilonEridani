# Commuting permutation representations

If monoids `G` and `H` act on a type `X` and the two actions commute, then the permutation
representations `Representation.ofMulAction k G X` and `Representation.ofMulAction k H X` on the
free `k`-module `k[X]` commute with each other. For the left and right multiplication actions of
a group `G`, that is, commuting actions of `G` and `Gᵐᵒᵖ`, this makes `k[X]` a `k[G]`-bimodule.

When `G` and `H` are groups, `G` permutes the `H`-orbits, and the orbit sums of `k[X]` along the
`H`-orbits are equivariant: the sum of the coefficients of `g • v` along the `H`-orbit of `g • x`
is the sum of the coefficients of `v` along the `H`-orbit of `x`. Hence if `g` fixes
`∑ i ∈ s, h i • v` for a family `h : ι → H` and `#s` is cancellable in `k`, then the `H`-orbit
sums of `v` are invariant under `g`. The orbit sums of `v` are the finitely supported function
`v.coeff.mapDomain (Quotient.mk (MulAction.orbitRel H X))` on the orbit space.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.commute_ofMulAction`: commuting actions on `X` give commuting permutation
  representations on `k[X]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.mapDomain_orbitRel_mk_coeff_ofMulAction`: the orbit sums of `k[X]` are invariant
  under the permutation representation.
* `EpsilonEridani.mapDomain_orbitRel_mk_coeff_ofMulAction_smul`: for commuting actions of `G` and `H`,
  the `H`-orbit sums of `g • v` at `g • x` are those of `v` at `x`.
* `EpsilonEridani.mapDomain_orbitRel_mk_coeff_smul_of_ofMulAction_sum`: if `g` fixes
  `∑ i ∈ s, h i • v` and `#s` is cancellable, the `H`-orbit sums of `v` are `g`-invariant.
