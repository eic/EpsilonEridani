# The Schur multiplier and the class of a projective representation

The factor set `α` of a projective representation `ρ : G → (V ≃ₗ[k] V)` is a normalized
multiplicative `2`-cocycle of `G` with values in `kˣ`, so it has a class in

`H²(G, kˣ) = EpsilonEridani.schurMultiplier k G`,

the **Schur multiplier** of `G` over `k`. The factor set itself is not an invariant of the
projective action: replacing the lift `ρ` by `g ↦ c g • ρ g` multiplies `α` by the coboundary of
`c`. Its class is, and that is the point of this file.

Because the lift can be rescaled, the honest statements are these. The class is unchanged by
rescaling (`EpsilonEridani.IsProjectiveRep.cohomologyClass_rescale`), so two lifts of the same projective
action have the same class (`EpsilonEridani.IsProjectiveRep.cohomologyClass_eq_of_eq_smul`). The class
**vanishes exactly when the projective representation is a linear representation in disguise**
(`EpsilonEridani.IsProjectiveRep.cohomologyClass_eq_zero_iff`): the obstruction to rescaling `ρ` into a
homomorphism `G →* (V ≃ₗ[k] V)` is precisely the class of its factor set. Every class occurs
(`EpsilonEridani.exists_isProjectiveRep_cohomologyClass_eq`), already on the twisted regular
representation, so `H²(G, kˣ)` is exactly the set of classes of projective representations of `G`
over `k`. And the twisted monoid algebra `k_α[G]` sees only the class
(`EpsilonEridani.TwistedMonoidAlgebra.nonempty_algEquiv_of_cohomologyClass_eq`).

Two of these need `kˣ` to act faithfully on `V`, and genuinely so: on `V = 0` every lift is the
zero map and every normalized factor set whatsoever is a factor set for it, so nothing about `α`
can be read off `ρ` there. Only scalars in `kˣ` are ever compared, so faithfulness is asked of the
units; `k` itself acting faithfully — on a nonzero vector space, say — supplies it. The two
directions of the lifting criterion are therefore also recorded separately, the direction that does
not need faithfulness being stated for an arbitrary module.

## The action on the scalars

`EpsilonEridani.FactorSet` and its cohomology class are set up for an arbitrary `MulDistribMulAction` of
`G` on the coefficients, whereas a projective representation carries none: its factor set takes
values in the *central* `kˣ`. So the whole file runs under the trivial action
`EpsilonEridani.trivialMulDistribMulAction`, installed as a local instance exactly as in
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/ProjectiveRepresentation/Extension.lean`. The roadmap spells the
coefficient module `Rep.trivial ℤ G (Additive kˣ)`; `Rep.ofMulDistribMulAction G kˣ` for the
trivial action is that module, and it is the spelling that both Mathlib's multiplicative interface
to `groupCohomology.cocycles₂` and `EpsilonEridani.FactorSet.cohomologyClass` are stated in, so it is the
one used here.

`Rep ℤ G` puts the group and the coefficients in the universe of `ℤ`, so `k` and `G` are pinned to
`Type`; this is the same restriction `EpsilonEridani/GroupTheory/GroupExtension/Cohomology.lean` carries.
The module `V` stays universe-polymorphic.

`EpsilonEridani.schurMultiplier` deliberately carries no result-type ascription. Writing `ModuleCat ℤ`
would elaborate the `Ring ℤ` argument by instance search, whereas `groupCohomology.H2` produces it
from the `CommRing ℤ` of `Rep ℤ G`; the two are the same instance up to unfolding but not
syntactically, and rewriting across the difference then fails.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.schurMultiplier`: the Schur multiplier `H²(G, kˣ)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsProjectiveRep.factorSet`: the factor set of a projective representation, bundled as a
  `EpsilonEridani.FactorSet` for the trivial action.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsProjectiveRep.cohomologyClass`: its class in the Schur multiplier.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsProjectiveRep.cohomologyClass_of_monoidHom`: a linear representation has
  vanishing class.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsProjectiveRep.cohomologyClass_rescale`: rescaling the lift does not move the class,
  and `EpsilonEridani.IsProjectiveRep.cohomologyClass_eq_of_eq_smul`: two lifts differing by scalars have
  the same class.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsProjectiveRep.cohomologyClass_eq_zero_iff`: **the class vanishes exactly when the lift
  is a linear representation rescaled by scalars**, with
  `EpsilonEridani.IsProjectiveRep.exists_monoidHom_of_cohomologyClass_eq_zero` and
  `EpsilonEridani.IsProjectiveRep.cohomologyClass_eq_zero_of_monoidHom` its two directions.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_isProjectiveRep_cohomologyClass_eq`: **every class in the Schur multiplier is the
  class of a projective representation**, so the Schur multiplier is exactly the set of classes of
  factor sets of projective representations of `G` over `k`.
* `EpsilonEridani.TwistedMonoidAlgebra.nonempty_algEquiv_of_cohomologyClass_eq`: the twisted monoid algebra
  depends only on the class.
