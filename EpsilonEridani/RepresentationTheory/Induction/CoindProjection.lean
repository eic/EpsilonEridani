# The dual projection formula for coinduced representations

For a group homomorphism `φ : G →* H`, a `G`-representation `A` and an `H`-representation `B`, the
*dual projection formula* is the isomorphism of `H`-representations

`Coind_φ (Hom(Res_φ B, A)) ≅ Hom(B, Coind_φ A)`.

It is the exact dual of the projection formula `Ind_φ (A ⊗ Res_φ B) ≅ (Ind_φ A) ⊗ B` of
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Induction/Projection.lean`: the tensor product of the induction
statement is replaced by the internal hom of `Rep k H`, and induction by coinduction. Where the
projection formula says that induction is a map of modules over the representation ring, this one
says that coinduction commutes with the internal hom of `Rep k H` in its covariant variable.

Mathlib has the adjunction `Rep.resCoindAdjunction` and its hom-set equivalence
`Rep.resCoindHomEquiv`, which are this formula after taking `H`-invariants of both sides: an
invariant vector of `Hom(B, Coind_φ A)` is a morphism `B ⟶ Coind_φ A`, and an invariant vector of
`Coind_φ (Hom(Res_φ B, A))` is a morphism `Res_φ B ⟶ A`, sitting there as a constant function. The
isomorphism of representations itself is not upstream, and it is not a formal consequence of the
adjunction: `Representation.coind` is carved out of the functions `H → A`, so the map has to be
produced by hand and shown to land in the equivariant ones. That is what this file does, over an
arbitrary commutative semiring, for a homomorphism of groups rather than only a subgroup inclusion.

The two directions are

`F ↦ (b ↦ (h ↦ F h (τ h b)))`,  `Φ ↦ (h ↦ (b ↦ Φ (τ h⁻¹ b) h))`,

writing `τ` for the representation on `B`. The twist by `τ h` is forced, exactly as the twist by
`τ h⁻¹` is forced in the projection formula. A vector of `Coind_φ (Hom(Res_φ B, A))` is a function
`F : H → (B →ₗ[k] A)` with `F (φ g * h) = ρ g ∘ₗ F h ∘ₗ τ (φ g)⁻¹`, while a vector of
`Hom(B, Coind_φ A)` is a linear map in `b` whose values obey the *untwisted* equivariance
`Φ b (φ g * h) = ρ g (Φ b h)`. Feeding `τ h b` into `F h` is what cancels the `τ (φ g)⁻¹` against
the group coordinate, and it is also what makes the map `H`-equivariant, since `H` acts on
`Coind_φ A` by `(h₀ • f) h = f (h * h₀)` and on `Hom(B, C)` by conjugation.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.coindProjection`: **the dual projection formula**,
  `Rep.coind φ ((Rep.ihom (Rep.res φ Y)).obj X) ≅ (Rep.ihom Y).obj (Rep.coind φ X)` in `Rep k H`.
* `EpsilonEridani.coindProjectionEquiv`, `EpsilonEridani.coindProjectionLEquiv`: the same isomorphism as an
  equivalence of `Representation`s and as a `k`-linear equivalence of the underlying modules, built
  from the two explicit maps `EpsilonEridani.coindProjectionHom` and `EpsilonEridani.coindProjectionInv`.
* `EpsilonEridani.coindProjectionNatIso`: the dual projection formula as a natural isomorphism of functors
  `Rep k G ⥤ Rep k H` in the coinduced variable.
* `EpsilonEridani.coindConst`: an intertwiner `Res_φ B ⟶ A`, viewed as the constant function in
  `Coind_φ (Hom(Res_φ B, A))`.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.coindProjectionHom_apply_coe`, `EpsilonEridani.coindProjectionInv_apply_coe`: the two `k`-linear
  maps, evaluated at a group element. Every proof below goes through these two rules rather than
  through the definitions.
* `EpsilonEridani.coindProjection_hom_hom_toLinearMap`, `EpsilonEridani.coindProjection_inv_hom_toLinearMap`: the
  two directions of the `Rep k H` isomorphism are the two `k`-linear maps above.
* `EpsilonEridani.coindProjection_hom_naturality` and `EpsilonEridani.coindProjectionNatIso`: naturality in the
  coinduced variable.
* `EpsilonEridani.resCoindToHom_eq_coindProjectionHom`: **the comparison with Mathlib's adjunction.** The
  dual projection formula carries the constant function at an intertwiner `f : Res_φ B ⟶ A` to the
  adjunct `Rep.resCoindToHom φ B A f` of Mathlib's `Res ⊣ Coind` adjunction, so the hom-set
  bijection of `Rep.resCoindAdjunction` is the restriction of the formula to the constant vectors.
  The adjunction is therefore consumed by the formula, not reproved by it.

## Implementation notes

Both directions are assembled from `LinearMap.pi`, `LinearMap.proj` and `LinearMap.codRestrict`, so
that linearity in the module variable holds by construction and only the equivariance conditions
have to be checked. The evaluation lemmas are stated on the underlying function of a submodule
element (`.1 h`), matching Mathlib's own `Representation.coindMap_coe_apply_apply`.

The equivariance of `EpsilonEridani.coindProjectionEquiv` is proved by `congrArg` against a stated
cancellation `τ (h * h₀) ∘ₗ τ h₀⁻¹ = τ h` rather than by rewriting the goal. Mathlib's `@[simps]`
output for `Representation.coind` stops at the `LinearMap.restrict` carrying the action, and
rewriting through that restriction leaves the goal ill-typed at `implicit` transparency; both sides
are already definitionally the displayed formulas, so supplying the one genuine equation is enough.

`EpsilonEridani.coindProjection_hom_naturality` is the one statement here that is left to definitional
equality. Mathlib exposes no evaluation rule for the action of `Rep.ihom` on morphisms:
`Rep.ihom_map` states the value as a `Rep.ofHom`, and `Rep.hom_ofHom` cannot strip it because
`(Rep.ihom A).obj B` is not syntactically of the form `Rep.of _`, so `simp` gets no further than the
`Rep.ofHom` on either side. The comparison `EpsilonEridani.resCoindToHom_eq_coindProjectionHom`, by
contrast, does have an evaluation rule upstream (`Rep.resCoindToHom_hom_apply_coe`) and is proved
through it.

The formula is contravariantly functorial in `B` as well; Mathlib packages that variance of the
internal hom as `CategoryTheory.MonoidalClosed.internalHom`, built from the mates construction
`MonoidalClosed.pre`. The naturality recorded here is the covariant one, in the `Rep k G` argument,
which is the variable the functorial statement `coindProjectionNatIso` is about.

The `Representation`-level constructions are universe-polymorphic in `k`, `G`, `H` and the two
carrier modules, and ask only for a commutative semiring and additive commutative monoids. The
`Rep k H` layer keeps the source group `G` free but places `H` and both carrier modules in the
universe of `k`, and needs a commutative ring because `Rep` does: `Rep.coind φ` raises the module
universe by that of `H`, and `Rep.ihom` compares its result with a representation of `H` in a
single universe.

formula "and its dual" as isomorphisms of representations. See C. W. Curtis, I. Reiner, *Methods of
