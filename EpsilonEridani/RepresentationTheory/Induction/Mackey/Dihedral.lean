# Inducing a linear character from the rotation subgroup of a dihedral group

The dihedral group `DihedralGroup n` has a rotation subgroup of index `2`, cyclic and so
commutative by `EpsilonEridani.dihedralRotationsMulEquiv`, and every representation induced from it has
twice the dimension it was induced from. Inducing a **linear** character `ψ` of the rotations
therefore produces a two-dimensional representation, and this file settles, over an algebraically
closed field of characteristic zero, when it is irreducible: exactly when `ψ` is not its own
inverse.

The criterion is the Mackey criterion for a linear character of an inverted subgroup of index two,
`EpsilonEridani.simple_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_iff_of_conj_eq_inv`: the rotation subgroup is inverted
by every reflection (`EpsilonEridani.conj_eq_inv_of_notMem_dihedralRotations`), so the condition left is
the single `ψ ≠ ψ⁻¹`, that some value of `ψ` is not a square root of `1`. That condition is not only
sufficient but necessary, so the result is an `iff`.

The concrete instance carried out below is `n = 4`: the character sending the rotation `r 1` of
`D₄` to `i` has `ψ(r 1)² = -1 ≠ 1`, so it induces a two-dimensional irreducible representation
of `D₄` over `ℂ`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.dihedralGroupFourRotationChar`: a faithful linear character of the rotation subgroup
  of `D₄`, sending `r 1` to `i`.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.simple_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_dihedralRotations_iff`: **over an algebraically
  closed field of characteristic zero, inducing a linear character of the rotation subgroup is
  irreducible exactly when the character is not its own inverse.**
* `EpsilonEridani.finrank_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_dihedralRotations`: the induced representation is
  two-dimensional, over any field.
* `EpsilonEridani.dihedralGroupFourRotationChar_injective`: that character of `D₄` is faithful.
* `EpsilonEridani.simple_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_dihedralGroupFourRotationChar`: **the representation
  of `D₄` over `ℂ` induced from that faithful linear character is irreducible**, the Mackey
  criterion certifying it.
* `EpsilonEridani.finrank_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_dihedralGroupFourRotationChar`: it is
  two-dimensional; with the previous statement this is the two-dimensional irreducible of `D₄`.

## Implementation notes

`EpsilonEridani.dihedralRotationChar`, the character of the rotation subgroup attached to an `n`-th root
of unity, is pure group theory and lives with the rotation subgroup in
`EpsilonEridani.GroupTheory.SpecificGroups.Dihedral.Character`; only its consequences for induced
representations are here.

The irreducibility criterion is stated over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero,
which is what `EpsilonEridani.simple_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_iff_of_conj_eq_inv` asks for, and its
coefficient field is moreover constrained to `Type` rather than `Type*`, that criterion placing
the field and the group in a common universe and `DihedralGroup n` living in `Type`. The dimension
count asks for neither: it holds over any field, in any universe.
