# Induction from the inertia group preserves lying over

For a normal subgroup `N` of `G`, an `N`-representation `V`, and its inertia group `inertia V`,
this file specialises `FDRep.LiesOver.indFDRep` to induction from `inertia V` to `G`: inducing a
representation of `inertia V` lying over `V` gives a representation of `G` that still lies over
`V`.  This is the "lies over" half of the forward map in the Clifford correspondence; the
irreducibility half is `FDRep.simple_indFDRep_of_inertia`.

## Main statements

* `FDRep.liesOver_indFDRep_of_inertia`: the inertia-group specialization of
  `FDRep.LiesOver.indFDRep`.

## References

* I. M. Isaacs, *Character Theory of Finite Groups*, Theorem 6.11.
