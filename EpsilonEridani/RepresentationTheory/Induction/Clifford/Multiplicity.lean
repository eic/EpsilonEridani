# The constituents of a restriction to a normal subgroup share one hom-space dimension

Let `N` be a normal subgroup of `G` and let `ρ` be an irreducible representation of `G` on `V`.
Restricting `ρ` to `N` breaks it into irreducible constituents, and
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Induction/Clifford/Orbit/Basic.lean` identifies *which* constituents
occur: they are the translates `EpsilonEridani.Representation.conjSubrep ρ g σ` of any one of them, so they
form a single `G`-orbit.  This file supplies the other half of Clifford's theorem: they all have hom
spaces of **one common dimension**, which over a splitting field is their common multiplicity.

The quantity compared throughout is `Module.finrank k (S →ₗ[k[N]] M)`.  It is the classical
multiplicity of a simple `k[N]`-module `S` in `M` only when `k` splits `S`: in general it is the
multiplicity times `Module.finrank k` of the division ring `End_{k[N]}(S)`.  Accordingly
`EpsilonEridani/RingTheory/Semisimple/Multiplicity.lean` identifies it with a count of the factors
isomorphic to `S` only for an algebraically closed `k`, a finite-dimensional `S` and a *finite*
decomposition of `M`, the case in which that division ring is `k` itself.  Everything below instead
compares two such dimensions for two constituents of the *same* restriction, and that comparison is
a transport statement rather than a counting one: it needs no decomposition of the restriction, no
algebraically closed field and no finiteness, so no such hypothesis is imposed, and the statements
say only that the dimensions agree.  Whenever `ρ` is irreducible and `V` is finite-dimensional the
restriction is semisimple (`EpsilonEridani.Representation.isSemisimpleRepresentation_comp_subtype`), so
there is a decomposition to count there; if in addition `k` splits the constituents, the common
dimension produced below is literally the classical multiplicity `e`.

What makes the transport work is the one identity Clifford theory runs on, `ρ g ∘ ρ n = ρ (g n g⁻¹)
∘ ρ g` (`EpsilonEridani.Representation.apply_conjNormal_inv`, read in the other direction).  On the
restriction viewed as a module over `k[N]`, it says that translation by `ρ g`
(`Representation.asModuleConjEquiv`) is not `k[N]`-linear but **semilinear over the conjugation
automorphism** `MonoidAlgebra.conjNormalAlgAut k N g` of `k[N]`
(`Representation.asModuleConjEquiv_smul`).  A single semilinear map would not act on hom
spaces at all; but conjugating a map `f` -- precomposing with translation by `ρ g` and postcomposing
with translation back by `ρ g⁻¹` -- twists it by `conjNormalAlgAut g` and then by
`conjNormalAlgAut g⁻¹`, and those two twists cancel.  So `Representation.conjHom` really does land
in `k[N]`-linear maps, and it is a `k`-linear isomorphism of hom spaces
(`Representation.conjHomEquiv`).

Combining the transport with the single-orbit theorem gives the common dimension: any two minimal
`N`-stable subspaces are translates of one another up to isomorphism, so their hom spaces have equal
dimension.  The same argument on the subspaces themselves, where the twist is invisible because only
the `k`-action is retained, shows that all the constituents have the same **dimension** as well;
there it is `EpsilonEridani.Representation.conjSubrepEquiv` from `Clifford/Basic.lean` that does the work.

## Main definitions

* `Representation.asModuleConjEquiv`: translation by `ρ g`, as a `k`-linear automorphism of the
  restriction to `N` viewed as a `k[N]`-module.
* `Representation.conjSubrepMap`: translation restricted to a pair of `N`-subrepresentations that
  it maps into one another.
* `Representation.conjHom`, `Representation.conjHomₗ` and `Representation.conjHomEquiv`: the
  induced transport of hom spaces, as a function, as a `k`-linear map, and as a `k`-linear
  isomorphism.

## Main statements

* `Representation.asModuleConjEquiv_smul`: translation is semilinear over
  `MonoidAlgebra.conjNormalAlgAut`.
* `Representation.finrank_linearMap_conjSubrep` and `Representation.finrank_asSubmodule_conjSubrep`:
  a translate has a hom space of the same dimension, and is itself of the same dimension.
* `Representation.finrank_linearMap_eq_of_isAtom`: **Clifford's theorem, multiplicity form** -- any
  simple `k[N]`-submodule of the restriction of an irreducible representation has a hom space of
  the same dimension as that of a given minimal `N`-stable subspace;
  `Representation.finrank_linearMap_eq_of_isAtom_of_isAtom` is the form comparing two minimal
  `N`-stable subspaces.  Over a splitting field this says that the constituents occur with the same
  multiplicity.
* `Representation.finrank_asSubmodule_eq_of_isAtom_of_isAtom`: they also all have the same
  dimension.
* `Representation.finrank_linearMap_pos` and `Representation.exists_forall_finrank_linearMap_eq`:
  over a finite-dimensional `V` that common dimension is a positive natural number `e`, which over
  a splitting field is the `e` of the classical statement `Res_N W ≅ e · ⨁ᵢ {}^{gᵢ} V`.

## Implementation notes

The `k[N]`-module carrying the restriction is `Representation.asModule (ρ.comp N.subtype)`, a type
synonym for `V`, and its constituents are presented as `Subrepresentation.asSubmodule` of atoms of
the lattice of `N`-subrepresentations, exactly as in `Orbit/Basic.lean`; the two presentations are
matched by `Subrepresentation.isSimpleModule_asSubmodule_iff`.  Because the synonym is not
syntactically `V`, translation is packaged as the bundled `asModuleConjEquiv` and not used as the
bare `ρ g`: that is what puts the `k[N]`-scalar actions in the statements below on the type where
they are found.

The declarations here extend Mathlib's `Representation` namespace, so they are declared into it
directly rather than into `EpsilonEridani.Representation`, which would lose dot notation and be rejected by
`scripts/lint-dot-notation.py`.  The transport itself asks only for a commutative base semiring and
an additive commutative monoid; a field enters only where the single-orbit theorem of
`Orbit/Basic.lean` does.

## References

This proves the multiplicity half of the **Clifford's theorem** milestone of Layer 5 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction/README.md`: "its irreducible
`N`-constituents form a single `G`-orbit, all with the same multiplicity `e`".  The remaining part
of that milestone, the packaged decomposition `Res_N W ≅ e · ⨁ᵢ {}^{gᵢ} V` indexed by a transversal
of the inertia group, is not proved here.

The mathematics is the classical argument of C. W. Curtis and I. Reiner, *Representation Theory of
Finite Groups and Associative Algebras*, §49.
