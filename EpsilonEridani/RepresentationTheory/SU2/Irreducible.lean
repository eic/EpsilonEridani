# The symmetric powers of the standard representation of `SU(2)` are irreducible

`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/SU2/Weight.lean` decomposes `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` under the maximal torus: the
monomial basis `EpsilonEridani.SU2.weightBasis` consists of weight vectors, the `d + 1` weights are
pairwise distinct, and consequently a torus-stable subspace is spanned by the weight vectors it
contains.  That is one half of the highest-weight argument; this file supplies the other half and
concludes that `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` is an **irreducible** representation of `SU(2)`, for every `d`.

The torus alone cannot see irreducibility: it is abelian, and every span of weight vectors is
torus-stable.  What breaks the weight vectors apart is a single element of `SU(2)` off the torus.
Fix the rotation `u = !![3/5, -4/5; 4/5, 3/5]`, an element of `SU(2)` **none of whose entries
vanishes**, and let `W ≠ 0` be an invariant subspace.  Then:

* `W` is torus-stable, so it contains some weight vector, `EpsilonEridani.SU2.weightBasis d i`.
* The coordinate of `u · (weight vector)` at the **highest** weight is a product of entries of `u`,
  one for each tensor factor, hence nonzero: the highest weight is indexed by a *constant*
  unordered tuple, and only the constant ordered tuple orders it, so the coordinate is the single
  product `∏ⱼ u₀,ₖⱼ` with no cancellation
  (`SymmetricPower.repr_basis_symmetricPower_tprod_ofFn_const`).  Torus-stability then puts the
  highest weight vector `e₀^d` into `W`.
* `u · e₀^d` is the **pure power** `(u e₀)^d`, and a pure power of a vector with nonzero
  coordinates has *every* coordinate nonzero
  (`SymmetricPower.repr_basis_symmetricPower_tprod_const_ne_zero`); the terms of the coordinate sum
  all coincide, so again nothing cancels.  Torus-stability now puts **every** weight vector into
  `W`, so `W` is everything.

The choice of `u` matters only through the non-vanishing of its four entries, and the rational
rotation is taken to keep that check arithmetic.  It is a device of the proof and stays private to
this file, as `EpsilonEridani.SU2.genericTorus` does in the weight file.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.SU2.isIrreducible_symPower`: `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` is an irreducible representation of `SU(2)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.SU2.nonempty_equiv_symPower_iff`: two of them are equivalent exactly when they have the
  same degree, so the `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` are pairwise inequivalent.

Exhaustion -- that every finite-dimensional irreducible representation of `SU(2)` is one of these
-- is *not* proved here; it is the remaining half of the classification, and is
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/SU2/Exhaustion.lean`.

## References

This is the "the `su2Irrep n` are irreducible, pairwise inequivalent" half of the classification
asked for by the `SU(2)` engine case of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/CompactGroups/README.md`, which insists that the
classification be proved by the weight/highest-weight argument rather than read off Peter-Weyl.

/-- The weight basis is the monomial basis of `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` reindexed by the number of factors equal
to the first standard basis vector; this is `EpsilonEridani.SU2.weightBasis_apply` promoted from the
basis vectors to the basis itself, so that coordinates may be compared. -/

/-! ### The rotated weight vectors have nonzero coordinates -/

/-- **The image of a weight vector has a nonzero coordinate at the highest weight.**  The highest
weight is indexed by a constant unordered tuple, whose only ordering is the constant one, so that
coordinate is a single product of entries of `EpsilonEridani.SU2.mixMatrix`, and no entry vanishes.  The
image itself is of course not a weight vector, only a combination with this coordinate nonzero. -/

/-! ### Irreducibility -/

/-- **The symmetric powers of the standard representation of `SU(2)` are irreducible.**  A nonzero
invariant subspace is torus-stable, hence spanned by the weight vectors it contains.  The image
under the rotation `EpsilonEridani.SU2.mixMatrix` of one of those weight vectors has a nonzero coordinate
at the highest weight, which puts the highest weight vector in the subspace; the image of the
highest weight vector in turn has a nonzero coordinate at *every* weight, which puts every weight
vector in the subspace.  So the subspace is everything.

This is the highest-weight half of the classification of the irreducibles of `SU(2)`; the
character orthonormality of `EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/SU2/Weyl/Orthogonality.lean` validates
it but does not prove it. -/

the same degree, their dimensions `d + 1` being distinct.  With
`EpsilonEridani.SU2.isIrreducible_symPower` this exhibits `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` as a family of pairwise
non-isomorphic irreducibles of `SU(2)`, one in each dimension. -/
