# The characters of the symmetric powers span the class functions of `SU(2)`

`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/SU2/Weyl/Orthogonality.lean` proves that the characters `χ_d` of the
symmetric powers `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` are *orthonormal* against the Weyl density. This file proves the
complementary statement, that nothing else is needed: the `ℂ`-linear span of the `χ_d` is
**uniformly dense in the continuous class functions of `SU(2)`**, and its closure is exactly the
space of continuous class functions.

## The route

The engine is a closed form for the character. `EpsilonEridani.SU2.character_symPower_torusHom_zpow`
computes `χ_d` on the maximal torus as the weight string `∑_{i ≤ d} z^{2i-d}`, and multiplying that
string by `z + z⁻¹ = tr (diag (z, z⁻¹))` telescopes to `χ_{d+1} + χ_{d-1}`. Since both sides are
class functions and every element of `SU(2)` is conjugate into the torus, this recursion holds on
all of `SU(2)` (`EpsilonEridani.SU2.trace_mul_character_symPower`). It is the Chebyshev recursion, so with
the two base cases `χ_0 = 1` and `χ_1 = tr` it gives

`χ_d = U_d (tr / 2)`  (`EpsilonEridani.SU2.character_symPower_eq_chebyshevU_eval`)

for the Chebyshev polynomial `Polynomial.Chebyshev.U` of the second kind. Two things follow at
once: each `χ_d` is *continuous*, being a polynomial in the trace; and, running the recursion the
other way, every *power* of the trace lies in the span of the `χ_d`
(`EpsilonEridani.SU2.pow_symPowerCharacter_one_mem_characterSpan`), so by linearity that span is exactly
the polynomial functions of the trace.

Density is then Weierstrass approximation on the interval `[-2, 2]` of traces. Every element of
`SU(2)` is conjugate to `diag (e^{iθ}, e^{-iθ})` for an angle `θ` of the Weyl chamber `[0, π]`
(`EpsilonEridani.SU2.exists_isConj_torusExp_mem_Icc`), where the trace is `2 cos θ`; since `arccos`
inverts `cos` on that chamber, the continuous function `t ↦ f (diag (e^{i arccos (t/2)}, …))` on
`[-2, 2]` takes at the trace of `g` the value `f g`. Approximating its real and imaginary parts by
real polynomials and substituting the trace therefore approximates `f` uniformly by elements of
the span.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.SU2.symPowerCharacter`: the character of `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` bundled as a continuous function.
* `EpsilonEridani.SU2.characterSpan`: the `ℂ`-linear span of those characters inside `C(SU(2), ℂ)`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.SU2.trace_mul_character_symPower`: the Chebyshev recursion
  `tr · χ_{d+1} = χ_{d+2} + χ_d`, the character shadow of the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of
  `Sym¹ ⊗ Sym^{d+1}`.
* `EpsilonEridani.SU2.character_symPower_eq_chebyshevU_eval`: `χ_d = U_d (tr / 2)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.SU2.continuous_character_symPower`: the characters are continuous.
* `EpsilonEridani.SU2.pow_symPowerCharacter_one_mem_characterSpan`: every power of the trace lies in the
  span of the characters.
* `EpsilonEridani.SU2.exists_mem_characterSpan_norm_sub_lt`: **uniform density.** Every continuous class
  function on `SU(2)` is within any `ε > 0` of an element of the span.
* `EpsilonEridani.SU2.mem_topologicalClosure_characterSpan_iff`: the closure of the span is **exactly**
  the continuous class functions.

## References

This is the completeness half of the "the `{χ_n}` are an orthonormal basis of the class functions
of `SU(2)`" item of the `SU(2)` engine case of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/CompactGroups/README.md`; orthonormality is
`EpsilonEridani.SU2.character_symPower_orthonormal_torusExp`. It is the analytic input to the remaining
item of that engine case, that the `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` exhaust the finite-dimensional irreducibles, which
is *not* proved here: that deduction additionally needs the symmetric powers as continuous unitary
representations, so that the character orthogonality of
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Character/Basic.lean` applies to them.
