# The symmetric powers of the standard representation of `SU(2)`

The candidate irreducible representations of `SU(2)` are the symmetric powers `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` of the
standard representation, of dimension `d + 1`.  This file builds them, as the restriction of the
symmetric powers of the standard representation of `GL₂(ℂ)` along the inclusion of `SU(2)`, and
computes their characters on the maximal torus.

The character computation is the **weight string**: on `diag(z, z⁻¹)` the character of `Symᵈ` is

`z^d + z^{d-2} + ⋯ + z^{-d}`,

each of the `d + 1` weights `d, d-2, …, -d` occurring exactly once.  This is what the
highest-weight classification of the irreducible representations of `SU(2)` runs on, and the
value at the identity is the dimension `d + 1`, the number of those weights.

The route is Layer 1's `EpsilonEridani.char_symPowerRep_diagonal`, which gives the character at a
diagonal matrix as the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial `h_d` in the diagonal entries,
together with its rank-two evaluation `EpsilonEridani.eval_hsymm_fin_two`: the geometric-looking sum
`∑ᵢ x^i y^{d-i}`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.SU2.toGL`: `SU(2)` as a subgroup of `GL₂(ℂ)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.SU2.symPower`: the `d`-th symmetric power of the standard representation of `SU(2)`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.SU2.character_symPower_torusHom` and
  `EpsilonEridani.SU2.character_symPower_torusHom_zpow`: the character of `Symᵈ` on the maximal torus is
  the weight string `∑_{i ≤ d} z^{2i - d}`.
* `EpsilonEridani.SU2.character_symPower_torusExp`: the same in exponential coordinates,
  `∑_{i ≤ d} e^{i(2i - d)θ}`.
* `EpsilonEridani.SU2.finrank_symPower` and `EpsilonEridani.SU2.character_symPower_one`: the dimension, and so
  the character at the identity, is `d + 1`.
