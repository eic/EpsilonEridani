# The Borel structure of `SU(2)`

`SU(2)` carries the subspace topology of the `2 × 2` complex matrices, which makes it a compact
Hausdorff topological group (`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/SU2/Basic.lean`), but no measurable
structure comes with it. This file equips it with its Borel σ-algebra, which is what lets the Haar
measure of a compact group -- and with it the `L²` theory of
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Compact/` -- be applied to `SU(2)`.

The σ-algebra is taken to be `borel SU(2)` by definition, so the `MeasurableSpace` and
`BorelSpace` instances agree by construction and no compatibility lemma is needed.
