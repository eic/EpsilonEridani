# The sign character of a symmetric group

Mathlib's `Equiv.Perm.sign` is valued in `ℤˣ`. Representation theory wants the *linear character*
it induces over a coefficient ring: the homomorphism `Equiv.Perm α →* kˣ` obtained by pushing the
sign forward along `ℤ → k`. That is `EpsilonEridani.signLinearCharacter`, and it is the `sgn` of the
character tables and of the induction examples -- the one-dimensional representation it carries is
`FDRep.ofLinearCharacter (signLinearCharacter k α)`, and restricting it along a subgroup inclusion
is precomposition, so a subgroup meets it as `(signLinearCharacter k α).comp H.subtype`.

Only two facts are needed to compute with it, and both are recorded here: its value in `k` is the
sign cast into `k`, and it sends a transposition to `-1`. In characteristic two those two values
coincide and the character is trivial; every statement that needs it to be nontrivial has to say so
by excluding that characteristic.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.signLinearCharacter`: the sign of a permutation, as a linear character valued in `kˣ`.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.coe_signLinearCharacter_apply`: its value in `k` is the sign of the permutation, cast.
* `EpsilonEridani.signLinearCharacter_swap`: it sends a transposition to `-1`.
