# The Garnir relations

The polytabloids `e_t` of the `μ`-tableaux span the Specht module `S^μ`, and the standard basis
theorem says that the polytabloids of the *standard* tableaux already do.  The relations that the
straightening algorithm rewrites an arbitrary polytabloid with are the **Garnir relations**, and
this file proves them.

Write `A_X` for the signed sum `∑ sgn(σ) σ` over the permutations `σ` fixing every label outside a
finite set `X` (`EpsilonEridani.antisymmetrizerOn`, defined with the other signed sums in
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Symmetric/Symmetrizer.lean`).  The Garnir relation is

`A_X · e_t = 0`

whenever `X` is too large to be spread over the rows available to it: all the labels of `X` lie in
columns of `μ` of length at most `r`, and `X` has more than `r` elements
(`EpsilonEridani.YoungTableau.asAlgebraHom_antisymmetrizerOn_polytabloid_eq_zero`).  Applied to the
polytabloid it reads as the vanishing of a signed sum of the polytabloids `e_{σt}`
(`EpsilonEridani.YoungTableau.sum_sign_smul_polytabloid_relabel_eq_zero`).

Two facts drive the proof.

* **A signed sum kills whatever an odd permutation in it fixes.**  Absorbing an odd permutation
  supported in `X` turns `A_X` into its own negative, so `A_X` annihilates every vector that
  permutation fixes (`EpsilonEridani.asAlgebraHom_antisymmetrizerOn_apply_eq_zero`).
* **Pigeonhole in the columns.**  A column permutation `q` of `t` moves a label only within its own
  column, so in the tabloid `q · {t}` the labels of `X` still lie in columns of length at most `r`,
  that is, in `r` rows.  As `X` has more than `r` elements, two of them share a row of `q · {t}`,
  and the transposition swapping those two fixes that tabloid.  Every tabloid occurring in `e_t` is
  of this form, so `A_X` kills them all.

The sets `X` the relation is applied to are the **Garnir sets** `EpsilonEridani.YoungTableau.garnirSet t i
j`: the labels of `t` in column `j` from row `i` downwards together with those in column `j + 1`
from row `i` upwards.  As soon as `(i, j + 1)` is a cell of `μ` there are `μ.colLen j + 1` of them
(`EpsilonEridani.YoungTableau.card_garnirSet`) while they occupy only the `μ.colLen j` rows of column `j`,
so the relation applies
(`EpsilonEridani.YoungTableau.asAlgebraHom_antisymmetrizerOn_garnirSet_polytabloid_eq_zero`).
Those are the sets the straightening algorithm uses at a cell `(i, j)` where the rows of the
tableau fail to increase.  Their two halves are described here as well:
`EpsilonEridani.YoungTableau.garnirSetLeft` names the column-`j` half, and a permutation supported in the
set preserves the columns of `t` exactly when it maps that half onto itself
(`EpsilonEridani.YoungTableau.mem_colSubgroup_iff_image_garnirSetLeft_eq`), which is the classical
description of the permutations internal to the halves as a product of two symmetric groups.

The straightening step itself is *not* proved here, and the relation as stated does not supply it.
The permutations `σ` supported in `X` that lie in the column group of `t` satisfy
`e_{σt} = sgn(σ) e_t`, so their terms in the signed sum are further copies of `e_t` rather than of
anything nearer to standard; simply isolating the identity term of the sum therefore rewrites `e_t`
in terms of itself.  The classical Garnir *element* avoids this by summing only over a transversal
of the permutations internal to the two halves of the set, so that `A_X` factors as the signed sum
over those internal permutations times the Garnir element, and the identity coset contributes `e_t`
alone.  That repackaging is left to the file that performs the straightening induction; here the
relation is proved, and stated, for the whole of `A_X`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.YoungTableau.garnirSet`: the Garnir set of a tableau at a row and a column.
* `EpsilonEridani.YoungTableau.garnirSetLeft`: its column-`j` half.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.YoungTableau.exists_ne_rowIndex_relabel_eq`: the pigeonhole step, two labels of an
  oversized set share a row after any column permutation.
* `EpsilonEridani.YoungTableau.asAlgebraHom_antisymmetrizerOn_polytabloid_eq_zero`: **the Garnir
  relation**.
* `EpsilonEridani.YoungTableau.sum_sign_smul_polytabloid_relabel_eq_zero`: the relation as the
  vanishing of a signed sum of polytabloids.
* `EpsilonEridani.YoungTableau.card_garnirSet`: a Garnir set has one more element than the column it
  straddles has cells.
* `EpsilonEridani.YoungTableau.asAlgebraHom_antisymmetrizerOn_garnirSet_polytabloid_eq_zero`: the Garnir
  relation at a Garnir set.
* `EpsilonEridani.YoungTableau.mem_colSubgroup_iff_image_garnirSetLeft_eq`: the permutations of a Garnir
  set internal to its halves are those preserving its left half.
