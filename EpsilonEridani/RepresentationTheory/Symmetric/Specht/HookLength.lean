# The hook-length formula for the degrees of the irreducible representations of `Sₙ`

The Specht modules `S^μ` are the irreducible rational representations of `Sₙ`, and the standard
polytabloids are a basis of `S^μ`, so `dim_ℚ S^μ` is the number `f^μ` of standard Young tableaux
of shape `μ` (`EpsilonEridani.finrank_spechtModule`).  The hook-length formula
(`EpsilonEridani.standardCount_mul_prod_hookLength`) computes that number from the shape alone.  This
file transports the combinatorial statement to the representation it counts:

`dim_ℚ S^μ · ∏_{c ∈ μ} hookLength μ c = n !`,

and reads off the quotient form `dim_ℚ S^μ = n ! / ∏ hooks`, over `ℕ` and over `ℚ`.

Nothing new is proved about Specht modules here; the content is the identification of the two
sides, which needs `EpsilonEridani.card_diagramOf` to see the Young diagram of a partition of `n` as a
diagram with `n` cells.  The shapes are written as `EpsilonEridani.diagramOf μ` throughout, matching
`EpsilonEridani.finrank_spechtModule`, because the hook lengths are attached to the diagram and not to
the partition.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.finrank_spechtModule_mul_prod_hookLength`: **the hook-length formula for the dimension
  of a Specht module**, in multiplicative form.
* `EpsilonEridani.finrank_spechtModule_eq_factorial_div_prod_hookLength` and
  `EpsilonEridani.cast_finrank_spechtModule_eq_factorial_div_prod_hookLength`: its quotient form, over
  `ℕ` and over `ℚ`.

/-- **The hook-length formula for the dimension of a Specht module.** The degree of the
irreducible rational representation `S^μ` of `Sₙ`, times the product of the hook lengths of the
shape `μ`, is `n !`.

Equivalently, the degree of `S^μ` is the number of standard Young tableaux of shape `μ`. The
quotient form `dim_ℚ S^μ = n ! / ∏ hooks` is
`EpsilonEridani.finrank_spechtModule_eq_factorial_div_prod_hookLength`. -/

/-- **The hook-length formula in quotient form**: the degree of `S^μ` is `n !` divided by the
product of the hook lengths of the shape `μ`. The division is exact, by
`YoungDiagram.prod_hookLength_dvd_factorial` at the shape `EpsilonEridani.diagramOf μ`, which has `n`
cells. -/
