# Irreducible characters are linearly independent

Let `G` be a finite group and `k` an algebraically closed field in which `|G|` is invertible.
The characters of pairwise inequivalent irreducible representations of `G` are orthonormal for
`EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.characterPairing`, by Mathlib's first orthogonality relation. A family
that is orthogonal for a bilinear form and has nonzero self-pairings is linearly independent, so
those characters are linearly independent over `k`, both as class functions and as functions
on `G`.

Two consequences follow at once. An irreducible representation is determined by its character:
two irreducibles with the same character are equivalent, since otherwise a self pairing of `1`
would also have to be the cross pairing `0`. And a family of pairwise inequivalent irreducibles
has at most as many members as `G` has conjugacy classes, because the class functions have
exactly that dimension.

That last bound is in fact an equality, and the equality upgrades the linear independence proved
here to a basis of the class functions. Its other half runs through Wedderburn: the blocks of a
presentation of `k[G]` are as many as the conjugacy classes, and each carries an irreducible
representation, distinct blocks carrying inequivalent ones
(`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/BlockRepresentation.lean`). Completeness, the
resulting basis and the second orthogonality relation are proved in
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/Completeness.lean`, downstream of this file; nothing
below uses them.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.linearIndependent_ofCharacter` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.linearIndependent_character`: **the characters of pairwise inequivalent
  irreducible representations are linearly independent**, as class functions and as functions
  on `G`; `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.linearIndependent_ofFDRep` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.linearIndependent_character_fdRep` are the `FDRep` mirrors.
* `Representation.nonempty_equiv_of_character_eq_of_isIrreducible` and
  `FDRep.nonempty_iso_of_character_eq_of_simple`: **an irreducible representation is
  determined by its character**.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.card_le_card_conjClasses` and
  `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.card_le_card_conjClasses_fdRep`: **there are at most as many pairwise
  inequivalent irreducibles as there are conjugacy classes**.
* `EpsilonEridani.Representation.nonempty_equiv_iff_eq`: inside a pairwise inequivalent family, two
  members are equivalent exactly when they are the same member. This one needs neither
  irreducibility nor any hypothesis on `k` and `G`; it is the form in which the
  pairwise-inequivalence hypothesis is used downstream.

## Implementation notes

The pairing enters only through the split orthonormality lemmas of
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/Pairing.lean`, so these statements ask for
`Finite G` and produce the `Fintype` inside their proofs.

## References

* [Character theory roadmap](https://github.com/EpsilonEridaniProject/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/blob/main/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTheory/README.md).
  Everything here is proved from Layer 0's `characterPairing` and its orthonormality, which are on
  `main`, together with Mathlib's `char_orthonormal`; no Layer 1, Layer 2 or Layer 3 material is
  used, and none is presupposed. What the file supplies is prerequisite material for the later
  layers: that a character determines its irreducible is the injectivity of the map
  `character : Irreps k G → ClassFunction k G` that Layer 2.5 asks for, and the cardinality bound
  is the `≤` half of Layer 2's count `Nat.card (Irreps k G) = Nat.card (ConjClasses G)`, obtained
  without Wedderburn. Layer 3's completeness item, the spanning statement and the orthonormal
  basis, is proved downstream in
  `EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/Completeness.lean` from the linear independence
  proved here and the `≥` half of the count.
