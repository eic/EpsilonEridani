# Integrality of class sums

For a finite group `G`, the class sums form a finite basis of the center of the integral
group algebra `ℤ[G]`. Consequently every element of this center, and in particular every
class sum, is integral over `ℤ`.

The point is to establish integrality inside `Z(ℤ[G])`. Integrality of a class sum merely as
an element of `ℤ[G]` would not retain the central algebra through which central characters
factor.

The same statement over an arbitrary coefficient ring `k` follows by base change along
`ℤ[G] → k[G]`, which carries class sums to class sums; it cannot be proved by the argument over
`ℤ`, because `Z(k[G])` need not be a finite `ℤ`-module. This coefficient-general form is the one a
central character `Z(k[G]) →ₐ[k] k` can be applied to, so it is what makes the values of a central
character on the class sums algebraic integers.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isIntegral_classSum`: a class sum is integral over `ℤ` in `Z(ℤ[G])`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isIntegral_classSumCenter`: its base change, integrality over `ℤ` in `Z(k[G])` for an
  arbitrary commutative coefficient ring `k`.

/-- A class sum is integral over `ℤ` as an element of the center of `k[G]`, for any coefficient
ring `k`.

The center of `k[G]` is not a finite `ℤ`-module, so this does not follow by the argument over `ℤ`;
it is transported from there along the base change `ℤ[G] → k[G]`, which carries class sums to class
sums. It is the input to the integrality of the values of a central character on the class
sums. -/
