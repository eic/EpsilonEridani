# The class-multiplication matrices of a finite group

The centre of the group algebra `k[G]` of a finite group has the class sums `K_C` as a `k`-basis
(`EpsilonEridani.classSumBasis`), and multiplication in that basis is described by the structure constants
`aᵢⱼₖ` (`EpsilonEridani.structureConstant`). This file records the matrices of that multiplication.

The **class-multiplication matrix** `classMultMatrix Cᵢ` is the integer matrix with entries
`(Mᵢ)ⱼₖ = aᵢₖⱼ`. The index order is not an accident: it makes `Mᵢ` exactly the matrix of left
multiplication by `K_{Cᵢ}` on the centre, taken in the class-sum basis, which is Mathlib's
`Algebra.leftMulMatrix`. That identification (`EpsilonEridani.classMultMatrix_map_intCast`) is the content
of the file, and everything else follows from it:

* `EpsilonEridani.classMultMatrix_commute`: the matrices `Mᵢ` commute pairwise, because the centre is a
  commutative ring and `Algebra.leftMulMatrix` is an algebra homomorphism;
* `EpsilonEridani.classMultMatrix_injective`: distinct classes give distinct matrices;
* `EpsilonEridani.classMultMatrix_mk_one`: the matrix at the class of `1` is the identity matrix;
* `EpsilonEridani.classMultMatrix_mulVec`: `Mᵢ` acts on the coordinate vector of a central element by
  multiplication by `K_{Cᵢ}`.

Since `EpsilonEridani.structureConstant` is a genuine `def` on `[Fintype G] [DecidableEq G]` data, so is
`classMultMatrix`; these integers and matrices are the whole input to the Burnside--Dixon--Schneider
character-table algorithm. The eigenvector orientation there is pinned, and the index order above is
what pins it: writing `vⱼ = ω(K_{Cⱼ})` for the values of a central character on the class sums, the
row vector `v` is a common **left** eigenvector of the family `{Mᵢ}`, acting from the left via
`Matrix.vecMul` (`ᵥ*`), with `v ᵥ* Mᵢ = ω(K_{Cᵢ}) • v`. It is *not* a column eigenvector under
`Matrix.mulVec` (`*ᵥ`): that convention would require the transposed matrix `aᵢⱼₖ` instead. The `*ᵥ`
action recorded below in `EpsilonEridani.classMultMatrix_mulVec` is a different statement — that `Mᵢ`
carries class-sum coordinates to the coordinates of the product, which is exactly what makes `Mᵢ` a
matrix of left multiplication — and not an eigenvector relation. The eigenvector theorem itself
needs central characters, so it is deferred to the layer that constructs them.
