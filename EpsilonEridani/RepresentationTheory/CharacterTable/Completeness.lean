# Completeness of the irreducible characters, and the second orthogonality relation

Let `G` be a finite group and `k` an algebraically closed field in which `|G|` is invertible. The
characters of pairwise inequivalent irreducible representations of `G` are orthonormal, hence
linearly independent, and there are at most as many of them as `G` has conjugacy classes
(`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/Independence.lean`). This file supplies the matching
lower bound and everything it unlocks.

The lower bound comes from the Wedderburn presentation of `k[G]`: its blocks are indexed by the
conjugacy classes and each carries an irreducible representation, pairwise inequivalent
(`EpsilonEridani.exists_irreducible_family_conjClasses`). A family of that size therefore has linearly
independent characters in a space of exactly that dimension, so **the characters are a basis of the
class functions**: this is completeness, and `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.le_span_irreducibleCharacters`
is the spanning statement it amounts to.

Expanding a class function in that basis is easy because the basis is orthonormal for
`EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.characterPairing`: the coefficient of `χᵢ` in `f` is `⟨χᵢ, f⟩`, so a class
function is determined by its pairings with the `χᵢ`. Applying the expansion to the indicator
function of a conjugacy class, whose pairings are computed by
`EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.characterPairing_classIndicator_inv`, gives the **second (column)
orthogonality relation** `|C_g| · ∑ᵢ χᵢ(g) χᵢ(h⁻¹) = |G|` or `0` according as `g` and `h` are
conjugate or not.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.basisOfIrreducibleCharacters`: **the characters of a family of pairwise
  inequivalent irreducible representations indexed by as many indices as `G` has conjugacy classes
  form a basis of the class functions**, with `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.exists_basis_ofCharacter` the
  statement that such a family exists.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.le_span_irreducibleCharacters`: **completeness**, in the form that every
  class function lies in the span of the irreducible characters.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.sum_characterPairing_smul_ofCharacter`: the expansion of a class function
  in that basis, with coefficients the pairings against the irreducible characters, and
  `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.eq_of_forall_characterPairing_ofCharacter_eq` the consequence that a class
  function is determined by those pairings.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.exists_nonempty_equiv`: **such a family is a complete list of the
  irreducibles**, every irreducible representation being equivalent to one of its members.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.card_conjClass_mul_sum_char_mul_char_inv`: **the second orthogonality
  relation**, in a form free of division, and `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.sum_char_mul_char_inv` in the
  quotient form `|G| / |C_g|`.

## Implementation notes

The irreducibles are produced on the coordinate spaces `Fin n → k` rather than as simple objects of
`FDRep k G`, because a Wedderburn block is a matrix algebra acting on its column space, and because
`FDRep k G` carries only representations on types in the universe of `k`. The
`Representation`-level statements are the ones the rest of the theory uses; a consumer holding a
simple object of `FDRep k G` reaches them through `FDRep.simple_iff_isIrreducible`.

## References

This implements the completeness and second-orthogonality items of Layer 3 of the
[character theory roadmap](https://github.com/EpsilonEridaniProject/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/blob/main/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTheory/README.md),
at the `Representation` level. Its `Suggested.lean` pins them as `irreducibleCharacters_span`, over
the simple objects of `FDRep k G`, and `char_column_orthogonality`, over the `ℂ`-valued character
table; the statements below are the prerequisites those two are read off from, and neither roadmap
name is claimed here. Reading `irreducibleCharacters_span` off from
`EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.le_span_irreducibleCharacters` needs two further steps: the dictionary
`FDRep.simple_iff_isIrreducible` between `CategoryTheory.Simple` in `FDRep k G` and
`Representation.IsIrreducible`, which lives in `EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Simple.Basic` and which
this file does not import, and a comparison of the two spanning sets, which is not done here.

unless `G` is abelian.

This is the `Representation`-level form, spanning by the characters of the irreducible
representations on the coordinate spaces `Fin n → k` that the Wedderburn blocks produce. It is a
prerequisite for, and not the same statement as, the roadmap's `irreducibleCharacters_span`, which
spans by the characters of the simple objects of `FDRep k G`: passing between the two needs
`FDRep.simple_iff_isIrreducible` and a comparison of the two spanning sets, which is not
