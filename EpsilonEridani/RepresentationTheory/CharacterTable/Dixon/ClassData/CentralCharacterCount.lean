# Counting the modular central-character search

`EpsilonEridani.ClassData.centralCharacterSearch` is the executable simultaneous eigenvalue search of the
Burnside--Dixon--Schneider algorithm: it returns the `Finset` of normalized common left eigenrows of
the reduced class-multiplication matrices. `EpsilonEridani.ClassData.mem_centralCharacterSearch` says what
its elements are; it does not say **how many** there are, and without that the algorithm cannot know
that it has found every central character rather than a proper subset of them.

This file supplies the count. Over a coefficient field that splits the centre of the group algebra
into coordinates, the search returns exactly `r` rows, `r` the number of conjugacy classes. The
splitting hypothesis is essential and not automatic: over a field too small to contain the relevant
roots of unity some characters of `Z(F[G])` take values in a proper extension of `F` and are simply
invisible to a search carried out over `F`, so the search would come back short. At a good Dixon
prime the good-prime structure theorem
`EpsilonEridani.IsGoodDixonPrime.nonempty_center_algEquiv_conjClasses` supplies exactly that hypothesis
over `ZMod p`, which is what makes the modular phase of the algorithm lossless.

The argument is a chain of transports and one genuinely new input. Splitting the centre turns its
characters into the coordinate evaluations of a finite power of `F`, and those are in bijection with
the coordinates (`Pi.evalAlgHomEquiv`); the class-algebra dictionary
`EpsilonEridani.algHomEquivEigenrow` turns characters into normalized class-indexed eigenrows; and
`EpsilonEridani.ClassData.modularEigenrowEquiv` renumbers those into the numbered rows the executable
search returns.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ClassData.nonempty_conjClasses_equiv_centralCharacterSearch`: under a splitting
  hypothesis, there exists a non-canonical bijection between the conjugacy classes and the returned
  rows.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassData.card_centralCharacterSearch`: the executable search returns `d.numClasses`
  rows over any coefficient field splitting the centre, and
  `EpsilonEridani.ClassData.card_centralCharacterSearch_of_isGoodDixonPrime` reads that off a good Dixon
  prime.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassData.centralCharacterSearch_nonempty`: the trivial central character ensures that
  the search is nonempty over any coefficient field, without a splitting hypothesis.
* `EpsilonEridani.ClassData.centralCharacterSearch_eq_rowsOfMap`: a complete set of candidate
  normalized eigenrows exhausts the search, and
  `EpsilonEridani.ClassData.centralCharacterSearch_eq_rowsOfMap_of_isGoodDixonPrime` reads that
  off a good Dixon prime.

## Implementation notes

The general results are stated over an arbitrary finite coefficient field `F` with the splitting of
the centre as an explicit hypothesis, rather than over `ZMod p` with a good Dixon prime: the
splitting is the only thing the count uses, and stating it that way keeps the argument free of the
arithmetic conditions in `EpsilonEridani.IsGoodDixonPrime`, which enter only through
`EpsilonEridani.ClassData.card_centralCharacterSearch_of_isGoodDixonPrime`.

## References

This is the cardinality result Layer 6 of the
[character theory roadmap](https://github.com/EpsilonEridaniProject/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/blob/main/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTheory/README.md)
asks of "The good-prime structure theorem": that the reduced class-multiplication matrices have
exactly `r` distinct algebra homomorphisms. This count is an input to the subsequent refinement of
the eigenvector search into one-dimensional common eigenspaces.

/-- **When the coefficient field splits the centre of `F[G]`, there exists a bijection between the
conjugacy classes and the rows returned by the executable search.** The bijection is non-canonical
and records only the equality of the two cardinalities; it does not associate a specified row to a
given conjugacy class. -/

Together with `EpsilonEridani.ClassData.mem_centralCharacterSearch`, which says that every returned row is
a normalized common left eigenrow, this is what tells the Burnside--Dixon--Schneider algorithm that
the search has found *all* the central characters: the rows it returns are central characters, and
there are as many of them as there are irreducible representations to account for. -/
