# Class data for the dihedral groups

`EpsilonEridani.ClassData` needs a concrete enumeration of the group to start from, since `Finset.toList`
is noncomputable; `EpsilonEridani.dihedralElements` is that enumeration for `DihedralGroup n`. This file
feeds it to `EpsilonEridani.ClassData.ofList` and works the dihedral groups of orders `6` and `8` as closed
instances of the executable class-data API: their numbers of classes, class sizes, and full arrays
of structure constants are all evaluated by the kernel with `decide`. Stating the acceptance tests
as `decide`-checked theorems rather than as `#eval`s is what makes CI check the values instead
of merely printing them.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.dihedralClassData`: the class data of `DihedralGroup n`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.numClasses_dihedralClassData_three`,
  `EpsilonEridani.card_classFinset_dihedralClassData_three` and
  `EpsilonEridani.structureConstantTable_dihedralClassData_three`: the class count, class sizes, and
  structure constants of the dihedral group of order `6`, evaluated by the kernel.
* `EpsilonEridani.numClasses_dihedralClassData_four`,
  `EpsilonEridani.card_classFinset_dihedralClassData_four` and
  `EpsilonEridani.structureConstantTable_dihedralClassData_four`: the class count, the class sizes, and
  the structure constants of the dihedral group of order `8`, evaluated by the kernel.

## References

These kernel-evaluated, `decide`-checked acceptance tests on `DihedralGroup 3` and
`DihedralGroup 4` supply the computations requested by Layer 6 of the
[character theory roadmap](https://github.com/EpsilonEridaniProject/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/blob/main/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTheory/README.md).

`decide` statements about the class data of a concrete dihedral group. -/

/-- **The five conjugacy classes of the dihedral group of order `8` have sizes `1, 1, 2, 2, 2`.**
The order is the one `EpsilonEridani.ClassData.ofList` produces from `EpsilonEridani.dihedralElements`, with
representatives `1`, `r²`, `sr²`, `r³`, `sr³`: the identity, the central rotation, one pair of
reflections, the pair of rotations of order `4`, and the other pair of reflections. -/

/-- **The structure constants of the dihedral group of order `8`**, computed by the kernel; this
nested list is the entire input the Dixon--Schneider algorithm reads for that group. In the
numbering of `EpsilonEridani.card_classFinset_dihedralClassData_four`, each of the three classes of size
`2` squares to `2K₀ + 2K₁`, and multiplying the class `K₃` of rotations of order `4` by either
class of reflections exchanges the two. -/
