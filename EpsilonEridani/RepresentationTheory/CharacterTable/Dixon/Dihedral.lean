# Dixon prime data for the small dihedral groups

The Burnside--Dixon--Schneider algorithm is meant to run, so the groups it is run on are handed a
prime by hand rather than by the existence theorem `EpsilonEridani.exists_isGoodDixonPrime`, whose witness
is noncomputable. This file certifies the two worked examples: `5` for the dihedral group of order
`8`, with `2` as its primitive fourth root of unity, and `7` for the dihedral group of order `6`,
with `3` as its primitive sixth root.
