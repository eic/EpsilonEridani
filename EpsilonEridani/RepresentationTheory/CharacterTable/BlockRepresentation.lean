# The irreducible representations carried by the Wedderburn blocks

A Wedderburn presentation `e : k[G] ≃ₐ[k] Π i, Matₙᵢ(k)` of a finite group algebra is a numerical
statement until each block is turned into a representation. This file does that: composing `e` with
the projection onto the `i`-th factor and with `Matrix.toLinAlgEquiv'` presents the column space
`Fin (d i) → k` as a `k[G]`-module, hence as a representation of `G`.

Two facts make the resulting family the family of irreducibles. Each `blockRepresentation e i` is
irreducible by `EpsilonEridani.Representation.isIrreducible_of_asAlgebraHom_surjective`, its algebra map
onto `End k (Fin (d i) → k)` being surjective. And the blocks are pairwise inequivalent, because
the idempotent `e.symm (Pi.single i 1)` acts as the identity on the `i`-th block and as zero on
every other one.

Together with `EpsilonEridani.exists_algEquiv_pi_matrix_conjClasses` this produces, over an algebraically
closed field whose characteristic does not divide `|G|`, a family of pairwise inequivalent
irreducible representations of `G` indexed by the conjugacy classes of `G`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.blockAlgHom`: the algebra map from `k[G]` onto the endomorphisms of the `i`-th column
  space cut out by a Wedderburn presentation.
* `EpsilonEridani.blockRepresentation`: the representation of `G` on that column space.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.isIrreducible_blockRepresentation`: **every block of a Wedderburn presentation carries an
  irreducible representation**.
* `EpsilonEridani.isEmpty_equiv_blockRepresentation`: **distinct blocks carry inequivalent
  representations**.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_irreducible_family_conjClasses`: **there are as many pairwise inequivalent
  irreducible representations of `G` as `G` has conjugacy classes**, in the form of a family indexed
  by `ConjClasses G`, whose dimensions have squares summing to `|G|`.

This supplies one half of the block ⇆ irreducible-representation matching that Layer 2.5 of the
[character theory roadmap](https://github.com/EpsilonEridaniProject/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/blob/main/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTheory/README.md)
asks for, in the concrete form needed by Layer 3's completeness statement. See J.-P. Serre, *Linear

Groups*, Chapter 1.
