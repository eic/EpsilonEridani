# The boundary principal series of `GL₂` splits

For a finite field `F` and a multiplicative character `α : Fˣ → ℂˣ`, the principal series at
the repeated parameter `(α, α)` is reducible. This file identifies its two constituents:

```text
Ind_B^GL₂(α ⊗ α) ≅ (α ∘ det) ⊕ ((α ∘ det) ⊗ St).
```

The character identity is the projection formula for induction. The Borel character `α ⊗ α`
is the restriction of the determinant character `α ∘ det`, so its induction is the product of
that character with `Ind_B^GL₂(1)`. The latter is the permutation representation on the
projective line and has character `1 + χ_St`. Distributing the determinant character gives the
characters of `EpsilonEridani.GL2Linear F α` and `EpsilonEridani.GL2SteinbergTwist F α`. Character theory over
`ℂ` then promotes this identity to an isomorphism of representations.

This splitting separates the two boundary families in the character table of `GL₂(F)`: the
linear representations have dimension `1`, while their Steinberg twists have dimension
`Fintype.card F`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.character_GL2PrincipalSeries_self_eq_add`: its two character constituents are the
  linear and Steinberg-twist characters.
* `EpsilonEridani.simple_GL2Steinberg` and `EpsilonEridani.simple_GL2SteinbergTwist`: the Steinberg
  representation and all its determinant twists are irreducible (for universe-small finite
  fields).
* `EpsilonEridani.nonempty_iso_GL2PrincipalSeries_self`: the boundary principal series is the biproduct
  of those two representations.

/-! ### Irreducibility of the constituents

Mathlib's character-norm criterion currently requires the coefficient field and the group in the
same universe. Accordingly the two Steinberg packaging results below use `F : Type`, as does the
existing irreducibility theorem for the non-boundary principal series. The representations, their
splitting, and the irreducibility of the linear constituent all remain universe-polymorphic. -/
