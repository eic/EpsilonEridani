# Class functions on `GL₂(𝔽_q)` are determined by the four normal forms

Over a finite field `F` with a supplied degree-`2` extension `E/F`, every element of `GL₂(F)` is
conjugate to a central scalar, to a split semisimple `diag (a, b)` with `a ≠ b`, to a Jordan block
`!![a, 1; 0, a]`, or to the matrix of multiplication by an element of `E` outside `F`
(`EpsilonEridani.exists_isConj_normalForm`).  A class function is constant on conjugacy classes, so two
class functions agreeing on those four families are equal.

This is the extensionality principle behind every row of the character table of `GL₂(𝔽_q)`: the
character values there are computed at the four normal forms one family at a time, and this is
what turns four such computations into an identity of class functions.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.ClassFunction.ext_gl2NormalForm`: two class functions on `GL₂(F)` agreeing on
  the four normal forms are equal.
