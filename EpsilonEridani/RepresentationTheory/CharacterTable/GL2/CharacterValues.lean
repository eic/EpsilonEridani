# The Steinberg character of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` on the four families of conjugacy classes

`EpsilonEridani.character_GL2Steinberg` computes the Steinberg character of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` at `g` as the
number of points of the projective line fixed by `g`, less one. The conjugacy classes of `GL₂(𝔽_q)`
fall into four families, and
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/ProjectiveLine.lean` counts the fixed points of a
representative of each: `q + 1` for a **central** scalar matrix, `2` for a **split semisimple**
diagonal matrix with distinct entries, `1` for a **non-semisimple** Jordan block, and `0` for an
**elliptic** element of the non-split torus that does not come from `F`. This file reads off the
resulting row of the character table,

`χ_St = q`, `1`, `0`, `-1`

on the four families, together with the row of the boundary principal series
`Ind_B^{GL₂}(1 ⊗ 1) = 1 + χ_St`, which is `q + 1`, `2`, `1`, `0` — the fixed-point counts
themselves, as they must be for a permutation character.

That these four values determine the Steinberg character outright is a statement about the
conjugacy classes, not about the representation: every element of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` is conjugate to one of
the four representatives (`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/ConjugacyClasses.lean`
classifies the classes by trace and determinant, and the elliptic normal form is the one that needs
the quadratic extension), and a character is a class function. That exhaustion is
`EpsilonEridani.exists_isConj_normalForm` of
`EpsilonEridani/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/NormalForm.lean`; it is not invoked here, the
values below being stated at the normal forms themselves.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.character_GL2Steinberg_scalar`, `EpsilonEridani.character_GL2Steinberg_diagGL`,
  `EpsilonEridani.character_GL2Steinberg_jordanGL` and
  `EpsilonEridani.character_GL2Steinberg_gl2NonSplitTorusHom`: the Steinberg character takes the values
  `q`, `1`, `0` and `-1` on the four families.
* `EpsilonEridani.character_GL2PrincipalSeries_one_one_scalar` and its three companions: the character of
  the boundary principal series takes the values `q + 1`, `2`, `1` and `0`.

None of those eight values is a `simp` lemma. `EpsilonEridani.character_GL2Steinberg` is itself `@[simp]`,
so `simp` rewrites the left-hand side of each of them to a fixed-coset count, and then, `F` being
finite, on to a `Fintype.card` by `Nat.card_eq_fintype_card`; so none of the eight is in
`simp`-normal form, and tagging any of them fails the `simpNF` linter.

/-! ### The boundary principal series

At `α = β = 1` the principal series is the permutation representation of the projective line, so
its character is the fixed-point count itself: one more than the Steinberg value. These four
values are the general principal-series row
(`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/PrincipalSeries/CharacterValues.lean`) at the
trivial pair of characters, and are read off it rather than proved a second time. -/
