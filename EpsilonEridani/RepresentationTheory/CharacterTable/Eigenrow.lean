# The eigenrows of the class-multiplication matrices are the central characters

Let `G` be a finite group and `k` an algebraically closed field in which `|G|` is invertible. The
class sums `K_C` are a basis of the centre `Z(k[G])`, and the class-multiplication matrices `Mᵢ`
record multiplication by `K_{Cᵢ}` in that basis. A **normalized common left eigenrow** of the family
`{Mᵢ}` is a function `v` on the conjugacy classes with `v (ConjClasses.mk 1) = 1` and
`v ᵥ* Mᵢ = v Cᵢ • v` for every class; `EpsilonEridani.isClassEigenrow_iff_exists_algHom` identifies these
with the `k`-algebra homomorphisms `Z(k[G]) →ₐ[k] k`, by a computation inside the class algebra that
knows nothing about representations.

This file supplies the representation theory that computation is missing: **those algebra
homomorphisms are exactly the central characters `ωᵪ` of the irreducible representations of `G`**.
Collecting their values on the class sums gives the **central character table**
`EpsilonEridani.centralCharacterTable k G`, the matrix `Ω` of the Burnside--Dixon--Schneider algorithm, and
`EpsilonEridani.isClassEigenrow_iff_exists_centralCharacterTable_eq` says that its rows are precisely the
normalized common left eigenrows. So an eigenrow computed from the structure constants alone is a
central character, and there are exactly as many of them as `G` has conjugacy classes.

The proof runs through a Wedderburn presentation `k[G] ≃ₐ[k] ∏ᵢ Matₙᵢ(k)`. Such a presentation
splits the centre as the product algebra `∏ᵢ k` (`EpsilonEridani.centerMonoidAlgebraAlgEquivPi`), whose
only algebra homomorphisms to `k` are the coordinate evaluations (`AlgHom.eq_piEvalAlgHom`);
the evaluation at a block is the central character of the representation that block carries
(`EpsilonEridani.centralCharacter_blockRepresentation`), and every irreducible representation is equivalent
to a block, hence has the same central character as one.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.centralCharacterTable`: the central character table `Ω` of `G`.
* `EpsilonEridani.finEquivCentralCharacter`: the enumeration of the algebra homomorphisms out of
  `Z(k[G])` by the irreducible representations, and `EpsilonEridani.finEquivEigenrow`, the same for the
  normalized common left eigenrows.
* `EpsilonEridani.basisCentralCharacterTable`: the rows of `Ω`, as a basis of the functions on the
  conjugacy classes.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.exists_centralCharacter_eq`: **every algebra homomorphism out of the centre is a central
  character**, and `EpsilonEridani.centralCharacter_irreducibleRepresentation_injective`: **distinct
  irreducibles have distinct central characters**.
* `EpsilonEridani.isClassEigenrow_iff_exists_centralCharacterTable_eq`: **the normalized common left
  eigenrows of the class-multiplication matrices are exactly the rows of `Ω`**, and
  `EpsilonEridani.card_normalized_isClassEigenrow`: there are as many of them as conjugacy classes. The
  version requiring only a split centre is
  `EpsilonEridani.card_normalized_isClassEigenrow_of_nonempty_center_algEquiv`.
  Dropping the normalization only adds scalar multiples:
  `EpsilonEridani.exists_eq_smul_centralCharacterTable` says **every nonzero common left eigenvector of the
  class-multiplication matrices is a multiple of a row of `Ω`**, and
  `EpsilonEridani.linearIndependent_centralCharacterTable` says those rows are linearly independent, hence
  a basis.
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_of_centralCharacter_eq`: **the central characters separate the points of the centre**.
* `EpsilonEridani.centralCharacterTable_mul_characterDegree`: the conversion `ωᵪ(K_C) · χ(1) = |C| · χ(g)`
  between `Ω` and the ordinary character table `EpsilonEridani.characterTable`, with the two quotient
  forms `EpsilonEridani.centralCharacterTable_eq_div` and `EpsilonEridani.characterTable_eq_div` reading each
  table off the other.

## Implementation notes

The rows of `Ω` are indexed by the same enumeration `EpsilonEridani.finEquivIrreducibleCharacters` of the
irreducible characters as the rows of `EpsilonEridani.characterTable`, so the two tables are aligned row by
row and `EpsilonEridani.centralCharacterTable_mul_characterDegree` converts between them entry by entry.

That conversion is stated without division, so it holds over every algebraically closed field in
which `|G|` is invertible. Dividing it out in either direction needs the corresponding factor to be
invertible: `EpsilonEridani.characterTable_eq_div` divides by the class size `|C|`, which the standing
hypotheses already make invertible, while
`EpsilonEridani.centralCharacterTable_eq_div` divides by the degree `χ(1)` and so takes its nonvanishing
as an explicit hypothesis rather than assuming characteristic zero.

`EpsilonEridani.centralCharacter_blockRepresentation` carries the irreducibility of the block as an
instance argument rather than deriving it: the central character is only defined for an irreducible
representation, and irreducibility of a block is the theorem
`EpsilonEridani.isIrreducible_blockRepresentation`, which mentions the chosen presentation `e` and so
cannot be an instance. Callers supply it with `have := isIrreducible_blockRepresentation e i`.

calls for after `normalized_eigenrow_iff_algHom`: the identification of the algebra homomorphisms
out of the centre with the central characters, and the central table `Ω` itself. See I. M. Isaacs,
