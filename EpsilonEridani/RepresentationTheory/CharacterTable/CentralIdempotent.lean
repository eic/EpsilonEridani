# The primitive central idempotents of a group algebra

Attached to a representation `ρ` of a finite group `G` over a field `k`, with character `χ`, is the
group-algebra element `∑_g χ(g⁻¹) g`, called `EpsilonEridani.Representation.characterSum` here. Because the
character is a class function, this element is a combination of class sums, and it is built as one
by `EpsilonEridani.ofConjClassesCenter`, so its centrality comes for free. An irreducible representation
`σ` therefore sees it as the single scalar recorded by the central character of
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/CentralCharacter.lean`.

Two computations of one trace pin that scalar down. The trace of the action of `∑_g χ(g⁻¹) g` on
`σ` is the scalar times the degree `ψ(1)` on one side and `∑_g χ(g⁻¹) ψ(g)` on the other, which the
orthogonality relations of Mathlib's `Representation.char_orthonormal` evaluate to `|G|` or to `0`
according to whether `ρ` and `σ` are isomorphic. Two consequences follow. Taking `σ = ρ`, the
product of the scalar with the degree `χ(1)` is `|G|`, a unit, so **the degree of an irreducible
representation is itself a unit in `k`**: the characteristic of `k` divides no irreducible degree,
which is what makes dividing by degrees legitimate below. Rescaling then gives the **primitive
central idempotent**

`e_ρ = (χ(1) / |G|) ∑_g χ(g⁻¹) g`,

which acts as the identity on `ρ` and as zero on every irreducible representation not isomorphic to
`ρ`.

The multiplicative identities are obtained coefficient by coefficient rather than through a
Wedderburn decomposition. The coefficient of `x` in `(∑_g χ(g⁻¹) g) · (∑_g ψ(g⁻¹) g)` is
`∑_g χ(g⁻¹) ψ(x⁻¹ g)`, which is exactly the trace of `σ(x⁻¹)` composed with the action of
`∑_g χ(g⁻¹) g` on `σ`; that action is a scalar when `σ` is irreducible, so the trace collapses to a
multiple of `ψ(x⁻¹)`, the coefficient of `x` in `∑_g ψ(g⁻¹) g`. Orthogonality of the idempotents,
and `e_ρ² = e_ρ`, are then read off from the values of the central character.

That the `e_ρ` sum to `1` needs the classification of the irreducible representations indexing that
sum, so it is not proved here but in
`EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/IdempotentDecomposition.lean`, downstream of the
completeness of the irreducible characters.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Representation.characterSum`: the group-algebra element `∑_g χ(g⁻¹) g`, with
  `EpsilonEridani.Representation.characterSumCenter` the same element read in the centre.
* `EpsilonEridani.Representation.primitiveCentralIdempotent`: the element
  `e_ρ = (χ(1) / |G|) ∑_g χ(g⁻¹) g` of an irreducible representation, with
  `EpsilonEridani.Representation.primitiveCentralIdempotentCenter` the same element read in the centre.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.Representation.characterSum_eq_sum`: the character sum is the sum `∑_g χ(g⁻¹) g` over
  the group, with `EpsilonEridani.Representation.characterSum_coeff` its coefficients and
  `EpsilonEridani.Representation.characterSumCenter_eq_sum_classSumCenter` its expansion in the class
  sums, of which `EpsilonEridani.Representation.primitiveCentralIdempotentCenter_eq_sum_classSumCenter`
  is the rescaled form for `e_ρ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Representation.characterSum_mul_characterSum`: multiplying by `∑_g χ(g⁻¹) g` rescales the
  character sum of an irreducible representation by the scalar its central character records.
* `EpsilonEridani.Representation.centralCharacter_characterSumCenter_mul_character_one`: that scalar,
  times the degree, is `|G|` for isomorphic representations and `0` otherwise.
* `EpsilonEridani.Representation.isUnit_char_one`: the degree of an irreducible representation is a unit
  in `k`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Representation.primitiveCentralIdempotent_eq_of_nonempty_equiv`: `e_ρ` depends only on
  the isomorphism class of `ρ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Representation.centralCharacter_primitiveCentralIdempotentCenter`: an irreducible
  representation sees `e_ρ` as `1` or as `0` according to whether it is isomorphic to `ρ`, with
  `EpsilonEridani.Representation.centralCharacter_primitiveCentralIdempotentCenter_self` the diagonal
  case.
* `EpsilonEridani.Representation.asAlgebraHom_primitiveCentralIdempotent`: `e_ρ` acts as the identity on
  `ρ` and as zero on an irreducible representation not isomorphic to `ρ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Representation.primitiveCentralIdempotent_mul_primitiveCentralIdempotent`: the
  idempotents attached to non-isomorphic irreducible representations are orthogonal, with
  `EpsilonEridani.Representation.isIdempotentElem_primitiveCentralIdempotent` the diagonal case and
  `EpsilonEridani.Representation.primitiveCentralIdempotent_ne_zero` their nonvanishing.

Its coefficients `g ↦ χ(g⁻¹)` form a class function, so the element is assembled from the class
sums by `EpsilonEridani.ofConjClassesCenter`, which is where its centrality comes from;
`EpsilonEridani.Representation.characterSum_eq_sum` recovers the formula `∑_g χ(g⁻¹) g`.

Decidability of equality on `G` is only what indexes the class sums, so it is taken classically
rather than being a hypothesis of the definition. -/
