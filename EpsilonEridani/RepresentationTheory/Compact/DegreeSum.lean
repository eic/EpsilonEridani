# Peter-Weyl for a finite group: the matrix-coefficient basis and the sum of the squared degrees

For a compact group `G` the normalized matrix coefficients of a skeleton of the unitary dual are a
*Hilbert* basis of `L²(G)` (`EpsilonEridani.peterWeylBasis`). When `G` is finite and discrete that
statement is an algebraic one, and this file states it as such.

Normalized Haar measure on a finite discrete group has full support, so `L²(G)` *is* the space
`G → 𝕜` of all functions on `G` (`EpsilonEridani.lpHaarProbEquivFun`), of dimension `|G|`. On such a `G`
the Peter-Weyl family is an ordinary module basis — of `L²(G)`, and read through that
identification of `G → 𝕜` itself, so that the matrix coefficients are a basis of the functions on
a finite group. Its index is the type of matrix positions
`Σ π, Fin (dim V_π) × Fin (dim V_π)`, so counting it against the dimension `|G|` gives the degree
identity `∑_π (dim V_π)² = |G|`; run the other way, the same count makes the skeleton itself
finite, a finite group having only finitely many irreducible unitary representations up to
equivalence.

The same identity is proved algebraically, over any algebraically closed field whose characteristic
does not divide `|G|` and indexed by the blocks of the group algebra, from the Wedderburn
decomposition in `EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/Wedderburn.lean`. What is new here is
that the *analytic* Peter-Weyl basis returns it, on the matrix positions of a skeleton of the
unitary dual.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.peterWeylModuleBasis`: the Peter-Weyl family of a skeleton as a module basis of `L²(G)`,
  for finite `G`.
* `EpsilonEridani.peterWeylFunBasis`: the same family read as a basis of `G → 𝕜`, that is, the normalized
  matrix coefficients as a basis of the functions on a finite group.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.IsIrrepSkeleton.finite`: a skeleton of the unitary dual of a finite group is finite.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsIrrepSkeleton.sum_sq_dim_eq_natCard`: **the squares of the degrees sum to the order of
  the group**, `∑_π (dim V_π)² = |G|`.
* `EpsilonEridani.peterWeylFunBasis_apply`: the values of the basis of `G → 𝕜`, the normalized matrix
  coefficients `g ↦ √(dim V_π) · ⟪π g eₐ, e_b⟫`.
* `EpsilonEridani.finite_irrepClass` and `EpsilonEridani.sum_sq_dim_irrepClass_eq_natCard`: the unconditional
  forms, for the canonical skeleton `EpsilonEridani.IrrepClass.model` that
  `EpsilonEridani.isIrrepSkeleton_model` supplies. A `Fintype` instance for the index of the second is
  obtained from the first through `Fintype.ofFinite`.
