# The unitary model of a finite-dimensional representation of a compact group

Weyl's unitarian trick, in `EpsilonEridani/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Unitarizable.lean`, averages the
inner product of a continuous representation `π` of a compact group over Haar measure and records
the averaged form through its Gram operator `S`, a positive-definite self-adjoint operator with
`(π g)† ∘ S ∘ (π g) = S`. That is an invariant form, not yet a unitary representation: Lean fixes
one `InnerProductSpace` structure on the carrier, and `π` is in general not unitary for it.

This file closes the gap in finite dimensions. Changing coordinates by the automorphism `A` that
standardizes the invariant form
(`EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousLinearEquiv_inner_map_map`, morally `A = S ^ (-1 / 2)`) conjugates `π`
into a representation that *is* unitary for the given inner product:

`EpsilonEridani.ContRepresentation.exists_isUnitary_congr` produces `e : V ≃L[𝕜] V` with
`IsUnitary (congr e π)`.

What this buys is a replacement of `π` by an equivalent representation, not by `π` itself, so a
property may be proved for unitary representations alone exactly when it is invariant under
conjugation by a continuous linear automorphism. The two consequences recorded here are the form
that fact is consumed in, and both are of that kind: a matrix coefficient of an arbitrary
finite-dimensional continuous representation is a matrix coefficient of a unitary one, and hence
the representative ring `𝓡(G)` is spanned by the matrix coefficients of the **unitary**
finite-dimensional continuous representations alone.

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.ContRepresentation.exists_isUnitary_congr`: a finite-dimensional continuous
  representation of a compact group is conjugate to a unitary one.
* `EpsilonEridani.ContRepresentation.exists_isUnitary_matrixCoeff_eq`: its matrix coefficients are matrix
  coefficients of a unitary representation.
* `EpsilonEridani.isRepresentative_iff_exists_isUnitary`: a representative function is a matrix
  coefficient of a unitary representation on a standard model.

## Implementation notes

The conjugating automorphism is not asked to be canonical:
`EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousLinearEquiv_inner_map_map` chooses an eigenbasis of the Gram operator,
and only its existence is exported. Nothing downstream needs more, since the unitary structure it
produces is unique up to a unitary equivalence anyway.

Finite dimensionality enters only through that standardization, which is proved by the spectral
theorem; the Gram operator itself is built for an arbitrary Hilbert-space carrier.

This finishes Layer 1 of the
[compact-groups roadmap](https://github.com/EpsilonEridaniProject/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/blob/main/EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/CompactGroups/README.md),
whose statement of the unitarian trick asks that "downstream results may assume `IsUnitary` without
loss of generality". The Layer 5 (Peter-Weyl) completeness argument is the intended consumer: the
matrix coefficients that have to be expanded in the coefficients of a family of irreducible
*unitary* representations are, a priori, coefficients of arbitrary ones. The mathematical
development follows Daniel Bump, *Lie Groups*, second edition, Chapter 2.

/-- **A finite-dimensional continuous representation of a compact group is conjugate to a unitary
one.** There is a continuous linear automorphism `e` of the carrier for which the transported
representation `EpsilonEridani.ContRepresentation.congr e π` preserves the inner product.

This is the unitarian trick in its usable form. Haar averaging supplies the invariant
positive-definite form `⟪S ·, ·⟫`; the automorphism `A` carrying the standard inner product to
that form (`EpsilonEridani.exists_continuousLinearEquiv_inner_map_map`) conjugates the invariance of the
form into unitarity of `A⁻¹ ∘ π · ∘ A`. -/

/-- **A matrix coefficient of a finite-dimensional continuous representation of a compact group is
a matrix coefficient of a unitary one**, on the same carrier and at suitably moved vectors.

Matrix coefficients depend only on the equivalence class of a representation
(`EpsilonEridani.ContRepresentation.matrixCoeff_congr_adjoint`), so the conjugate unitary model produced
by `EpsilonEridani.ContRepresentation.exists_isUnitary_congr` produces every matrix coefficient of the
original. -/

/-- **The representative functions of a compact group are the matrix coefficients of its unitary
finite-dimensional continuous representations.** Restricting the representations allowed in the
definition of `EpsilonEridani.IsRepresentative` to the unitary ones changes nothing.

The forward direction is unitarization; the reverse is the definition. Consequently the
representative ring `𝓡(G)`, whose uniform density in `C(G, 𝕜)` is the analytic core of the
Peter-Weyl theorem, is spanned by the matrix coefficients of unitary representations, which are
the ones Schur orthogonality applies to. -/
