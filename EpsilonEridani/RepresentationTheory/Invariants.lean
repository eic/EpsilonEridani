# Invariants of group representations

Mathlib names the group sum `∑ g, ρ g` of a finite-group representation `Representation.norm`,
builds the averaging projection `Representation.averageMap` separately out of the group-algebra
element `GroupAlgebra.average`, and records that the latter projects onto the invariants
(`Representation.isProj_averageMap`). What it does not record is how the two operators relate.
The group sum is the shape a symmetrization operator actually takes at a use site, where the
normalizing factor `⅟(#G)` is usually left implicit, and reinstating it by hand is the step that
gets rewritten.

This file supplies the bridge. Unfolding the group algebra once identifies `averageMap` with
`norm` scaled by `⅟(#G)`, and since scaling by a unit changes no image, `norm` has the same range
as the projection: the invariants.

The file also records the companion description of the invariants available when `G` is cyclic.
Invariance is a condition on every group element, but a vector fixed by a generator is fixed by all
of its powers, so testing a single generator `g` suffices and the invariants are cut out by the one
linear map `ρ(g) - 1`. Mathlib states this elementwise, in
`Representation.mem_invariants_iff_of_forall_mem_zpowers`; the submodule-level equality with
`ker (ρ(g) - 1)` is the form used to present the (co)homology of a finite cyclic group as a
subquotient of `M`, where each group is the homology of `ρ(g) - 1` and the norm in one order or
the other.

Finally, a nontrivial irreducible representation has no nonzero invariant vector. This is what makes
the Haar integral of a nontrivial irreducible character vanish. A dimension-based corollary handles
the common case where nontriviality follows from the dimension being other than one.

Taking invariants under a normal subgroup `S`, Mathlib's `Rep.quotientToInvariantsFunctor`, is an
additive functor from representations of `G` to representations of `G ⧸ S`.

## Main results

* `Representation.averageMap_eq_invOf_card_smul_norm`: the averaging projection is the group sum
  `Representation.norm` scaled by the inverse of the group order.
* `Representation.range_norm_eq_invariants`: the group sum `Representation.norm ρ` has the
  invariants as its range.
* `Rep.FiniteCyclicGroup.invariants_eq_ker_apply_sub`: for a cyclic group, the invariants are the
  kernel of the action of a generator minus the identity.
* `Representation.IsIrreducible.invariants_eq_bot`: a nontrivial irreducible representation has no
  nonzero invariant vector.
* `Representation.IsIrreducible.invariants_eq_bot_of_finrank_ne_one`: the dimension-based
  specialization.
* `Rep.quotientToInvariantsFunctor` is additive.
