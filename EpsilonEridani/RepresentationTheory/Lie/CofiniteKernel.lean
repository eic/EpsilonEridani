# Cofinite kernels of finite-dimensional Lie representations

A Lie algebra map `f : L →ₗ⁅K⁆ A` into an associative algebra extends along the universal property
to an algebra homomorphism `UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.lift K f`.  The motivating case is a
representation `ρ : L →ₗ⁅K⁆ Module.End K V`, but nothing below uses the endomorphism structure, so
the results are stated for an arbitrary associative target.  When `A` is finite-dimensional, the
kernel of this extension is cofinite: its quotient embeds linearly in `A`.  As a ring-homomorphism
kernel it is automatically a two-sided ideal in Mathlib's ideal API.

The same kernel records nilpotence of the original map.  For `x : L`, the element `f x` is
nilpotent exactly when some power of the canonical generator `ι x` belongs to the kernel.  This is
the form needed when a finite-dimensional representation is replaced by a smaller ideal while
preserving nilpotence of selected operators.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.finiteDimensional_quotient_ker_lift`: its quotient is
  finite-dimensional.
* `EpsilonEridani.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.isNilpotent_iff_exists_pow_ι_mem_ker_lift`: nilpotence of
  the image of an element is equivalent to membership of a power of its enveloping generator in
  the kernel.
