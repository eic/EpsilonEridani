# The diagonal torus in the standard representation

The **diagonal torus** `EpsilonEridani.diagonalTorus k n` of `GL n k`, the subgroup of invertible
diagonal matrices, is built in
`EpsilonEridani.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.Diagonal.Basic`, where its three descriptions —
as the range of `EpsilonEridani.diagGL`, by diagonality of the matrix, and as its own centralizer — are
proved.
What is recorded here is its action on the coordinate lines `k ∙ eᵢ` of the standard
representation: every torus element scales `eᵢ` by its `i`-th diagonal entry
(`EpsilonEridani.stdRep_apply_basisFun_of_mem_diagonalTorus`), so each line is stable
(`EpsilonEridani.map_stdRep_span_basisFun`).

Over a general `k` these lines are not yet the *weight spaces* of the torus: that identification
needs the coordinate characters to be pairwise distinct, and it fails outright when the torus is
trivial, as it is over `𝔽₂` (`EpsilonEridani.diagonalTorus_eq_bot`).

## Main statements

* `EpsilonEridani.map_stdRep_span_basisFun`: the coordinate lines of the standard representation are
  stable under the diagonal torus.
