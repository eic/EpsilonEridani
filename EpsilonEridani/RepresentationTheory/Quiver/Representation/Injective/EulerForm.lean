# The Euler form against the dimension vector of a vertex injective

The Euler form of a finite quiver is the numerical shadow of the homological pairing: for
finite-dimensional representations of an acyclic quiver, `⟨dim M, dim N⟩` is
`dim Hom(M, N) - dim Ext¹(M, N)`. On the injective `Iᵢ` in the *right-hand* argument that identity
needs no `Ext`, because `Ext¹(-, Iᵢ)` vanishes and `Hom(M, Iᵢ)` is the dual of `Mᵢ`. This file
proves the resulting closed formula,

`⟨d, dim Iᵢ⟩ = dᵢ` for every `d : Q → ℤ`,

which holds over any finite quiver with finitely many paths into `i` — no acyclicity, no
algebraically closed field, no finite-dimensionality of the representations involved.

It is the mirror image of `EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Representation.Projective.EulerForm`,
which computes the Euler form against `dim Pᵢ` in the *left-hand* argument. The Euler form is not
symmetric, so neither file's results follow from the other's; what makes them mirror images is that
the path-count vector of `Iᵢ` is the transpose of that of `Pᵢ`
(`EpsilonEridani.dimVector_indecInjRep_eq_dimVector_indecProjRep`).

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.eulerForm_dimVector_indecInjRep`: `⟨d, dim Iᵢ⟩ = dᵢ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.eulerForm_dimVector_indecInjRep_eq_finrank_hom`: the homological reading,
  `⟨dim M, dim Iᵢ⟩ = dim Hom(M, Iᵢ)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.eulerForm_dimVector_indecInjRep_indecInjRep`: the Cartan pairing of two injectives
  counts the paths `j → i`, the same count as for two projectives.
* `EpsilonEridani.eulerForm_dimVector_indecProjRep_indecInjRep`: the mixed pairing `⟨dim Pᵢ, dim Iⱼ⟩`
  counts the paths `i → j`.

## Implementation notes

The combinatorial core is `EpsilonEridani.eulerForm_card_path_right`, in
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.EulerForm`, which pairs the Euler form against a path-count
vector on the right; the results below just rewrite `dim Iᵢ` into that path count.

The hypothesis carried throughout is `∀ a, Finite (Quiver.Path a i)`, for the vertex `i` at hand:
the finiteness that makes `EpsilonEridani.dimVector (indecInjRep k Q i)` an honest path count rather than
the `0` that `Module.finrank` returns on an infinite-dimensional space. For a finite quiver it
follows from acyclicity, by `EpsilonEridani.finite_paths_of_isAcyclic`; the loop quiver, where it fails, is
exactly the boundary case the roadmap records. It is the transpose of the hypothesis
`∀ a, Finite (Quiver.Path i a)` carried by the projective file, and neither implies the other.

Dimension vectors take values in `ℕ` while the Euler form is defined on `Q → ℤ`, so every statement
below feeds the Euler form the pointwise cast `fun v ↦ (dimVector M v : ℤ)`.
