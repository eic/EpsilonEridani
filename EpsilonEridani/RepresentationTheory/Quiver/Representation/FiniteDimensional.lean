# Finite-dimensional quiver representations

A representation of a quiver is **pointwise finite-dimensional** when the vector space it puts at
every vertex is finite-dimensional. This file defines that property, `EpsilonEridani.IsFinDim`, and proves
that it transports along an isomorphism of representations.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsFinDim`: a representation is finite-dimensional at every vertex.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.IsFinDim.of_iso`: pointwise finite-dimensionality transports along an isomorphism.

## Implementation notes

`IsFinDim` is stated vertex by vertex rather than as a single finiteness of the total space: the
category of representations is a functor category, with no ambient module to be finite over, and
over an infinite vertex set the two conditions genuinely differ. Over a finite quiver they agree,
and that is the setting the theory is meant for.

## References

This implements the `IsFinDim` part of the "finite representation type" item of Layer 5 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/QuiverRepresentations/README.md`; the property itself is
finite-dimensionality of representations, and is used well before that layer's theory.
