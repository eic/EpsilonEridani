# Irreducible morphisms of quiver representations

`EpsilonEridani/CategoryTheory/IrreducibleMorphism.lean` defines an irreducible morphism in an arbitrary
category — one that is neither a split mono nor a split epi and factors only trivially. This file
draws the vertexwise consequences of that notion for representations of a quiver, where a
morphism is a natural transformation between functors into `ModuleCat k` and the conditions of
being a monomorphism, an epimorphism or an isomorphism are all detected vertex by vertex.
Irreducibility itself is not such a condition, and neither is splitness: a pointwise split
morphism need not admit a natural splitting.

The category `EpsilonEridani.QuiverRep k Q` of representations is abelian, being a functor category into
the abelian category of `k`-modules, so the general dichotomy applies: an irreducible morphism of
quiver representations is a monomorphism or an epimorphism, hence **injective at every vertex or
surjective at every vertex**. This is a necessary condition, not a characterization: it is the
concrete form taken by the morphisms an arrow of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of a quiver algebra
represents, but it does not by itself certify irreducibility.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.QuiverRep.injective_or_surjective_of_isIrreducibleMorphism`: an irreducible morphism of
  quiver representations is injective at every vertex, or surjective at every vertex.
* `EpsilonEridani.QuiverRep.not_forall_bijective_of_isIrreducibleMorphism`: it is never bijective at
  every vertex, a pointwise isomorphism of quiver representations being an isomorphism.
* `EpsilonEridani.QuiverRep.not_forall_surjective_of_isIrreducibleMorphism_of_forall_injective` and
  `EpsilonEridani.QuiverRep.not_forall_injective_of_isIrreducibleMorphism_of_forall_surjective`: the two
  alternatives of the first result exclude one another.

## Implementation notes

The two clauses of the first result are not exclusive as stated — being injective everywhere and
surjective everywhere would make the morphism an isomorphism, which
`not_forall_bijective_of_isIrreducibleMorphism` rules out, so together they say that exactly one
of the two alternatives holds. Both directions of that exclusion are stated, since a consumer
knows one alternative and wants to rule the other out.

Both proofs pass through Mathlib's pointwise criteria for monomorphisms and epimorphisms in a
functor category (`CategoryTheory.NatTrans.mono_iff_mono_app`,
`CategoryTheory.NatTrans.epi_iff_epi_app`), which need pullbacks resp. pushouts in the target
category; `ModuleCat k` has both. Vertices are quantified as objects of `CategoryTheory.Paths Q`
rather than of `Q`, because that is the index a natural transformation between representations is
applied at; the two agree along `CategoryTheory.Paths.of`.

morphism is a monomorphism or an epimorphism; in a functor category into `ModuleCat k` those are
detected vertex by vertex, and there they are injectivity and surjectivity. -/
