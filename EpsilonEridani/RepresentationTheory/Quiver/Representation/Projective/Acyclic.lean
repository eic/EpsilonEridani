# The projectives at a vertex of an acyclic quiver

Over an acyclic quiver the only path `i → i` is the trivial one, so the path counts that
`EpsilonEridani.finrank_hom_indecProjRep_indecProjRep` and `EpsilonEridani.titsForm_dimVector_indecProjRep`
compute collapse to `1` on the endomorphisms of `Pᵢ` and on the Tits norm of its dimension vector:
the projective `Pᵢ` is a brick, and `dim Pᵢ` is a root.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.finrank_end_indecProjRep_of_isAcyclic`: `dim End(Pᵢ) = 1` over an acyclic quiver.
* `EpsilonEridani.titsForm_dimVector_indecProjRep_of_isAcyclic`: `titsForm (dim Pᵢ) = 1` over an acyclic
  quiver, acyclicity supplying the finiteness of the paths out of `i` as well.

/-- **Over an acyclic quiver the dimension vector of `Pᵢ` is a root of the Tits form**: its Tits
norm is `1`, the trivial path being the only closed path at `i`. Acyclicity also supplies the
finiteness of the paths out of `i`, by `EpsilonEridani.finite_paths_of_isAcyclic`, so no path-finiteness
hypothesis is needed. -/
