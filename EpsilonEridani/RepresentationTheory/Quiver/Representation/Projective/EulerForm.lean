# The Euler form against the dimension vector of a vertex projective

The Euler form of a finite quiver is the numerical shadow of the homological pairing: for
finite-dimensional representations of an acyclic quiver, `⟨dim M, dim N⟩` is
`dim Hom(M, N) - dim Ext¹(M, N)`. On the projective `Pᵢ` that identity needs no `Ext`, because
`Ext¹(Pᵢ, -)` vanishes and `Hom(Pᵢ, N)` is `Nᵢ`. This file proves the resulting closed formula,

`⟨dim Pᵢ, e⟩ = eᵢ` for every `e : Q → ℤ`,

which holds over any finite quiver with finitely many paths — no acyclicity, no algebraically
closed field, no finite-dimensionality of the representations involved.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.eulerForm_dimVector_indecProjRep`: `⟨dim Pᵢ, e⟩ = eᵢ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.eulerForm_dimVector_indecProjRep_eq_finrank_hom`: the homological reading,
  `⟨dim Pᵢ, dim N⟩ = dim Hom(Pᵢ, N)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.eulerForm_dimVector_indecProjRep_indecProjRep`: the Cartan pairing of two projectives
  counts the paths `j → i`.

## Implementation notes

The combinatorial core is `EpsilonEridani.eulerForm_card_path_left`, in
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.EulerForm`, which pairs a path-count vector against the Euler
form; the results below just rewrite `dim Pᵢ` into that path count. Over an acyclic quiver the Tits
norm of `dim Pᵢ` is `1`; that statement lives in
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Representation.Projective.Acyclic`.

The hypothesis carried throughout is `∀ a, Finite (Quiver.Path i a)`, for the vertex `i` at hand:
the finiteness that makes `EpsilonEridani.dimVector (indecProjRep k Q i)` an honest path count rather than
the `0` that `Module.finrank` returns on an infinite-dimensional space. For a finite quiver it
follows from acyclicity, by `EpsilonEridani.finite_paths_of_isAcyclic`; the loop quiver, where it fails, is
exactly the boundary case the roadmap records.

Dimension vectors take values in `ℕ` while the Euler form is defined on `Q → ℤ`, so every statement
below feeds the Euler form the pointwise cast `fun v ↦ (dimVector M v : ℤ)`.

The dual statements, for the injective `Iᵢ` on the right-hand side of the Euler form, need the
decomposition of a path by its *first* arrow, which
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.LastArrow` does not provide; that decomposition is built in
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.FirstArrow` and the dual statements are in
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Representation.Injective.EulerForm`.
