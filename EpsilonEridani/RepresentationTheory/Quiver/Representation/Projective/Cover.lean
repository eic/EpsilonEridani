# The vertex projective is the projective cover of the vertex simple

For a vertex `i` of a quiver `Q` the surjection `Pᵢ ↠ Sᵢ` of
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Representation.Comparison` exhibits the vertex simple as a
quotient of the vertex projective. This file proves that as soon as the trivial path is the only
path `i → i`, that surjection is a *projective cover*: it is an essential epimorphism, so nothing
smaller than `Pᵢ` maps onto `Sᵢ`.

Some such hypothesis is genuinely needed. For the quiver with one vertex and one loop the path
algebra is `k[X]`, the kernel of `Pᵢ ↠ Sᵢ` is the ideal `(X)`, and `(X) + (X - 1) = k[X]` with
`(X - 1)` proper, so that kernel is not superfluous and `Pᵢ ↠ Sᵢ` is not a cover. The hypothesis
used below is the *local* one, `∀ p : Quiver.Path i i, p = Quiver.Path.nil`: what it buys is that
the vertex space `(Pᵢ)ᵢ` is the *line* through the basis vector of the trivial path
(`EpsilonEridani.exists_eq_smul_indecProjRepBasis_nil`), and a morphism `g : X ⟶ Pᵢ` whose composite with
`Pᵢ ↠ Sᵢ` is onto must then hit that basis vector exactly, not merely up to the kernel. Cycles
elsewhere in `Q` are irrelevant to the cover at `i`, so acyclicity of the whole quiver is a
sufficient uniform hypothesis rather than a necessary one: a proof carrying
`hQ : EpsilonEridani.Quiver.IsAcyclic Q` instantiates every result below by passing `hQ.eq_nil`.

Hitting it is already enough, with no hypothesis on `Q` at all: `Pᵢ` is *generated* by the basis
vector of the trivial path, so a morphism into `Pᵢ` whose image contains it is a **split**
epimorphism. That half of the argument is quiver-independent structure theory of `Pᵢ` and lives
upstream, beside the universal property it is a corollary of, in
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Representation.Projective.Basic`
(`EpsilonEridani.isSplitEpi_of_app_eq_indecProjRepBasis_nil`, together with the line lemma and
`EpsilonEridani.eq_id_of_app_indecProjRepBasis_nil_eq_self`). The essential-epimorphism statement below
is the composite of that generation lemma with the line lemma.

Two consequences package the cover: the comparison morphism admits no endomorphism of `Pᵢ` over
`Sᵢ` other than the identity (rigidity), and every projective representation mapping onto `Sᵢ`
has `Pᵢ` as a direct summand (minimality). They stand in different relations to the general
theory. Rigidity *sharpens* it: `EpsilonEridani.IsEssentialEpi.isIso_of_comp_eq` concludes only that such
an endomorphism is an isomorphism, while here it is the identity. Minimality is an instantiation
rather than a sharpening — the general split-factorization statement
`EpsilonEridani.IsEssentialEpi.exists_comp_eq_and_isSplitEpi` read at `Pᵢ ↠ Sᵢ`. Uniqueness — that any
two projective covers of `Sᵢ` are isomorphic over `Sᵢ`, so `Pᵢ` is *the* projective cover of
`Sᵢ` — is the general categorical statement
`EpsilonEridani.IsEssentialEpi.exists_iso`, instantiated here at `Pᵢ ↠ Sᵢ`.

The cover is stated in the category of representations, not through the module-level
`EpsilonEridani.IsProjectiveCover`. It is the categorical reading of the *same* condition: over an
additive group `EpsilonEridani.isProjectiveCover_iff_forall_surjective` says that the projective covers
of a module are exactly the essential epimorphisms onto it from a projective module, and that is
what is proved here for `Pᵢ ↠ Sᵢ`. Transporting the statement across
`EpsilonEridani.quiverRepEquivalence` to a literal `EpsilonEridani.IsProjectiveCover` of `kQ`-modules would need
two further bridges — the identification of the image of `Pᵢ` with the left ideal `kQ · eᵢ`, and
the comparison of an essential epimorphism of `ModuleCat` with a superfluous kernel — and neither
is built here.

Every statement here compares `Pᵢ` with `Sᵢ`, so every statement here takes the field in the
universe `max v w` of the vertices and the arrows: that is the restriction under which the two
objects lie in a common category at all, and the implementation notes of
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Representation.Comparison` document it. The generation
lemmas mention only `Pᵢ` and carry no such restriction, which is a second reason they live
upstream in `EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Representation.Projective.Basic` rather than
here.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.eq_indecProjRepBasis_nil_of_app_eq_simpleRepGenerator` and
  `EpsilonEridani.exists_app_eq_indecProjRepBasis_nil`: with no nontrivial path `i → i`, `Pᵢ ↠ Sᵢ`
  separates that basis vector from the rest of `(Pᵢ)ᵢ`, so a morphism into `Pᵢ` that is onto `Sᵢ`
  after composing with it hits the basis vector.
* `EpsilonEridani.isSplitEpi_of_epi_comp_indecProjRepToSimpleRep` and
  `EpsilonEridani.epi_of_epi_comp_indecProjRepToSimpleRep`: **`Pᵢ ↠ Sᵢ` is an essential epimorphism** —
  in the sharper form that every `g : X ⟶ Pᵢ` whose composite with it is an epimorphism is
  already a *split* epimorphism — so `Pᵢ` is the projective cover of `Sᵢ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.eq_id_of_comp_indecProjRepToSimpleRep_eq_self`: the cover is rigid — an endomorphism of
  `Pᵢ` commuting with it is the identity.
* `EpsilonEridani.isEssentialEpi_indecProjRepToSimpleRep`: the cover packaged as a
  `EpsilonEridani.IsEssentialEpi`, the form the general theory consumes.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_comp_indecProjRepToSimpleRep_eq_and_isSplitEpi`: the cover is minimal — every
  projective representation mapping onto `Sᵢ` retracts onto `Pᵢ`, by a retraction that factors the
  given map through the cover.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_iso_indecProjRep`: **the cover is unique** — every projective cover of `Sᵢ` is
  isomorphic to `Pᵢ` over `Sᵢ`.

composite already being onto `Sᵢ` forces `g` to have a section, so `Pᵢ` is a direct summand of
every source that covers `Sᵢ` through it. -/
