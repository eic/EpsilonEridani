# Finite representation type

A quiver has **finite representation type** when it has only finitely many isomorphism classes of
finite-dimensional indecomposable representations. This file defines `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteRepType`, the
finiteness of the skeleton of the full subcategory of finite-dimensional indecomposables, whose
objects are the representations that are pointwise finite-dimensional
(`EpsilonEridani.IsFinDim`, from `EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Representation.FiniteDimensional`)
and indecomposable; and it proves the criterion by which the property is refuted: an infinite
family of pairwise non-isomorphic finite-dimensional indecomposables.

Both directions of that criterion are proved, because both are used. The refuting direction is what
exhibits a quiver of infinite representation type; the affirming direction is what a quiver of
finite representation type is *for*, namely that any family of pairwise non-isomorphic
finite-dimensional indecomposables is finite, so that "the indecomposables" may be counted.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteRepType`: the quiver has finitely many finite-dimensional indecomposables up to
  isomorphism.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.not_isFiniteRepType_of_infinite`: an infinite family of pairwise non-isomorphic
  finite-dimensional indecomposables refutes finite representation type.
* `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteRepType.finite_of_pairwise_nonisomorphic`: conversely, under finite
  representation type every such family is indexed by a finite type.

## Implementation notes

The definition does not carry `[Finite Q]`. The roadmap pins `IsFiniteRepType` with that instance
binder, to record the intended setting, but nothing in the statement consumes it and an unused
instance argument is a linter error here; a consumer that needs a finite vertex set -- Gabriel's
dichotomy does -- states it where it is used. Dropping it costs nothing: the definition reads the
same, and it stays meaningful over an infinite quiver.

The skeleton is Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Skeleton`, so `IsFiniteRepType` is a finiteness statement
about an honest type of isomorphism classes rather than about a hand-rolled quotient. The bridge in
both proofs below is `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.toSkeleton_eq_toSkeleton_iff_nonempty_iso`,
that two objects of a full subcategory have the same class in its skeleton exactly when they are
isomorphic in the ambient category.

The two results are stated for a family `M : α → QuiverRep k Q` rather than for a set of
representations: a family is what the worked examples produce -- the loop quiver's family is
indexed by the base field -- and injectivity up to isomorphism is expressed directly on the index
type.

`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/QuiverRepresentations/README.md`, on which its Gabriel
dichotomy and the loop-quiver and Kronecker worked examples are stated.
