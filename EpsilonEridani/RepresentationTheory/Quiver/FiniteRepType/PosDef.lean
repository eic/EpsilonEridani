# A positive definite Tits form forces finite representation type

Let `V` be a finite quiver whose Tits form is positive definite, the numerical side of the ADE
condition in Gabriel's theorem. This file proves that `V` has finite representation type
(`EpsilonEridani.isFiniteRepType_of_titsForm_posDef`), and bounds the number of its indecomposables by the
number of positive roots of the Tits form
(`EpsilonEridani.card_skeleton_indecomposable_le_card_positiveRoots`).

Both come from one map. The dimension vector is constant on isomorphism classes, so it descends to
the skeleton of the finite-dimensional indecomposables as `EpsilonEridani.isoClassDimVector`. That map
lands in the positive roots, by `EpsilonEridani.titsForm_dimVector_eq_one_of_indecomposable_of_isAcyclic`,
and is injective, by `EpsilonEridani.nonempty_iso_of_dimVector_eq_of_indecomposable_of_isAcyclic`; a
positive definite integral quadratic form takes the value `1` only finitely often, by
`QuadraticMap.PosDef.finite_setOf_apply_eq`, so the skeleton is finite.

No acyclicity hypothesis appears, although both consumed theorems ask for one: a directed cycle
would already contradict positive definiteness, by
`EpsilonEridani.isAcyclic_of_titsForm_posDef`.

This is the affirming half of Gabriel's dichotomy, and the half that the earlier work leaves to be
read off: the two theorems it consumes were proved for their own sake, one saying that a dimension
vector of an indecomposable is a root and one that it determines the indecomposable, and neither
draws the finiteness conclusion. The refuting half, that a quiver outside Dynkin type has infinitely
many indecomposables, is `EpsilonEridani.not_isFiniteRepType_of_infinite` applied to an explicit family, as
in `EpsilonEridani.not_isFiniteRepType_kronecker`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.isoClassDimVector`: the dimension vector of an isomorphism class of finite-dimensional
  indecomposable representations, as an integer vector.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.titsForm_isoClassDimVector_eq_one` and `EpsilonEridani.isoClassDimVector_nonneg`: the dimension
  vector of a class of indecomposables is a positive root of the Tits form.
* `EpsilonEridani.isoClassDimVector_injective`: **the Gabriel injection.** Distinct classes of
  indecomposables have distinct dimension vectors, so `EpsilonEridani.isoClassDimVectorEmbedding` embeds
  the isomorphism classes into the positive roots.
* `EpsilonEridani.isFiniteRepType_of_titsForm_posDef`: **a finite quiver with positive definite Tits form
  has finite representation type.**
* `EpsilonEridani.card_skeleton_indecomposable_le_card_positiveRoots`: it has at most as many
  indecomposables as the Tits form has positive roots.

## Implementation notes

The isomorphism classes are Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Skeleton` of the full subcategory of
finite-dimensional indecomposable representations, spelled out rather than abbreviated, exactly as
in `EpsilonEridani.IsFiniteRepType` and in `EpsilonEridani.card_skeleton_indecomposable_kronecker`.

`EpsilonEridani.isoClassDimVector` reads its representation off through `CategoryTheory.fromSkeleton`
rather than by a quotient lift. The skeleton is a quotient by definition, but that definition is not
part of its interface; `CategoryTheory.toSkeleton_fromSkeleton_obj` returns the chosen
representative to its own class, which is all a map out of the skeleton needs.

The vertex spaces live in `max v w x` because that is the universe in which the reflection functors
of `EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Reflection.Basic` produce them: the reflected vertex space
at a sink is cut out of a product indexed by the arrows there.

This is the affirming direction of Gabriel's dichotomy: the dimension vector embeds the
isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional indecomposables into the roots of the Tits form, of which
a positive definite form has only finitely many.

The refuting direction is `EpsilonEridani.not_isFiniteRepType_of_infinite`, which asks instead for an
