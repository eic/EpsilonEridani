# Dimension vectors of isomorphism classes of indecomposables

The dimension vector is constant on isomorphism classes, so it descends to the skeleton of the
finite-dimensional indecomposable representations as `EpsilonEridani.isoClassDimVector`. This file gives
the generic map and its computation rules; results requiring a positive definite Tits form live in
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.FiniteRepType.PosDef`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.isoClassDimVector`: the dimension vector of an isomorphism class of finite-dimensional
  indecomposable representations, as an integer vector.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isoClassDimVector_toSkeleton`: the map sends the class of a representation to that
  representation's dimension vector.
* `EpsilonEridani.isoClassDimVector_nonneg`: the resulting integer vector is nonnegative.

## Implementation notes

`EpsilonEridani.isoClassDimVector` reads its representation through `CategoryTheory.fromSkeleton` rather
than by a quotient lift. The skeleton is a quotient by definition, but that definition is not part
of its interface; `CategoryTheory.toSkeleton_fromSkeleton_obj` returns the chosen representative to
its own class, which is all a map out of the skeleton needs.

The vertex spaces remain in `max v w x`, matching the universe in which the reflection functors
produce them and preserving the common API used by the finite-representation-type results.

This supports the dimension-vector map in the Gabriel correspondence of Layer 5 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/QuiverRepresentations/README.md`.
