# Symmetrified quivers

This file supplies general infrastructure for Mathlib's `Quiver.Symmetrify` construction.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.symmetrify_of_obj`: the doubling inclusion is the identity on vertices.

## References

This file supplies a prerequisite for Layer 4 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ZigzagPreprojective/README.md`.

/-- The inclusion `Quiver.Symmetrify.of` of a quiver in its doubled quiver is the identity on
vertices.  Deliberately not a `simp` lemma: the two vertex types are definitionally equal, so
rewriting `Quiver.Symmetrify.of` away erases the only record of which of the two quiver structures
a vertex was meant to carry. -/
