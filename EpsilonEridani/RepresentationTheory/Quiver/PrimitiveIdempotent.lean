# The vertex idempotents of a path algebra are primitive

When the trivial path is the only path from `v` to `v`, the corner ring `eᵥ kQ eᵥ` of the vertex
idempotent at `v` is as small as it can be: `eᵥ f eᵥ` is a scalar multiple of `eᵥ`
(`EpsilonEridani.vertexIdempotent_mul_mul_vertexIdempotent`), so the corner ring is a copy of `k`. As soon
as `0` and `1` are the only idempotents of `k` — that is, as soon as `1` is a primitive idempotent
of `k`, which holds over a domain and over a local ring (`EpsilonEridani.isPrimitiveIdempotent_one`) — the
only idempotents of that corner are therefore `0` and `eᵥ`, which is exactly primitivity of `eᵥ`.

The path hypothesis is local to `v`, cycles elsewhere in the quiver being irrelevant; an acyclic
quiver supplies it at every vertex through `EpsilonEridani.Quiver.IsAcyclic.eq_nil`.

Read through `EpsilonEridani.isPrimitiveIdempotent_iff_isIndecomposableModule`, this says that the left
ideal `kQ eᵥ` — the indecomposable projective `Pᵥ` — is an indecomposable module. That the
corresponding *representation* `EpsilonEridani.indecProjRep` is indecomposable is already known
categorically (`EpsilonEridani.Quiver.Representation.indecomposable_indecProjRep`); the statement here is
the module-level one, about the left ideal of `kQ` itself, and it is the input to the
primitive-idempotent decomposition of `1 = ∑ᵥ eᵥ`.

The path hypothesis is what the proof needs, not what the statement needs. With an oriented cycle
through `v` the corner ring is the monoid algebra of the monoid of paths `v → v`, which is free on
the loops at `v` that do not return to `v` in between; a free associative algebra over a domain is
a domain, so `0` and `eᵥ` remain its only idempotents and `eᵥ` remains primitive — for the one-loop
quiver, where `kQ ≅ k[X]` and the single vertex idempotent is `1`, this is just that `k[X]` is a
domain. What the hypothesis buys is the scalar corner computation run here, which is unavailable in
that generality.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isPrimitiveIdempotent_vertexIdempotent`: **a vertex idempotent of the path algebra of a
  finite quiver is primitive** as soon as the trivial path is the only path at its vertex and `1`
  is primitive in the coefficient ring.
* `EpsilonEridani.isIndecomposableModule_span_singleton_vertexIdempotent`: consequently the left ideal
  `kQ eᵥ` is an indecomposable `kQ`-module.

Primitivity of `eᵥ` is a semiring-level statement, and is proved here directly from the definition,
transporting a decomposition of `eᵥ` to one of `1` in the coefficient ring. Additive inverses enter
only with the corollary, the module characterization asking for a ring.

## References

This supplies the vertex-idempotent instance of the primitive idempotents of Layer 3A in
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/QuiverRepresentations/README.md`, whose Layer 1 identifies
`kQ eᵥ` with the indecomposable projective `Pᵥ`.

/-- **A vertex idempotent with no nontrivial path at its vertex is primitive.** Both summands of a
decomposition of `eᵥ` lie in the corner ring `eᵥ kQ eᵥ`, hence are the trivial path at `v` carrying
a scalar coefficient; reading off those coefficients turns the decomposition into a decomposition
of `1` in the coefficient ring, where `1` is primitive. -/
