# The loop quiver

The loop quiver `•↺` has a single vertex and a single arrow from it to itself. It is the smallest
quiver that is not acyclic, which makes it the standard boundary case of the theory: its path
algebra is the infinite-dimensional `k[X]`
(`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.OneLoop.PathAlgebra`), and it has infinite representation
type over every field (`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.OneLoop.FiniteRepType`).

This file carries only the vertex and arrow data, so that both of those developments can rest on
it without one depending on the other.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Quiver.OneLoop`: the vertex type, a singleton, with a `Quiver` instance whose only
  arrow type is `PUnit`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Quiver.OneLoop.loop`: the unique arrow, from the vertex to itself.

## References

This file supplies the vertex and arrow data of the loop-quiver worked example of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/QuiverRepresentations/README.md`, alongside the generalized
Kronecker quiver of `EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Kronecker.Basic` and the `D₄` quiver of
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.D4.Basic`.
