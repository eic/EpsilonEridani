# A module over a path algebra is a representation of the quiver

A left module `M` over the path algebra `kQ` of a finite quiver carries one `k`-subspace for each
vertex, `Mᵥ = eᵥ M`, and one `k`-linear map for each path, the action of that path. This file
builds that data and proves the three facts that make it a representation of `Q`:

* the vertex subspaces are an internal direct sum, `M = ⨁ᵥ eᵥ M`
  (`EpsilonEridani.isInternal_vertexComponent`);
* a path from `a` to `b` carries `Mₐ` into `M_b` and annihilates every other vertex subspace
  (`EpsilonEridani.ofPath_smul_mem_vertexComponent`,
  `EpsilonEridani.ofPath_smul_eq_zero_of_ne_of_mem_vertexComponent`);
* the resulting maps are functorial in the path (`EpsilonEridani.pathMap_nil`,
  `EpsilonEridani.pathMap_comp`) and in the module (`EpsilonEridani.vertexComponentMap_id`,
  `EpsilonEridani.vertexComponentMap_comp`), the two being compatible
  (`EpsilonEridani.vertexComponentMap_comp_pathMap`).

This is the direction "module ↦ representation" of the equivalence between representations of `Q`
and left `kQ`-modules; the vertex idempotents are what makes it work, and the finiteness of the
vertex set is load-bearing, being what makes `∑ᵥ eᵥ = 1` a finite sum and `kQ` unital.

The orientation is fixed by the *later factor first* product of `EpsilonEridani.pathAlgebra`: with it,
`e_b · p = p` and `p · eₐ = p` for a path `p` from `a` to `b`, so left multiplication by `p` sends
the component at the **source** to the component at the **target**, and the representations
obtained here are the covariant ones. Reversing the product would transpose every statement below.

## Implementation notes

Only the underlying data and its functoriality are built here: no object of
`EpsilonEridani.QuiverRep k Q` (`Paths Q ⥤ ModuleCat k`, in
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Representation.Basic`) and no functor into it is assembled,
and `EpsilonEridani.dimVector` is not used. Two things are missing for that. First, `QuiverRep` is stated
over a `Field k` while everything below needs only a `CommSemiring k`, so assembling the functor
here would either restrict the results or duplicate them. Second, the assembly is the roadmap
target `quiverRepEquivalence` itself, of which this file is the object-and-morphism half.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.vertexComponent k M v`: the `k`-subspace `eᵥ M` of a `kQ`-module `M`.
* `EpsilonEridani.pathMap k M p`: the `k`-linear map `Mₐ → M_b` given by the action of a path
  `p` from `a` to `b`.
* `EpsilonEridani.vertexComponentMap k f v`: the restriction of a `kQ`-linear map to the components at
  `v`.
* `EpsilonEridani.vertexProjection k M v`: the projection `x ↦ eᵥ • x` of `M` onto its component at `v`,
  the decomposition `M = ⨁ᵥ eᵥ M` read one vertex at a time.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.sum_coe_vertexProjection`: the vertex projections of `x` sum back to `x`, the vertex
  idempotents summing to `1`.
* `EpsilonEridani.isInternal_vertexComponent`: `M = ⨁ᵥ eᵥ M`, with
  `EpsilonEridani.coe_ofBijective_coeLinearMap_symm_apply_vertexComponent` reading off the component of
  `x` at `v` as `eᵥ • x`.
* `EpsilonEridani.finrank_eq_sum_finrank_vertexComponent`: for a `kQ`-module finite-dimensional over a
  field `k`, the dimension of `M` is the sum of the dimensions of the vertex subspaces — the total
  dimension read off the dimension vector.
* `EpsilonEridani.pathMap_nil` and `EpsilonEridani.pathMap_comp`: the path maps are functorial, the trivial path
  acting as the identity and a concatenation as the composite.
* `EpsilonEridani.vertexComponentMap_comp_pathMap`: the path maps are natural in the module.

`quiverRepEquivalence` "sends a module `M` to the representation `v ↦ eᵥ M`, with an arrow acting
by left multiplication, and inverts through the idempotent decomposition `M = ⨁ᵥ eᵥ M` (available
because `∑ᵥ eᵥ = 1`, hence the finiteness of the vertex set is load-bearing here)".
