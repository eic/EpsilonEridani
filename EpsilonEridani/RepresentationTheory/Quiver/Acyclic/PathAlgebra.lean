# The path algebra of an acyclic quiver

A finite quiver with finitely many arrows between any two vertices has finitely many paths when it
is acyclic, and the paths are a basis of its path algebra; so the path algebra of such a quiver is
finite-dimensional over a division ring.

Acyclicity is not merely sufficient but **necessary**: an oriented cycle contributes its infinitely
many powers to the path basis, so a path algebra that is a finite module over a nonzero base ring
has no oriented cycle, whatever the quiver. For a finite quiver with finite arrow types the two
conditions therefore agree, and finite-dimensionality of `kQ` *is* acyclicity of `Q`. The loop
quiver is the boundary case, where the path algebra is the additive monoid algebra of `ℕ` — the
polynomial ring, over a commutative base — and
`EpsilonEridani.not_finiteDimensional_pathAlgebra_oneLoop` records the failure directly.

This is the only place the generic path algebra of
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.PathAlgebra.Basic` meets acyclicity, which is why it is a
module of its own: the path algebra itself needs nothing from the theory of acyclic quivers.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.finiteDimensional_pathAlgebra_of_isAcyclic`: the path algebra of a finite acyclic
  quiver with finite arrow types is finite-dimensional.
* `EpsilonEridani.isAcyclic_of_module_finite_pathAlgebra`: **a path algebra that is a finite module over
  a nonzero base ring comes from an acyclic quiver**, with no finiteness assumed of the quiver.
* `EpsilonEridani.module_finite_pathAlgebra_iff_isAcyclic`: the two together, for a finite quiver with
  finite arrow types over a nonzero base semiring, and
  `EpsilonEridani.finiteDimensional_pathAlgebra_iff_isAcyclic` its reading over a division ring.

a basis, so finitely many of them are available; an oriented cycle would already contribute its
infinitely many powers.  Neither the vertices nor the arrows are assumed finite: it is the path
