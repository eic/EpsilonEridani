# Finite paths in acyclic quivers

This file proves that a finite quiver with finitely many arrows between any two vertices has only
finitely many paths **exactly when** it is acyclic. The forward half supplies the finiteness
hypothesis needed for the finite-dimensionality of its path algebra. The bound that makes the
count finite is the acyclic one: every path has length below the number of vertices, so the count
reduces to the bounded-length count of `EpsilonEridani.Combinatorics.Quiver.BoundedPaths`.

The converse needs no finiteness of the quiver at all: an oriented cycle has infinitely many
powers (`Quiver.Path.infinite_of_ne_nil`), so a quiver with finitely many paths has none — the
form the proof uses is the contrapositive `Quiver.Path.eq_nil_of_finite`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.finite_paths_of_isAcyclic`: a finite acyclic quiver with finite arrow types has
  finitely many paths.
* `EpsilonEridani.isAcyclic_of_finite_paths`: **a quiver with finitely many paths is acyclic.**
* `EpsilonEridani.isAcyclic_iff_finite_paths`: the two together, the extensional form of acyclicity that
  the finite-dimensionality of the path algebra is read off.
