# A positive definite Tits form forces acyclicity

A directed cycle is an obstruction to positive definiteness of the Tits form. Let `p` be a closed
path of positive length and let `d` be the indicator vector of the set `S` of vertices it visits.
Every vertex of `p` is the source of an arrow of `p`, and that arrow lands in `S` again, so the
arrow term of `EpsilonEridani.eulerForm` at `d` already absorbs the whole diagonal term: `titsForm d ≤ 0`
while `d ≠ 0`. Hence a finite quiver whose Tits form is positive definite is acyclic
(`EpsilonEridani.isAcyclic_of_titsForm_posDef`).

The counting is with distinct arrows, not with the arrows of `p` listed in order: a closed path may
traverse the same arrow twice, and the Euler form counts each arrow of the quiver once. The
injection that survives that is `v ↦ (an arrow of p out of v)`, whose injectivity is only that
distinct vertices are distinct sources; it appears below as the bound "each row of the arrow sum,
indexed by a vertex of `S`, is at least one".

The length-one case is the looplessness `EpsilonEridani.isEmpty_hom_self_of_titsForm_posDef` that the
reflection identities need, proved there directly from the arrow count at a single vertex.

The generic path facts used in the counting argument are
`EpsilonEridani.exists_hom_mem_path_vertices_of_mem_dropLast` and
`EpsilonEridani.exists_hom_mem_path_vertices`, from
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.FirstArrow`.

## Main result

* `EpsilonEridani.isAcyclic_of_titsForm_posDef`: **a finite quiver whose Tits form is positive definite is
  acyclic.**

## References

The positive definiteness of the Tits form is the numerical side of the ADE condition in Gabriel's
theorem, Layer 5 of `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/QuiverRepresentations/README.md`; this
file supplies the acyclicity that the reflection-functor induction there assumes separately. See

/-- **A finite quiver whose Tits form is positive definite is acyclic.** The indicator vector of the
vertices visited by a closed path of positive length has Tits value at most zero: each of its
vertices contributes `1` to the diagonal sum and, being the source of an arrow of the path, at least
`1` to the arrow sum as well. -/
