# The last arrow of a path

A path `i → b` in a quiver is either trivial, which forces `i = b`, or a path `i → a` followed by a
last arrow `a ⟶ b`. This file records that dichotomy as an equivalence and reads off the resulting
recursion for the number of paths out of a fixed vertex.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.pathLastArrowEquiv`: the last-arrow decomposition
  `Path i b ≃ PLift (i = b) ⊕ Σ a, Path i a × (a ⟶ b)`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.card_path_eq_ite_add_sum_lastArrow`: the path count `#(i → b)` equals
  `∑ₐ #(i → a) · #(a ⟶ b)`, plus `1` when `i = b` for the trivial path.

## Implementation notes

The equivalence is the constructor dichotomy of `Quiver.Path`: `Quiver.Path.nil` is the left summand
and `Quiver.Path.cons` the right one, so both directions are definitional matches. The proposition
`i = b` is wrapped in `PLift` only to make the summand a type, so that `Nat.card` applies. The
`simp` lemmas `EpsilonEridani.pathLastArrowEquiv_nil`, `EpsilonEridani.pathLastArrowEquiv_cons`,
`EpsilonEridani.pathLastArrowEquiv_symm_inl` and `EpsilonEridani.pathLastArrowEquiv_symm_inr` record those matches
on both summands, so consumers compute with the equivalence without unfolding it. Their proofs are
written `(rfl)` rather than `rfl`: the parenthesised form keeps the proof opaque to the module
system, so the equivalence itself need not be `@[expose]`d.

The dual decomposition, by the *first* arrow of a path, is not available in this form: the
recursion of `Quiver.Path` is on the target vertex, so the first arrow is not visible to a match.
It is built instead by an explicit recursion over the path, in
`EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.FirstArrow`.

## References

The path count is the combinatorial input to the Euler-form identity for the projective
representation at a vertex, Layer 4 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/QuiverRepresentations/README.md`.

/-- **The last-arrow recursion for path counts.** The paths `i → b` are the trivial one, present
exactly when `i = b`, together with a path `i → a` and an arrow `a ⟶ b`. All three cardinalities
are honest counts only when the paths out of `i` are finite, which is what the hypothesis
`[∀ a, Finite (Quiver.Path i a)]` provides. The only arrows counted are those into `b`, so
`[∀ a, Finite (a ⟶ b)]` suffices for the arrow factors.

This is the mirror image of `EpsilonEridani.card_path_eq_ite_add_sum_firstArrow`. -/
