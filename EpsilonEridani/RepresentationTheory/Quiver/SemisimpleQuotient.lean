# The semisimple quotient of a path algebra

Killing the arrows of a quiver leaves its vertices. This file makes that precise at the level of
algebras: reading off the coordinates of an element of `pathAlgebra k Q` on the trivial paths is an
algebra homomorphism `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.trivialCoeff` onto the product algebra `Q → k`, and its
kernel is exactly the arrow ideal. So the arrow ideal is the kernel of a map onto a product of
copies of the base semiring, and

`pathAlgebra k Q ⧸ arrowIdeal k Q ≃ₐ[k] (Q → k)`.

Multiplicativity is the one point that needs an argument, and it is the length filtration again:
concatenation adds lengths, so a product of paths is trivial only when both factors are, and the
coordinate of `f * g` on the trivial path at `v` is the product of the coordinates of `f` and of
`g` there.

For a **finite acyclic** quiver over a field the arrow ideal is the Jacobson radical
(`EpsilonEridani.jacobson_pathAlgebra_eq_arrowIdeal`), so the displayed equivalence becomes

`pathAlgebra k Q ⧸ Ring.jacobson (pathAlgebra k Q) ≃ₐ[k] (Q → k)`,

which is the Wedderburn decomposition of the semisimple quotient: one block for each vertex, and
every block is the base field itself. In particular the semisimple quotient is commutative and
reduced -- the path algebra of a finite acyclic quiver is a **basic** algebra, with every matrix
block of size one -- and its dimension is the number of vertices.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.trivialCoeff`: the algebra homomorphism `pathAlgebra k Q →ₐ[k] (Q → k)`
  reading off the coordinates on the trivial paths.
* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.quotientArrowIdealAlgEquiv`: the induced equivalence
  `pathAlgebra k Q ⧸ arrowIdeal k Q ≃ₐ[k] (Q → k)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.quotientJacobsonAlgEquiv`: the same equivalence for a finite acyclic quiver
  over a field, stated for the Jacobson radical.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.trivialCoeff_surjective` and `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.ker_trivialCoeff`: the
  trivial-coefficient map is onto `Q → k` with kernel the arrow ideal.
* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.isSemisimpleRing_quotient_jacobson`,
  `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.isReduced_quotient_jacobson` and `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.isBasic`: the quotient
  by the radical is semisimple and reduced, that is, **the path algebra of a finite acyclic quiver
  is a basic algebra**.
* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.finrank_quotient_jacobson`: the semisimple quotient has dimension the number
  of vertices.

## Implementation notes

`trivialCoeff` is built by hand rather than through a universal property, the path algebra having
no `lift` yet. Its multiplicativity is proved by reducing to basis paths with
`EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.induction_linear` and then splitting on composability, which is where
`EpsilonEridani.Quiver.TotalPath.eq_nil_iff` -- an indexed path is the trivial path at `v` exactly when it
starts at `v` and has length zero -- does the work of avoiding dependent rewriting.

The construction needs no acyclicity and no field: it is stated for a commutative base semiring and
a quiver with finitely many vertices, which may well have infinitely many paths. Acyclicity enters
only to identify the arrow ideal with the Jacobson radical, which is imported.
