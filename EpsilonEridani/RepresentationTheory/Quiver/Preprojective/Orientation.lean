# Orientation independence of the additive preprojective algebra

The additive preprojective algebra `Π_k(Q)` is built from the *doubled* quiver of `Q`, so it ought
not to depend on which of the two directions of each edge was chosen as the arrow of `Q`. That
independence is not a formality: the defining relator

```text
ρ = ∑_a (a a* - a* a)
```

pairs each arrow with its formal reverse *with a sign*, and turning an arrow around exchanges the
two backtracks, hence negates the corresponding summand. This file proves the independence by
exhibiting the isomorphism which repairs that sign.

Fix a `Bool`-valued labelling `σ` of the arrows of `Q` and let `Reorient Q σ` be the quiver of
`EpsilonEridani.Reorient`, obtained by turning around exactly the arrows labelled `true`. The two doubled
quivers are identified by `EpsilonEridani.reorientSymmetrify`, hence the two doubled path algebras by
`EpsilonEridani.reorientDoubledEquiv`. Under that identification the relator of `Reorient Q σ` becomes the
*gauged* relator `ρ_ε = ∑_a ε_a (a a* - a* a)` of `Q`, with `ε_a = -1` exactly when `σ` turns `a`
around
(`EpsilonEridani.reorientDoubledEquiv_preprojectiveRelator`), and matching the relations one vertex at a
time (`EpsilonEridani.reorientDoubledEquiv_localPreprojectiveRelator`). Composing with the gauge
isomorphism of `EpsilonEridani.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Preprojective.Gauge`, which rescales the
sign-flipped arrows by `-1` and fixes their formal reverses, gives

```text
Π_k(Reorient Q σ) ≃ₐ[k] Π_k(Q).
```

Turning around a single arrow is the case of a labelling supported on one arrow; an arbitrary `σ`
performs an arbitrary composite of such flips in one step, so the isomorphism above compares `Q`
with the explicit quiver `Reorient Q σ`. Nothing is assumed about the
characteristic of `k`: in characteristic two the sign is invisible, and the same statement is
obtained from the same proof.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.reorientSign` and `EpsilonEridani.reorientSignUnit`: the labelling by `-1` on the arrows `σ`
  turns around and by `1` elsewhere, valued in `k` and in `kˣ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.reorientDoubledEquiv`: the isomorphism of doubled path algebras induced by the
  comparison of doubled quivers.
* `EpsilonEridani.reorientPreprojectiveAlgebraEquivGauged`: the reoriented preprojective algebra,
  presented by the signed relator of `Q`.
* `EpsilonEridani.reorientPreprojectiveAlgebraEquiv`: **orientation independence**.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.reorientDoubledEquiv_headBacktrackElem_flip` and
  `EpsilonEridani.reorientDoubledEquiv_tailBacktrackElem_flip`: turning an arrow around exchanges its two
  backtracks. This is the sign.
* `EpsilonEridani.reorientDoubledEquiv_preprojectiveRelator`: the relator of a reorientation is the signed
  relator of `Q`.
* `EpsilonEridani.reorientDoubledEquiv_localPreprojectiveRelator`: the same, vertex by vertex.
* `EpsilonEridani.reorientPreprojectiveAlgebraEquiv_preprojectiveMk`: the isomorphism, computed on an
  arbitrary quotient representative, as the doubled-quiver identification followed by the rescaling
  by `-1` of the turned-around arrows.
* `EpsilonEridani.reorientPreprojectiveAlgebraEquiv_preprojectiveMk_ofArrow_keep` and its three
  companions: the isomorphism, computed on each of the four kinds of generator. An arrow `σ` leaves
  alone and its formal reverse are fixed, a turned-around arrow is carried to a formal reverse, and
  the formal reverse of a turned-around arrow is carried to the negative of an arrow.

## Implementation notes

The counting step is `EpsilonEridani.reorientDoubledEquiv_preprojectiveRelator`. A turned-around arrow
`a : j ⟶ i` of `Q` is an arrow `i ⟶ j` of `Reorient Q σ`, so its contribution to the relator of the
reorientation sits in the `(i, j)` hom set while its contribution to the signed relator of `Q` sits
in the `(j, i)` one. The two agree only after the two vertex summations are exchanged, which is
what the transposition step of the proof does; the equality does *not* hold hom set by hom set.

## References

This is the orientation-independence clause of Layer 4 of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/ZigzagPreprojective/README.md`, which asks to turn around a chosen arrow by an
algebra isomorphism rescaling one of the exchanged arrows by `-1`, to check that it sends every
local relation to the corresponding relation, and to compose these maps into independence under
every explicit reorientation `Reorient Q σ`, including in characteristic two. See Crawley-Boevey,
*Quiver algebras, weighted projective lines, and the Deligne--Simpson problem*, Section 1.
