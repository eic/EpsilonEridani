# The `D₄` quiver has finite representation type

The Tits form of the `D₄` quiver is positive definite (`EpsilonEridani.Quiver.D4.titsForm_posDef`), so
`EpsilonEridani.isFiniteRepType_of_titsForm_posDef` applies: over every field it has only finitely many
finite-dimensional indecomposable representations, at most as many as the twelve positive roots
counted by `EpsilonEridani.Quiver.D4.card_positiveRoots`.

This is the first case of the affirming half of Gabriel's dichotomy that is not settled by an
explicit classification. The `A₂` quiver was: `EpsilonEridani.isFiniteRepType_kronecker` reads its finite
representation type off the list of its three indecomposables, in
`EpsilonEridani.card_skeleton_indecomposable_kronecker`. No such list is available for `D₄`, and none is
needed; the bound comes from the Tits form alone.

The bound is an inequality rather than the equality `12`, because the surjectivity half of the
Gabriel correspondence -- that every positive root is the dimension vector of an indecomposable --
is not yet available. It is what would turn this into the count milestone of Layer 5.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.isFiniteRepType_d4`: **the `D₄` quiver has finite representation type over every
  field.**
* `EpsilonEridani.card_skeleton_indecomposable_d4_le`: it has at most twelve finite-dimensional
  indecomposable representations up to isomorphism, one for each positive root of `D₄`.

## References

This is the affirming half of the “`D₄` quiver” worked example of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/QuiverRepresentations/README.md`, whose Layer 5 count
milestone asks for the twelve indecomposables of `D₄`. See Assem--Simson--Skowroński, *Elements of
the Representation Theory of Associative Algebras* I, Ch. VII.

/-- **The `D₄` quiver has finite representation type over every field.** Its Tits form is positive
definite, so `EpsilonEridani.isFiniteRepType_of_titsForm_posDef` bounds the isomorphism classes of its
finite-dimensional indecomposables by the roots of that form. -/

/-- **The `D₄` quiver has at most twelve finite-dimensional indecomposable representations up to

this an equality; the inequality is what the injectivity of the dimension vector already gives. -/
