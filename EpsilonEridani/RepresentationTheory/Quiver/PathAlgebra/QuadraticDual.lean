# Quadratic duality for path algebras

A quadratic algebra presented on a quiver `Q` is `kQ / (R)` for a space `R` of `k`-linear
combinations of paths of length two. Its **quadratic dual** is presented on the opposite quiver by
the orthogonal complement `R^⊥` of `R` for the pairing which makes the paths of length two an
orthonormal family: the arrow space of the opposite quiver is dual to the arrow space of `Q`
through the dual basis of the arrows, and the induced pairing of length-two paths is the diagonal
one.

The path algebra of the opposite quiver is the opposite algebra `(kQ)ᵐᵒᵖ`, and this file uses the
latter directly, so that the orthogonal complement `R^⊥` is a space of length-two elements of `kQ`
and the dual algebra is

```text
(kQ)ᵐᵒᵖ / (op R^⊥).
```

Working on the opposite side is not a convention that can be dropped: a length-two path `b a` of
`Q`, read later-factor-first, pairs with the dual arrows in the order `a* b*`, which is a path of
the opposite quiver. For a quiver with an involutive reversal of arrows the two sides are
identified by `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.reverseOpAlgEquiv`, and the dual algebra can then be presented
back on `Q` itself.

The pairing is defined on the whole path algebra, not just on its degree-two piece: it is the
pairing of `EpsilonEridani.pathAlgebraBasis` with itself, so the coordinate of an element on a path is its
pairing with that path. Restricting the orthogonality condition to degree two is what
`EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.quadraticOrthogonal` does.

## Implementation notes

`EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.pathPairing` is `Module.Basis.toDual` of the path basis with the decidable
equality of paths fixed classically. Fixing it is what keeps `DecidableEq (Quiver.TotalPath Q)` out
of the signatures below, which no quiver supplies; the pairing itself does not depend on the
choice.

Duality here is taken through the path basis: `R^⊥` is the annihilator of `R` inside the
degree-two part of `kQ` itself, and the degree-one part of `(kQ)ᵐᵒᵖ` is the span of the dual
arrows. That span is *all* of the dual of the arrow module exactly when the quiver has finitely
many arrows, `[∀ a b : Q, Finite (a ⟶ b)]`: a free module is identified with its full linear dual
by its dual basis only in finite rank. Accordingly, the pairing and orthogonal-complement API is
stated for arbitrary quivers, as `Submodule.dualAnnihilator` carries no finiteness hypothesis,
while the named quadratic-dual ideal, algebra, and universal-property API assumes finite arrow
types. That hypothesis delimits
what those names mean rather than entering their construction, so it is carried as an
underscore-named instance argument on `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.quadraticDualIdeal`, from which the rest
of the dual API inherits it. The dual relation ideal needs nothing more, while the quadratic dual
algebra and its universal property additionally assume `[Finite Q]`, which the unit of the path
algebra needs.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.pathPairing`: the pairing of the path algebra with itself for which the
  paths are an orthonormal family.
* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.quadraticOrthogonal`: the orthogonal complement `R^⊥` inside the degree-two
  piece.
* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.quadraticDualIdeal` and `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.quadraticDual`: the relation
  ideal of the quadratic dual inside `(kQ)ᵐᵒᵖ`, and the quadratic dual algebra, with quotient map
  `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.quadraticDualMk` and universal property
  `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.quadraticDualLift`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.pathPairing_apply_ofPath` and
  `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.pathPairing_ofPath_apply`: pairing with a path reads off the coordinate on
  it.
* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.mem_quadraticOrthogonal_span_iff`: orthogonality to a spanning set of
  relations suffices.
