# Cyclic derivatives in a path algebra

Let `a : i ⟶ j` be an arrow of a finite quiver `Q`. The **cyclic derivative** `∂_a` is the
linear endomorphism of the path algebra `kQ` which, on a cycle, deletes one occurrence of `a` and
reads the rest of the cycle starting just after it, summed over all occurrences of `a`: if the
cycle traverses `v`, then `a`, then `u`, the occurrence contributes the path traversing `u` and
then `v`, a path from `j` back to `i`. In Tau Ceti's later-factor-first convention this
contribution is the product `ofPath v * ofPath u`. A path which is not a cycle has no such
rearrangement and has cyclic derivative `0`. Cyclic derivatives of a potential `W`, a linear
combination of cycles, are the relations of the Jacobian algebra of `(Q, W)` and the
differentials of the reverse arrows in its three-dimensional Ginzburg differential graded algebra.

The basic identity satisfied by cyclic derivatives is

```text
∑_a a ∂_a(x) = ∑_a ∂_a(x) a,
```

the sums running over all arrows of `Q`, for every `x ∈ kQ`. On a cycle both sides are the sum of
all its rotations, one for each of its arrows. The identity holds vertex by vertex as well: the
arrows `a` with head `v` on the left and those with tail `v` on the right give equal sums. This
is what makes the square of the three-dimensional Ginzburg differential vanish on the adjoined
loops.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.cyclicDerivative`: the cyclic derivative `∂_a` with respect to an arrow.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.vertexIdempotent_mul_cyclicDerivative` and
  `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.cyclicDerivative_mul_vertexIdempotent`: the cyclic derivative with respect
  to `a : i ⟶ j` lies in the corner of `kQ` of paths from `j` to `i`.
* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.cyclicDerivative_ofPath`: the cyclic derivative of a cycle is the sum, over
  the occurrences of the arrow, of the rotated remainders.
* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.cyclicDerivative_ofPath_of_ne`: a path which is not a cycle has cyclic
  derivative `0`.
* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.cyclicDerivative_mul_comm`: **the cyclic derivative is invariant under
  cyclic permutation**, `∂_a(xy) = ∂_a(yx)`.
* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.cyclicDerivative_ofArrow_self` and
  `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.cyclicDerivative_ofArrow_of_ne`: the cyclic derivatives of an arrow.
* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.sum_ofArrow_mul_cyclicDerivative_eq_sum_cyclicDerivative_mul_ofArrow`:
  **the local cyclic identity** at a vertex `v`,
  `∑_{head a = v} a ∂_a(x) = ∑_{tail a = v} ∂_a(x) a`.
* `EpsilonEridani.PathAlgebra.sum_sum_sum_ofArrow_mul_cyclicDerivative_comm`: **the global cyclic
  identity** `∑_a a ∂_a(x) = ∑_a ∂_a(x) a`.
