# Parameter measurability of the inverse-Wishart family

This file proves that `EpsilonEridani.Probability.inverseWishartMeasure` is measurable jointly in its real
degree
and scale matrix.
The scale is first presented by all its coordinates,
as required for a matrix-parameterized probability kernel.
A second theorem restricts the scale to the symmetric-matrix carrier.

These results are what is needed to use the inverse-Wishart law as a probability kernel
whose degree and scale are themselves random, for instance as a conjugate prior in hierarchical
models.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measurable_inverseWishartMeasure` gives joint measurability in the degree and
  all
  coordinates of the scale matrix.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measurable_inverseWishartMeasure_selfAdjoint` gives the corresponding result
  when the
  scale ranges over the symmetric-matrix carrier.

/-- **Parameter measurability of the inverse-Wishart law.** The law is measurable jointly in its
