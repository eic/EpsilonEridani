# Fisher's F law as a ratio of independent chi-squared variables

Fisher's F law is defined in `EpsilonEridani/Probability/Distributions/FisherSnedecor/Basic.lean` as the
image of `betaMeasure (m / 2) (n / 2)` under the beta-to-F transformation
`u ↦ (n / m) * u / (1 - u)`.  This file justifies that definition by identifying the law with the
classical ratio it is named for: for independent chi-squared variables `U` and `V` with `m` and
`n` degrees of freedom, the variance ratio `(U / m) / (V / n)` has the law
`fisherSnedecorMeasure m n`.

The identification is stated in two parametrizations.  A chi-squared law with `k` degrees of
freedom is the gamma law of shape `k / 2` and rate `1 / 2`, and a ratio is unchanged by a common
scaling of its two arguments, so the gamma form `map_scaled_div_gammaMeasure` covers all gamma
variables with a common rate, at the price of writing the degrees of freedom as `2 * a` and
`2 * b`.  The chi-squared form `map_scaled_div_chiSquaredMeasure` is its specialisation to the
classical parameters, and is the statement to use for a variance ratio.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.map_scaled_div_gammaMeasure` — the pushforward of a product of gamma laws
  with a common rate along the scaled quotient is Fisher's F law;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.map_scaled_div_chiSquaredMeasure` — the same statement for chi-squared
  laws, in the classical degrees-of-freedom parametrization;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.hasLaw_fisherSnedecor_of_gammaMeasure` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.hasLaw_fisherSnedecor_of_chiSquared` — the random-variable forms.
