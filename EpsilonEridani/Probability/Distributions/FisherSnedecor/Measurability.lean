# Parameter measurability of Fisher's F distribution

This file proves that the Fisher--Snedecor law is a measurable function of its two degrees of
freedom. Consequently, measurable numerator and denominator parameters can be used to form a
probability kernel whenever they lie in the positive range.

Joint measurability of the density is exposed alongside the measure-level result, so both the law
and its density can be composed with measurable parameter maps.

## Main results

* `measurable_uncurry_fisherSnedecorPDF` — joint measurability of the density.
* `measurable_fisherSnedecorMeasure` — joint parameter measurability of the family of measures.
