# Density API for the Cauchy distribution

This file connects nondegenerate Cauchy laws to `HasPDF` and identifies `pdf` and the
Radon--Nikodym derivative at every scale, including the singular zero-scale boundary.

`γ ≠ 0` is required. The zero-scale law is `Measure.dirac x₀`, which is singular with respect to
`volume`. -/

/-- The Radon--Nikodym derivative of a Cauchy law is `cauchyPDF`, at **every** scale.

No nondegeneracy hypothesis is needed. At zero scale the law is `Measure.dirac x₀`, singular with
respect to `volume`, so the derivative vanishes almost everywhere, and `cauchyPDF x₀ 0` vanishes
too. -/
