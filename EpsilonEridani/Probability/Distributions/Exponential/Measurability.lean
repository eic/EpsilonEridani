# Parameter measurability for the exponential distribution

Measurability in the rate lets measurable rate maps produce measurable measure-valued
exponential families, in particular kernels. It follows from the shape-one Gamma family.

/-- **The exponential family is measurable in its rate.**

`expMeasure r` is `gammaMeasure 1 r`, so this is `measurable_gammaMeasure` along the line `a = 1`.
