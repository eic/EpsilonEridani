# Elementary theory of the exponential distribution

This file completes the elementary moment, transform, and tail API for Mathlib's exponential
measure, parametrized by its rate. For a positive rate `r`, it evaluates all moments, identifies
the exact exponential-moment domain, computes the moment- and cumulant-generating functions and the
characteristic function, and deduces the mean and variance. It also establishes the memoryless
property and computes the law of the minimum of independent exponentials.

**Moments come from one formula.** `integral_pow_expMeasure` computes every moment,
`∫ x ^ n ∂(expMeasure r) = n ! / r ^ n`, and the mean and second moment are its `n = 1` and `n = 2`
specializations.

**The exponential law is the shape-one Gamma law.** Mathlib defines `expMeasure r` as
`gammaMeasure 1 r`, so the moments, the exponential-integrability domain, and the transforms are
the `a = 1` cases of the Gamma results in `EpsilonEridani.Probability.Distributions.Gamma.Basic` and
`EpsilonEridani.Probability.Distributions.Gamma.CharFun`, rewritten into their exponential closed forms.

## Main results

* `integrable_expMeasure_iff`, `integral_expMeasure_eq` — integrability and integration against
  the exponential law, transferred to the real density;
* `integrable_pow_expMeasure` — every moment is integrable, for `0 < r`;
* `integral_pow_expMeasure` — the `n`-th moment, `n ! / r ^ n`, for `0 < r`;
* `integral_id_expMeasure`, `integral_sq_expMeasure` — the mean and the second moment;
* `variance_id_expMeasure` — the variance `(r ^ 2)⁻¹`;
* `integrable_exp_mul_expMeasure_iff` — exact exponential integrability threshold `t < r`;
* `integrableExpSet_id_expMeasure` — exact domain `(-∞, r)`;
* `mgf_id_expMeasure` — moment-generating function `r / (r - t)`;
* `cgf_id_expMeasure` — cumulant-generating function `log (r / (r - t))`;
* `charFun_expMeasure` — characteristic function `(r : ℂ) / (r - I * t)`;
* `measureReal_Ioi_expMeasure`, `measure_Ioi_expMeasure` — tail probabilities;
* `memoryless_expMeasure` — the conditional tail is unchanged by elapsed time;
* `map_min_expMeasure` — the minimum map sends a product of exponential laws to the exponential
  law whose rate is the sum of the rates;
* `hasLaw_min_expMeasure_of_indepFun` — minimum of independent exponentials;
* `hasLaw_min_iid_expMeasure` — minimum of `d` i.i.d. exponentials of rate `r` is exponential of
  rate `d * r`.
* `nnrealExpMeasure` — the exponential measure transported to `ℝ≥0`.
