# Moment-generating functions of Gaussian linear functionals

This file proves that every almost everywhere measurable continuous linear functional of a
Gaussian measure has finite exponential moments of every real order and computes its
moment-generating function. It then specializes the general result to inner products against a
multivariate Gaussian vector, expressing the variance as the covariance-matrix quadratic form.

The general results require no norm on the source space. Almost everywhere measurability of
the functional suffices; the default proof handles continuous functionals when open sets are
measurable, including sigma algebras larger than the Borel sigma algebra.

## Main results

* `ProbabilityTheory.IsGaussian.integrableExpSet_dual` identifies the exponential-integrability
  domain of an almost everywhere measurable continuous linear functional of a Gaussian measure
  with all of `ℝ`.
* `ProbabilityTheory.IsGaussian.mgf_dual` computes the moment-generating function of an almost
  everywhere measurable continuous linear functional of a Gaussian measure from its mean and
  variance.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.integrableExpSet_inner_multivariateGaussian` gives the exact domain for a
  directional
  functional of a multivariate Gaussian.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.mgf_inner_multivariateGaussian` gives the corresponding closed formula.
