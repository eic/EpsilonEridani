# Parameter measurability of multivariate Gaussian distributions

This file records joint measurability of the multivariate Gaussian law when its raw matrix
parameter is supplied by its entries.  This coordinate form lets a measurable random mean and
matrix-valued parameter define a measure-valued kernel without first bundling the matrix.

## Main result

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measurable_multivariateGaussian` — the Gaussian law is jointly measurable in
  its mean
  and every coordinate of its raw matrix parameter.

/-- The multivariate Gaussian law is jointly measurable in its mean and every coordinate of its
raw matrix parameter.  When the matrix is positive semidefinite it is the covariance matrix;
otherwise `multivariateGaussian` is the Dirac measure at the mean. -/
