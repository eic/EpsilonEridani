# The extremes of an independent identically distributed family

Let `X : ι → Ω → ℝ` be an independent family over a nonempty finite index type, all of whose
members have the same law `μ`. This file computes the law of the two extremes of the family: the
maximum `Finset.univ.sup' Finset.univ_nonempty fun i => X i ω` and the minimum
`Finset.univ.inf' Finset.univ_nonempty fun i => X i ω`. Writing `d = Fintype.card ι`, the
cumulative distribution functions are `(cdf μ x) ^ d` and `1 - (1 - cdf μ x) ^ d`.

Both extremes are taken over `Finset.univ` together with its nonemptiness proof, so neither
formula acquires the default value that an empty family would force on a `Finset.sup` or a
`Finset.inf`: `d = 0` never occurs.

**One event identity does the work.** The maximum is at most `x` exactly when every member is
(`Finset.sup'_le_iff`), and `x` is below the minimum exactly when it is below every member
(`Finset.lt_inf'_iff`). Independence turns each of those intersections into a product of `d`
equal factors, which is where the two powers come from. The minimum is then read off its
complementary event, which is why its formula is the one with the two subtractions.

`cdf_min_iid` specialises to the exponential family as `hasLaw_min_iid_expMeasure`: the minimum
of `d` i.i.d. exponentials of rate `r` is exponential of rate `d * r`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measure_setOf_max_le_iid`, `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measureReal_setOf_max_le_iid`
  — the maximum is at most `x` with probability `(cdf μ x) ^ d`;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measure_setOf_lt_min_iid`,
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measureReal_setOf_min_le_iid` — the minimum exceeds `x` with probability
  `(1 - cdf μ x) ^ d`, hence is at most `x` with probability `1 - (1 - cdf μ x) ^ d`;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.cdf_max_iid`, `EpsilonEridani.Probability.cdf_min_iid` — the same two formulas for
  the laws of the two extremes.

Only the two extremes are treated; a general theory of order statistics is not.
