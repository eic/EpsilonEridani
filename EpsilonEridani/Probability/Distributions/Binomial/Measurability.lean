# Parameter measurability for the binomial distribution

Joint measurability in the number of trials and success probability lets measurable parameter
maps produce measurable measure-valued binomial families, in particular kernels.

/-- **The binomial family is measurable in its number of trials and its success probability.**

`ProbabilityTheory.binomial_eq_sum_dirac` writes `Bin(n, p)` as a finite weighted sum of Dirac
measures whose weights are polynomial in `p`, so each fibre `n` is measurable in `p`, and `ℕ` is
countable and discrete. -/
