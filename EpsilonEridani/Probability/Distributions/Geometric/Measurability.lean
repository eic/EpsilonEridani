# Parameter measurability for the geometric distribution

Measurability in the success probability lets measurable parameter maps produce measurable
measure-valued geometric families, in particular kernels, including the zero-parameter boundary.

/-- **The geometric family is measurable in its success probability.**

At `p = 0` the law is `Measure.dirac 0`; the result covers this boundary as well as nonzero success
probabilities. -/
