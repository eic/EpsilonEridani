# Parameter measurability of the Dirichlet distribution

The Dirichlet law depends measurably on its concentration vector.  Thus a measurable random
concentration vector can be composed with `dirichletMeasure` to give a measure-valued kernel.

The result covers the totalized family: the measure is zero when the coordinate type is empty or a
concentration parameter is nonpositive, while on the valid region it is the normalized image of a
finite product of Gamma laws.

## Main result

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measurable_dirichletMeasure` gives joint measurability in every
  concentration coordinate.
