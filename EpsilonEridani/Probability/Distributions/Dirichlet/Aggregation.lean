# Aggregation of Dirichlet coordinates

Merging the coordinates of a Dirichlet vector along a surjection `f : ι → κ`, by replacing the
coordinates in each fibre of `f` by their total, again gives a Dirichlet vector: the
concentration parameters are merged the same way.  Surjectivity is what keeps every merged
parameter positive.  If `ι` is empty then so is `κ`, and the statement degenerates to an identity
between two zero measures, since `dirichletMeasure` has no probability law to offer on an empty
index type.

Aggregation is how a Dirichlet model is coarsened, and it is the source of the laws of the blocks
of a Dirichlet vector: the law of the total mass carried by a set of coordinates is the
two-coordinate case of the aggregation law, and the covariance of two coordinates is read off the
variance of their total, which is again a case of it.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.map_euclideanFiberSum_dirichletMeasure` is the aggregation law.

Its random-variable form is `MeasureTheory.MeasurePreserving.fun_comp_hasLaw` applied to the
aggregation law.

/-! ### The aggregation law -/

/-- **Aggregation law for the Dirichlet distribution.** Replacing the coordinates in each fibre
of a surjection `f` by their total gives the Dirichlet law whose concentration parameters are the
fibre totals of the original ones.  On an empty index type, where `dirichletMeasure` is the zero
measure, this is the identity between two zero measures. -/
