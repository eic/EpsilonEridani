# The cumulative distribution function of a gamma law

This file computes `ProbabilityTheory.cdf (gammaMeasure a r)` in closed form: for a positive
shape `a` and a positive rate `r` it is the regularized lower incomplete gamma function
`EpsilonEridani.regularizedGamma` read at the rate-scaled point, `P(a, r * x)`.

This is the gamma entry of the closed-form cdf target of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/StandardDistributions/README.md`, Layer 2.

The identity holds for every real `x`, with no sign hypothesis: below the support both sides
vanish, because `EpsilonEridani.regularizedGamma` is extended by `0` there. That agreement at the
clamping convention is the reason the roadmap prescribes the totalizations it does.

The computation is one change of variables. Mathlib's
`ProbabilityTheory.cdf_gammaMeasure_eq_integral` presents the cdf as the integral of
`gammaPDFReal a r` over `Set.Iic x`; the density vanishes below
the origin, so for `0 < x` that integral is the interval integral over `0..x`. Collecting the rate
into the variable, the integrand becomes `Γ(a)⁻¹ * r * ((r * t) ^ (a - 1) * exp (-(r * t)))`, so
`intervalIntegral.integral_comp_mul_left` at `c = r` turns it into
`Γ(a)⁻¹ * ∫ u in 0..r * x, u ^ (a - 1) * exp (-u)`, which is `P(a, r * x)` by definition.

At shape `a = 1` the result recovers Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.cdf_expMeasure_eq`, since
`ProbabilityTheory.expMeasure r` is `gammaMeasure 1 r` and
`EpsilonEridani.regularizedGamma_one` evaluates `P(1, y)` as `1 - exp (-y)`; this is the exponential
completion check of the same layer.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.cdf_gammaMeasure_eq` — the closed-form cdf `P(a, r * x)`;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measureReal_Iic_gammaMeasure` — the same in measure form;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measureReal_Ioc_gammaMeasure` — the mass of a bounded interval, as a
  difference of two
  values of `P(a, ·)`;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measureReal_Ioi_gammaMeasure` — the upper tail `1 - P(a, r * x)`;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.continuous_cdf_gammaMeasure` — the cdf is continuous, so a gamma law has no
  atoms;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measureReal_le_of_hasLaw_gammaMeasure` — the random-variable corollary.
