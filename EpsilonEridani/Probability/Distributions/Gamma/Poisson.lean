# Gamma mixtures of Poisson distributions

Mixing a Poisson rate against a Gamma law produces a negative-binomial distribution. More
precisely, a Gamma mixing law of shape `r` and rate `p / (1 - p)` gives the negative-binomial law
of shape `r` and success probability `p`.

The proof compares singleton masses. The Poisson mass contributes `exp (-x) * x ^ k / k!` to
the Gamma density, changing its rate from `p / (1 - p)` to `1 / (1 - p)` and its shape from `r`
to `r + k`. Euler's Gamma integral then gives exactly the negative-binomial mass.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.bind_gammaMeasure_poissonMeasure` — a Gamma mixture of Poisson laws is
  negative-binomial.
* `Real.gammaKernel_mul_exp_mul_pow_div_factorial` — the pointwise algebra it runs on: at a
  nonzero point, `c ^ r / Γ r * x ^ (r - 1) * exp (-(c * x))` times `exp (-x) * x ^ k / k !`
  collects into `c ^ r / (Γ r * k !) * (x ^ (r + k - 1) * exp (-((c + 1) * x)))`. The identity is
  algebraic — it carries no positivity hypotheses — and the mixture below supplies the
  probabilistic reading of its two sides.

/-- Collecting `c ^ r / Γ r * x ^ (r - 1) * exp (-(c * x))` against `exp (-x) * x ^ k / k !` at a
nonzero point: the two powers of `x` and the two exponentials each combine, leaving
`x ^ (r + k - 1) * exp (-((c + 1) * x))` under the constant `c ^ r / (Γ r * k !)`.

The identity is algebraic. Nothing here is assumed positive except that `x` is nonzero, so neither
side need be a probability density, and the surviving constant is `c ^ r / (Γ r * k !)` rather than
the `(c + 1) ^ (r + k) / Γ (r + k)` that would normalise the `x`-dependent factor into a gamma
kernel of shape `r + k` and rate `c + 1`. The gamma--Poisson mixture below instantiates the
identity pointwise at whatever rate its gamma law carries, and it is there that the two factors
are the densities their shapes suggest. -/
-- The factors are written out rather than as `gammaPDFReal` and `poissonPMFReal`: the former
-- carries an `if 0 ≤ x` guard that is not definitional at a bound variable, and the latter is
-- indexed by `ℝ≥0`, so either would cost the consumer a congruence step under its integral.
