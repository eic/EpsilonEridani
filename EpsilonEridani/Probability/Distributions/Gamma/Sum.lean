# Finite sums of independent gamma variables

The gamma family is closed under sums of independent variables sharing a rate: adding two of them
adds their shapes, which is `EpsilonEridani.Probability.gammaMeasure_conv_gammaMeasure`.  This file
iterates that
identity over a nonempty finite family, so that a sum of independent gamma variables with a common
positive rate has the gamma law whose shape is the total of the individual shapes.

Splitting a gamma vector into a coordinate and the total of the remaining coordinates is the
elementary use of this closure; combined with the Gamma--Beta change of variables it produces the
coordinate marginals of the Dirichlet distribution.

## Main result

* `ProbabilityTheory.iIndepFun.hasLaw_sum_gammaMeasure` — a nonempty finite sum of independent
  gamma
  variables with a common rate is gamma with the summed shape.
