# Parameter measurability for the Beta distribution

Joint measurability in the two shape parameters lets measurable parameter maps produce
measurable measure-valued Beta families, in particular kernels.

/-- `ProbabilityTheory.beta` is measurable in its two parameters.

It is `Real.Gamma α * Real.Gamma β / Real.Gamma (α + β)`. No positivity is assumed;
measurability concerns the total function, including junk values at the poles of `Real.Gamma`. -/
