# Densities from laws presented as `withDensity`

Two bridges from a law given as `μ.withDensity f` to Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.HasPDF` and `pdf`,
together with three bridges for a law presented by a nonnegative real-valued density:
`integrable_withDensity_ofReal_iff` and `integral_withDensity_ofReal` reduce integrability and
integration under such a law to the density-weighted function against the reference measure, and
`measureReal_withDensity_ofReal` computes the real mass of a measurable set as the integral of the
density over it.

Several of Mathlib's continuous scalar families can be *presented* as `withDensity` measures — some
by definition, others only away from a degenerate parameter — and so can laws Tau Ceti builds on top
of them, but none is connected to `HasPDF`. These theorems make that connection once, so no
individual family has to repeat the `hasPDF_of_map_eq_withDensity hX.aemeasurable … hX.map_eq`
plumbing, and the family files do not each re-prove the same density integral and mass identities.

The file is deliberately neutral: it mentions no particular distribution, so a module defining one
family can import it without acquiring the others.

## Main results

* `hasPDF_of_hasLaw_withDensity` — a law presented as `μ.withDensity f` gives `HasPDF`;
* `pdf_eq_of_hasLaw_withDensity` — and its density is `f`;
* `integrable_withDensity_ofReal_iff` — under a law `μ.withDensity (ENNReal.ofReal ∘ f)`, a
  function is integrable iff `f`-weighted against the reference measure it is;
* `integral_withDensity_ofReal` — and its integral is the integral of the `f`-weighted integrand;
* `measureReal_withDensity_ofReal` — the real mass of a measurable set on which the density `f` is
  nonnegative and integrable is its integral over that set.

The density bridges are stated for an arbitrary codomain and codomain measure, since neither proof
uses anything about `ℝ` or `volume`, and both ask only for `AEMeasurable f μ`.

Needs `[SigmaFinite μ]` on the *codomain* measure — satisfied by `volume` — and nothing on the

/-- Under a law presented by a real-valued density `ρ`, a function is integrable iff its scalar
product with `ρ` is integrable against the reference measure. The density need only be nonnegative
a.e.; the `ℝ≥0∞`-valued density used in the presentation is its `ENNReal.ofReal` lift. -/

/-- Under a law presented by a real-valued density `ρ`, integration is integration of the
`ρ`-weighted integrand against the reference measure. This is the integral counterpart of
`EpsilonEridani.Probability.integrable_withDensity_ofReal_iff`, and it needs no integrability
hypothesis: when the integrand is not integrable both sides are `0`.

It specializes Mathlib's `integral_withDensity_eq_integral_toReal_smul₀` to densities of the form
`ENNReal.ofReal ∘ ρ`, where the `toReal` of the density reduces to `ρ` itself. -/
