# Conditioning Markov exchangeability on the initial state

Conditioning on a null-measurable initial-state event scales the mass of every finite path
starting there and gives zero mass to paths starting elsewhere. Hence it preserves Markov
exchangeability. The conditional path-mass formula gives the same mass to paths with the same
initial state and transition counts, establishing Markov exchangeability of the conditional law.
Null-measurability is all that is asked of the event, so conditioning on a single initial state
needs no hypothesis beyond the a.e. measurability that Markov exchangeability already bundles.
