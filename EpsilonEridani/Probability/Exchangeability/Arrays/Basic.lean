# Exchangeable arrays

A doubly indexed array `X : ℕ × ℕ → Ω → α` carries two symmetry notions, and they are genuinely
different:

* `SeparatelyExchangeable μ X` — the law of the array is unchanged when the two axes are permuted
  **independently**, by `(i, j) ↦ (σ i, τ j)`;
* `JointlyExchangeable μ X` — the law is unchanged when the **same** permutation is applied to both
  axes, by `(i, j) ↦ (σ i, σ j)`.

Separate exchangeability is the stronger notion (`SeparatelyExchangeable.jointlyExchangeable`).
Joint exchangeability is the one to ask of a *symmetric* array `X (i, j) = X (j, i)`, such as the
adjacency array of an exchangeable random graph. Symmetry is a pathwise condition and by itself
gives no invariance of the law; the point is rather that a joint reindexing `(i, j) ↦ (σ i, σ j)`
carries a symmetric array to a symmetric array, whereas permuting the rows alone does not, so joint
exchangeability is the invariance a symmetric array can consistently be asked to have.

The main theorem here is the first step of the standard route to the Aldous–Hoover representation:
the **rows of a separately exchangeable array form an exchangeable sequence of random paths**
(`SeparatelyExchangeable.fullyExchangeable_arrayRow`), so de Finetti's theorem applies to them and
makes them conditionally i.i.d.  That consequence is drawn in `Arrays.DeFinetti`, which is where
this subtree meets the representation theory; the value space of the sequence is path space
`ℕ → α`, standard Borel whenever `α` is, so it needs no hypothesis beyond de Finetti's own.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.pairReindex` — the two-axis analogue of `permReindex`, reindexing an
  array-shaped path by a permutation of each axis.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable`, `EpsilonEridani.Probability.JointlyExchangeable` — the two
  array symmetries.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.arrayRow`, `EpsilonEridani.Probability.arrayCol`,
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.arrayDiag` — the rows and columns of an array, as random elements of path
  space, and its diagonal, as a process.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.jointlyExchangeable` — the implication between the
  two symmetries.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.separatelyExchangeable_iff_map_pairReindex` — the bridge to the array law:
  separate exchangeability is invariance of the law on `ℕ × ℕ → α` under every pair reindexing,
  with `EpsilonEridani.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.measurePreserving_pairReindex` its
  measure-preserving form.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.map_uncurry_pathLaw_arrayRow` — the array law is the uncurried path law of
  the row process.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.separatelyExchangeable_iff_axes` — separate exchangeability splits into
  invariance under row permutations and invariance under column permutations.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.fullyExchangeable_arrayRow` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.fullyExchangeable_arrayCol` — the rows, and the
  columns, of a separately exchangeable array form fully exchangeable sequences of paths.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.JointlyExchangeable.fullyExchangeable_arrayDiag` — the diagonal of a jointly
  exchangeable array is a fully exchangeable sequence.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.ExchangeableFamily.separatelyExchangeable` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.separatelyExchangeable_of_iIndepFun_identDistrib` — the sources: an
  exchangeable family indexed by `ℕ × ℕ`, in particular an i.i.d. array, is separately
  exchangeable.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.jointlyExchangeable_diagIndicatorArray` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.not_separatelyExchangeable_diagIndicatorArray` — the implication between the
  two symmetries is strict, witnessed by the deterministic diagonal-indicator array, whose rows are
  not exchangeable.

## Implementation notes

The two predicates are stated at the level of the whole array law, matching `FullyExchangeable`
rather than the finite-dimensional `Exchangeable`, and quantify over arbitrary permutations of `ℕ`.
This is the formulation that makes the row and column statements pushforwards of one array law
(`map_map_array`), and it is the one Kallenberg uses for infinite arrays. Every symmetry
consequence below is an instance of `SeparatelyExchangeable.map_comp` or
`JointlyExchangeable.map_comp` with a different measurable read-off `F` of the array's sample path.

The a.e.-measurability hypothesis `∀ p, AEMeasurable (X p) μ` is what turns a law identity for the
array into a law identity for a read-off; the definitions themselves are hypothesis-free.

The next law-level consequence of the row and column decompositions is in `Arrays.MixingLaw`: the
law of either directing measure is invariant when every path coordinate is permuted. This is
deliberately weaker than saying that the directing measure is almost surely an exchangeable law,
which is false in general.

`X (i, j) = X (j, i)`: reindexing both axes by the same permutation preserves pathwise symmetry,

it constrains the sample path, not the law. -/
