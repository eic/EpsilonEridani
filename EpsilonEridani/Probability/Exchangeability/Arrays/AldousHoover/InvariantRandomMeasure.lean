# Coded coordinate marginals of an invariant random row law

For a separately exchangeable array, de Finetti supplies a random probability measure `ν` on row
paths. Its law is invariant under permuting the column coordinates, although `ν` itself is not
generally exchangeable almost surely. The invariant-random-measure API turns the one-coordinate
marginals of `ν` into an exchangeable measure-valued sequence.

Because the Giry measurable space on `ProbabilityMeasure α` is not available as a standard Borel
space, the sequence is represented by the measurable injective evaluation code from
`MeasureTheory.Measure.ProbabilityMeasure.Coding`. De Finetti then shows that, conditionally on one
global random law, the coded coordinate marginals are i.i.d. This retains every one-coordinate
marginal of the random row law.

The one-coordinate marginals do not in general recover the row law, since they omit its higher
finite-dimensional marginals. `RandomMeasure.Block` supplies the corresponding factorization for
every positive block width.

## Main result

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.exists_directing_arrayRow_codedCoordinateMarginals`
  -- choose a row directing measure whose coded coordinate marginals are conditionally i.i.d.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.exists_directing_arrayRow_codedBlockMarginals`
  -- the same row directing measure gives a conditional factorization at every positive block
  width.

/-- **The coded coordinate marginals of a row directing measure admit a conditional de Finetti
factorization.** A separately exchangeable array has a row directing measure `ν` such that, under
the law of `ν`, the measurable injective codes of its one-coordinate marginals are conditionally
i.i.d. The conditional directing law is the global parameter at the first level of the

/-- **Every positive-width block marginal of a row directing measure admits a conditional de
Finetti factorization.** A separately exchangeable array has a row directing measure `ν` such that,
under the law of `ν`, the codes of its marginals on consecutive disjoint blocks of any fixed
positive width are conditionally i.i.d. The same `ν` works for every width; the conditional
directing law of the coded blocks may depend on the width. -/
