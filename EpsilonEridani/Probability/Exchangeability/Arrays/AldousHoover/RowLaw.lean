# The random row law of a separate Aldous--Hoover coding

In the separate Aldous--Hoover coding

```text
X i j = g (U, U_row i, U_col j, U_cell i j)
```

the global variable `U` and the column variables `U_col j` are shared by all rows, while each row
`i` reads its own row variable and its own cells. Conditionally on `z = (U, (U_col j)ⱼ)`, the rows
are therefore i.i.d., each distributed as

```text
separateRowLaw g z = Law (j ↦ g (z.1, V, z.2 j, W j)),
```

for a uniform `V` and an independent i.i.d. uniform sequence `W`. So the row directing measure of
a coded array is the random probability measure `separateRowLaw g` evaluated at the global and
column noise (`conditionallyIIDWith_arrayRow_separateArray`), and its row mixing law is the law of
`separateRowLaw g` under uniform noise.

Conversely, the law of an array is determined by the mixing law of its rows, and the mixture
determines the mixing law. Hence an array whose rows have a mixing representative `ν` has the law
of the coding `g` exactly when `ν` has the law of `separateRowLaw g`
(`map_eq_map_separateArray_iff`). This reduces the separate Aldous--Hoover representation of an
array to realizing the law of its row directing measure — a random probability measure on paths
whose law is invariant under column permutations — as the law of such a random row law driven by
one global and i.i.d. column variables.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.AldousHoover.separateRowLaw` — the law of one row of a separate coding given
  its global and column noise.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.AldousHoover.conditionallyIIDWith_arrayRow_separateArray` — the rows of a
  separate coding are conditionally i.i.d. with directing measure the random row law;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.AldousHoover.map_separateRowLaw_noiseMeasure` — its law is the law of
  `separateRowLaw g` under uniform noise;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.AldousHoover.separateRowLaw_colReindex` — permuting columns reindexes
  the row law;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.AldousHoover.map_separateRowLaw_colReindex` — the row mixing law is
  invariant under column permutations;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.AldousHoover.map_eq_map_separateArray_iff` — an array has the law of the
  coding `g` if and only if its row mixing law is that law.

/-- **The random row law of a separate Aldous--Hoover coding.** Given the global variable `z.1` and
the column variables `z.2 j`, this is the law of the row `j ↦ g (z.1, V, z.2 j, W j)` for a
uniform row variable `V` and an independent i.i.d. uniform sequence `W` of cell variables.

It is meaningful for a measurable `g`, which every statement about it assumes; the pushforward of a
probability measure is a probability measure in any case. -/
