# Uniform mixtures of jointly dissociated array laws

Every exchangeable probability law on arrays over a standard Borel space is a measurable mixture
of jointly dissociated ones, with the same array symmetry as the original law and with one uniform
variable on the unit interval as the mixing variable. This isolates the global noise in the
Aldous--Hoover representation: it remains to represent the resulting measurable family by vertex
(row and column) and cell noise.

Both array symmetries are covered. `JointlyExchangeable.exists_dissociated_kernel` and
`SeparatelyExchangeable.exists_jointlyDissociated_kernel` give the mixture as a Markov kernel from
the unit interval, with its composition against volume equal to the original law;
`JointlyExchangeable.exists_dissociated_coding` and
`SeparatelyExchangeable.exists_jointlyDissociated_coding` realize that kernel using a second
independent uniform variable. Their sections retain both the symmetry and joint dissociation, and
their joint pushforward is the original array law. The second variable samples a whole array; it is
not yet resolved into vertex (row and column) and cell variables.

The components of a separately exchangeable law are asserted to be *jointly* dissociated, which is
what dropping the global variable of a separate coding asks of them
(`AldousHoover.exists_map_separateArray_snd_eq_of_jointlyDissociated`).

The construction samples an array from the original law using uniform noise, then takes its
conditional law given the corner tail. Thus it only randomizes a standard Borel array space;
no standard Borel instance for the Giry space of probability measures is needed. Nothing in it
mentions a symmetry, so it is carried out once for an arbitrary property of the conditional laws
(`exists_kernel_of_ae_condExpKernel_arrayTail`, `exists_coding_of_ae_condExpKernel_arrayTail`) and
specialized afterwards.

joint dissociation is the hypothesis that the global-variable-free separate coding
(`AldousHoover.exists_map_separateArray_snd_eq_of_jointlyDissociated`) asks of a component. -/
