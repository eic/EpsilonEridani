# Mixing laws of separately exchangeable arrays

Applying de Finetti's theorem to the rows of a separately exchangeable array gives a random
probability measure on row paths. The remaining column symmetry does not generally make this
random measure exchangeable almost surely. For example, if every row equals one common i.i.d.
random path `Y`, then the row directing measure is `δ_Y`, which is almost surely not an
exchangeable measure.

The correct inherited symmetry is at the level of the **mixing law**. If `ν` is any mixing
representative for the row process, then the law of `ν` is invariant under pushing every measure
forward by a permutation of path coordinates:

```text
μ.map (ω ↦ (ν ω).map (permReindex τ)) = μ.map ν.
```

The proof uses the opposite-axis half of separate exchangeability. Mapping each row path by
`permReindex τ`
preserves the row process's finite-dimensional laws by column exchangeability. The
coordinatewise-map API for `MixedIIDWith` therefore supplies a second mixing representative for
the original row process, and uniqueness of the mixing law identifies their laws. The column
statement is the symmetric argument using row exchangeability.

The existential corollaries retain genuine directing measures: de Finetti supplies
`ConditionallyIIDWith`, while the invariance follows after forgetting only to its mixture
identity. These results are the next law-level input to the separately exchangeable-array branch
of the Aldous–Hoover milestone in `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, Layer 8.

## Main results

* `SeparatelyExchangeable.mixingLaw_map_permReindex_arrayRow_eq` — the row mixing law is invariant
  under coordinate permutations;
* `SeparatelyExchangeable.mixingLaw_map_permReindex_arrayCol_eq` — the symmetric column statement;

Every result here holds of *any* supplied mixing representative; the existential versions, in which
de Finetti produces one, are in `Arrays.DeFinetti`.

/-- **The row mixing law inherits column symmetry.** For any mixing representative `ν` of the
row process, invariance of the array law under the column permutation `τ` implies that pushing
`ν` forward by `τ` does not change its law under `μ`.

This is a statement about the law `μ.map ν`, not an almost-sure assertion that each measure
`ν ω` is exchangeable. The latter is false in general. -/
