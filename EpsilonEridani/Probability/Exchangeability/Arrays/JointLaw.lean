# The directing measure of a separately exchangeable array is equivariant

Applying de Finetti to the rows of a separately exchangeable array produces a directing measure
`ν` on row paths, and `Arrays.MixingLaw` records the symmetry it inherits from the remaining column
freedom: the *law* of `ν` is invariant under pushing every row path forward by a permutation `τ` of
the time coordinate. That statement forgets how `ν` is coupled to the array, and the coupling is
exactly what the next step of the Aldous--Hoover argument has to work with: the column randomness
of the array is carried by `ν`, not by the conditionally i.i.d. rows, so column symmetry has to be
available *after* conditioning on `ν`.

This file supplies the coupled statement. For all permutations `σ` of the rows and `τ` of the
columns,

```text
Law (ν.map (permReindex τ),  (i, j) ↦ X (σ i, τ j))  =  Law (ν,  (i, j) ↦ X (i, j)).
```

Row permutations leave the directing measure alone and column permutations push it forward. Taking
the first marginal recovers the conclusion of
`SeparatelyExchangeable.mixingLaw_map_permReindex_arrayRow_eq` at a directing measure, and taking
the second recovers separate exchangeability itself.

Both refinements are genuine. The statement is *conditional-side*: it is false for an arbitrary
mixing representative, since an independent copy of a directing measure is another mixing
representative with a different coupling to the array, so it must be read off the joint law rather
than the mixture identity. And it is *equivariant* rather than invariant: `ν` is almost surely not
an exchangeable measure — if every row is one common i.i.d. path `Y`, then `ν = δ_Y` — so the
column permutation cannot simply be dropped.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.jointLaw_arrayRow_pairReindex_eq` — the displayed
  identity;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.jointLaw_arrayRow_rowReindex_eq` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.jointLaw_arrayRow_colReindex_eq` — its two axes
  separately;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.exists_directing_arrayRow_jointLaw_equivariant` —
  de Finetti supplies a directing measure with this symmetry;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.jointLaw_arrayCol_pairReindex_eq` — the transposed
  statement for the column directing measure, again with its two axes separately as
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.jointLaw_arrayCol_rowReindex_eq` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.jointLaw_arrayCol_colReindex_eq`.

## Implementation

Everything is deduced from one general fact, `ConditionallyIIDWith.jointPathLaw_eq_of_pathLaw_eq`:
a conditionally i.i.d. process determines the joint law of its directing measure and its path
through the path law alone. The reindexed array has a directing measure for its rows by the two
closure lemmas `ConditionallyIIDWith.comp_injective` (permute the rows) and
`ConditionallyIIDWith.map_values` (permute the time coordinate of each row path), and separate
exchangeability says its row process has the original path law. Transporting the resulting identity
of joint path laws along a measurable reassembly of the array from its row — or column — process
gives the array-level statements.

`arrayRow` and `arrayCol` are ordinary definitions rather than reducible abbreviations, so the
proofs move between a process of paths and the entries of the array through their `@[simp]`
evaluation lemmas rather than by definitional unfolding.

directing measure `ν`, the joint law of `ν` and the array is unchanged when the rows are reindexed

Rows and columns enter differently, and both asymmetries are real: the rows are the coordinates of
the conditionally i.i.d. process that `ν` directs, so permuting them does not disturb `ν`, while
the columns are coordinates *inside* each row path, so permuting them acts on `ν`. -/
