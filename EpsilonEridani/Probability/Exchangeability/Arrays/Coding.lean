# The coding representation of a separately exchangeable array

De Finetti's theorem turns an exchangeable sequence into a fixed measurable function of its
directing measure and independent uniform noise (`deFinetti_coding`). This file does the same for
the rows of a **separately exchangeable array**: an array `X : ℕ × ℕ → Ω → α` over a nonempty
standard Borel state space satisfies

```text
X (i, j)  =ᵈ  f P (ϑ i) j,
```

for the canonical coding map `f = unitIntervalCoding (ℕ → α)`, a single random parameter
`P : ProbabilityMeasure (ℕ → α)` drawn from a mixing law `π`, and an independent i.i.d. uniform
sequence `ϑ` carrying one variable per row. All the randomness of the array beyond the global
parameter sits in the per-row noise, which is the shape the Aldous–Hoover representation takes;
the finer resolution of a row path into a per-column and a per-cell source is not carried out
here, and the column symmetry enters only through the invariance of `π`.

That invariance is what makes the representation exact rather than one-directional. The mixing
law of the rows is invariant under pushing a path law forward by a permutation of the time
coordinate (`SeparatelyExchangeable.mixingLaw_map_permReindex_arrayRow_eq`), and, conversely,
coding *any* mixing law with that invariance produces a separately exchangeable array. So over a
nonempty standard Borel state space, separate exchangeability of an array is exactly codability by
a permutation-invariant mixing law (`separatelyExchangeable_iff_exists_coding`).

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.exists_arrayLaw_eq_map_unitIntervalCoding` — **the
  representation**: the law of a separately exchangeable array is the law of the array coded by a
  permutation-invariant mixing law.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.separatelyExchangeable_unitIntervalCoding` — the converse: the
  array coded by a permutation-invariant mixing law is separately exchangeable.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.separatelyExchangeable_iff_exists_coding` — the resulting
  characterization.

## Implementation

The row process of the coded array is the coded sequence in path space, so its law is the
de Finetti barycenter of the mixing law (`map_prod_unitIntervalCoding_eq_deFinettiBarycenter` at
value space `ℕ → α`). Both array symmetries are therefore read off that barycenter: permuting the
rows is exchangeability of the barycenter (`exchangeableLaw_deFinettiBarycenter`), and permuting
the columns is a coordinatewise pushforward, which by naturality (`map_pi_deFinettiBarycenter`) is
the barycenter of the pushed-forward mixing law. Only the second uses the hypothesis on `π`. The
transport from the row process back to the array is `map_uncurry_pathLaw_arrayRow`, along which
every statement here is read.

The unit interval is written out rather than through the `unitInterval` scoped notation `I`, whose
namespace also carries a `σ` notation that would collide with the permutation names used by the
neighbouring array files.
