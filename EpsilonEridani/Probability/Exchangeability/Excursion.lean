# Reordering the excursions of a Markov exchangeable path

A finite path that starts at a state `a₀` and returns to it splits at its visits to `a₀` into
excursions, and `EpsilonEridani.loopPathAt a₀ bs` spells out the path traversing the excursions
`bs : List (List α)` in the listed order. This file proves that a **Markov exchangeable** process
gives the same mass to every ordering of one list of excursions:

```text
bs ~ bs'  →  prefixLaw μ X (n + 1) {loopPathAt a₀ bs} = prefixLaw μ X (n + 1) {loopPathAt a₀ bs'}
```

Markov exchangeability says that the mass of a finite path depends only on its first state and its
transition counts, and reordering excursions changes neither: every excursion is entered at `a₀`
and left back to `a₀`, so the transitions of the whole loop are those of its excursion loops,
gathered in an order that a permutation of the excursions rearranges
(`EpsilonEridani.transitionCount_loopPathAt_eq_of_perm`).

Every finite path returning to its starting state arises this way
(`EpsilonEridani.exists_loopPathAt`), so the statement is a symmetry of *all* the finite-path masses of
such a process, not of a special family of paths;
`EpsilonEridani.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.exists_excursions_prefixLaw_eq` packages the two together.

This is the finite-path symmetry that Diaconis and Freedman's representation theorem for Markov
exchangeable processes rests on: a recurrent Markov exchangeable process returns to its initial
state infinitely often, so its excursions from that state form a genuine sequence of random
finite paths, and the identities below are that sequence's finite-dimensional exchangeability.
The combinatorial excursion process and its reconstruction of a recurrent path segment are set up
in `EpsilonEridani.Combinatorics.Enumerative.ExcursionProcess`, and
`EpsilonEridani.Probability.Exchangeability.Recurrence.Excursion` adds the recurrence hypothesis at the
process level to assemble the identities below into exchangeability of that process
(`EpsilonEridani.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.exchangeable_excursionProcess`) and to run de Finetti on
it.  Exhibiting the original process as a mixture of Markov chains
(`EpsilonEridani.Probability.MixedMarkovChain`, whose converse direction is
`EpsilonEridani.Probability.MixedMarkovChainWith.markovExchangeable`) is the remaining step.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.prefixLaw_loopPathAt_eq_of_perm`: reordering the
  excursions of a loop does not change its mass.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.prefixLaw_singleton_eq_of_perm_excursions`: the same
  statement read off two finite paths that traverse the same excursions in different orders.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.measure_setOf_loopPathAt_eq_of_perm`: the same statement
  read as an event of the process.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.exists_excursions_prefixLaw_eq`: every finite path that
  returns to its starting state is a loop of excursions avoiding that state, and each reordering
  of them has the same mass.
