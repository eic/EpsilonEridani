# Quantitative finite de Finetti approximation

Let `x : κ → α` be a nonempty finite population. Its empirical distribution is the pushforward
of the uniform law on `κ` by `x`. Sampling `ι` entries from that distribution independently is
therefore the same as choosing a uniform map `ι → κ` and reading the selected entries of `x`.

For a random population with law `ρ`, `sampleWithReplacement ρ` mixes these finite product laws
over `ρ`. The law `sampleWithoutReplacement ρ` already represents every shorter marginal of a
finite exchangeable process. The collision coupling between uniform maps and uniform injective
maps consequently gives, for every measurable event `A`,

```text
prefixLaw μ X m A ≤ sampleWithReplacement (prefixLaw μ X n) A + choose(m, 2) / n
sampleWithReplacement (prefixLaw μ X n) A ≤ prefixLaw μ X m A + choose(m, 2) / n.
```

Thus every `m`-coordinate marginal of an `n`-exchangeable process is quantitatively approximated
by a mixture of `m`-fold product measures of empirical distributions. The bound is deliberately
eventwise rather than packaged in a new total-variation definition.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.empiricalMeasureOfFintype`: the empirical probability measure of a nonempty
  finite population;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.sampleWithReplacement`: the mixture of finite powers of those empirical
  measures;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.sampleWithReplacement_eq_bind_pi_empiricalMeasureOfFintype`: its
  product-mixture characterization;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.ExchangeableAt.finiteDeFinetti`: the paired eventwise finite de Finetti
  bound;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.ExchangeableAt.prefixLaw_le_sampleWithReplacement_add` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.ExchangeableAt.sampleWithReplacement_le_prefixLaw_add`: the two sides of
  the finite de Finetti bound.

No material is adapted from `cameronfreer/exchangeability`; that development concerns infinite
exchangeable sequences rather than quantitative finite approximation.
