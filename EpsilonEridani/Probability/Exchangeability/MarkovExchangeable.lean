# Markov exchangeability

A process `X : ℕ → Ω → α` on a countable state space is **Markov exchangeable** — Diaconis and
Freedman's *partial exchangeability* — when two finite paths that start at the same state and make
the same number of transitions from each state to each state are equally likely:

```text
u 0 = v 0  →  transitionCount u = transitionCount v  →  prefixLaw μ X (n + 1) {u} =
  prefixLaw μ X (n + 1) {v}
```

This is the symmetry that a Markov chain has and an exchangeable process has, and it is the
hypothesis of the Diaconis–Freedman representation theorem, which says that a recurrent Markov
exchangeable process is a mixture of Markov chains. This file sets up the notion and its two
sources.

Markov exchangeability is a genuine weakening of exchangeability. Exchangeability asks for
invariance under *all* rearrangements of a finite path, whereas Markov exchangeability asks for it
only between paths sharing a start and a transition-count matrix; the latter class of paths is
strictly smaller, because a rearrangement generally destroys the transition counts. That the
implication `Exchangeable → MarkovExchangeable` nevertheless holds is a conservation law for words:
the transition counts and the first letter already determine the occurrence counts, hence the
rearrangement class (`EpsilonEridani.exists_perm_comp_of_transitionCount_eq`). That the implication is
strict is witnessed by the deterministic 3-cycle, in
`EpsilonEridani/Probability/Exchangeability/ThreeCycle.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.MarkovExchangeable`: the symmetry above.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.Exchangeable.markovExchangeable`: an exchangeable process is Markov
  exchangeable.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.markovExchangeable_iff_prefixLaw_map_perm_eq`: Markov exchangeability is
  invariance of each prefix law under every permutation preserving the initial state and transition
  counts.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.prefixLaw_apply_eq_of_equiv`: more generally, two sets
  of finite paths have the same mass when a transition-count-preserving equivalence pairs them.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.markovExchangeable_of_prefixLaw_singleton_eq`: a process whose finite path
  probabilities factor as an initial weight times a product of transition weights — a Markov chain
  — is Markov exchangeable.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.markovExchangeable_pathLaw_iff`: the process-level and path-law
  formulations agree.

/-- **Permutation-invariance characterization of Markov exchangeability.** A measurable process
is Markov exchangeable exactly when each finite prefix law is invariant under every permutation of
path words that preserves the initial state and every directed transition count.

This is stronger as an interface than equality of singleton masses: it transports arbitrary
events at once. Conversely, swapping any two words in one Markov-exchangeability class recovers the
defining singleton equality. -/
