# Mixed i.i.d.-ness under almost-everywhere changes

`MixedIIDWith μ X ν` is a family of identities between measures built from `X` and `ν` by
`Measure.map` and `Measure.bind`, so it sees both arguments only modulo `μ`-a.e. equality. This file
records the two resulting congruences: the process may be changed coordinatewise a.e., and the
mixing representative may be changed a.e. — the latter subject to the measurability the definition
builds in, which is not itself an a.e. notion and so must be supplied for the new witness.

Together these make the predicate usable after the routine null-set surgery that produces, say, a
measurable version of an a.e. measurable coordinate. The conditional analogues are in
`ConditionallyIID/Congr.lean`, and the symmetry predicates are handled in
`Exchangeability/Congr.lean`.

## Main results

* `MixedIIDWith.congr_process`, `MixedIID.congr_process` — coordinatewise a.e. equal processes.
* `MixedIIDWith.congr_mixingRepresentative` — an a.e. equal, measurable mixing representative. A
  merely a.e. measurable replacement `ν'` is handled by applying it at `hν'.mk ν'`, with
  `hν'.measurable_mk` and `hνν'.trans hν'.ae_eq_mk`.

is again a mixing representative, provided it is measurable: the mixture side of the defining
identity is a `Measure.bind` over `μ`, which only sees `ν` a.e., but measurability of the witness is
part of the predicate and is not an a.e. notion. -/
