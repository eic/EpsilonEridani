# Recurrence and successor arrays

For a recurrent path, the visit times of a visited state are genuine, strictly increasing visits,
and the visit counts along them run through every natural number; so the successor-array row of
such a state is an infinite list of genuine transitions, read off at those times. Rows indexed by
unvisited states remain unconstrained and may contain `Nat.nth`'s junk values.

Combined with `successorArray_def`, which reads a row entry off the visit time, these are the
facts that make every entry of a visited-state row a genuine transition of the path. Recovering
the path from its successor array needs none of this — `pathOfSuccessors_successorArray` inverts
the decomposition of an arbitrary sequence — but the later probabilistic argument, which permutes
the entries within a row, does need them to be real transitions rather than junk.
