# The Diaconis--Freedman representation with a random initial state

The Diaconis--Freedman representation for a recurrent Markov exchangeable process is first
available when its initial state is fixed
(`EpsilonEridani.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.mixedMarkovChain_of_ae_initial_eq`). Conditioning on an
initial state of positive probability preserves recurrence and Markov exchangeability and gives
that fixed-start hypothesis, so the process is a mixture of Markov chains under each such
conditional law. The state space is countable, so these conditional mixtures glue along the
partition by the initial state (`EpsilonEridani.Probability.mixedMarkovChain_of_forall_cond`) into a
single mixture of Markov chains under the original law.

Together with the easy direction `EpsilonEridani.Probability.MixedMarkovChain.markovExchangeable`, this is
the theorem of Diaconis and Freedman: a recurrent process is Markov exchangeable if and only if it
is a mixture of Markov chains.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.mixedMarkovChain_cond_initial`: the conditional
  representation at a positive-probability initial state.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.mixedMarkovChain`: **the Diaconis--Freedman
  representation theorem**, a recurrent Markov exchangeable process is a mixture of Markov chains.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.markovExchangeable_iff_mixedMarkovChain`: for a recurrent process, Markov
  exchangeability and being a mixture of Markov chains are equivalent.

/-- **The Diaconis--Freedman representation theorem.** A recurrent Markov exchangeable process is a
mixture of Markov chains. The initial state may be random: the representations conditional on the
individual initial states are glued into a single pair of mixing witnesses. The measure is finite
and nonzero, as in the gluing theorem `EpsilonEridani.Probability.mixedMarkovChain_of_forall_cond`. -/
