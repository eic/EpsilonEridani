# The excursion process of a recurrent Markov exchangeable process

A recurrent process that starts at a state `a₀` returns to it infinitely often, so its path splits
into an infinite sequence of excursions away from `a₀`. This file assembles that sequence into the
**excursion process** `excursionProcess X a₀`, a process valued in the finite words `List α`, and
proves the theorem the Diaconis–Freedman representation rests on: for a **Markov exchangeable**
process the excursion process is **exchangeable**
(`EpsilonEridani.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.exchangeable_excursionProcess`). De Finetti's theorem then
applies to it, making the excursions conditionally i.i.d. — that step is drawn in
`Recurrence.Representation`, which is where this subtree meets the representation theory, so the
excursion mechanics here stay independent of it.

## How the two symmetries meet

Markov exchangeability constrains **finite-path** events: the mass of a finite path depends only on
its initial state and its transition counts. Exchangeability of the excursion process asks instead
about events of the *excursions*. The bridge is that under recurrence these are the same events.
Prescribing the first `bs.length` excursions of a path starting at `a₀` says exactly that, over the
span `loopSteps bs` of the loop they spell out, the path is the loop word `loopPathAt a₀ bs`
(`EpsilonEridani.eqOn_loopPathAt_iff_excursionPrefix_eq`). Reordering the excursions leaves the initial
state and the transition counts alone, so
`EpsilonEridani.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.measure_setOf_loopPathAt_eq_of_perm` gives the two loops
equal mass, and the finite-dimensional laws of the excursion process are therefore permutation
invariant.

Recurrence is what makes the bridge two-way, and it is a genuine hypothesis: the deterministic walk
of `EpsilonEridani/Probability/Exchangeability/Recurrence/AbsorbedWalk.lean` is Markov exchangeable and
leaves its initial state for good.

Lists carry the natural length-indexed measurable structure of
`EpsilonEridani/MeasureTheory/MeasurableSpace/List.lean`. Over the countable discrete state space here this
structure is discrete, hence standard Borel, so de Finetti's theorem needs no hypothesis beyond the
countability Markov exchangeability already carries.

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.excursionProcess`: the sequence of excursions of a process away from a base
  state.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measurable_excursion`: an excursion is a measurable function of the path.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measure_setOf_excursionPrefix_eq`: for a process making the visit that
  closes the last prescribed excursion, prescribing the first excursions is a finite-path event.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.measure_setOf_excursionPrefix_eq_of_perm`: reordering a
  list of excursions does not change the probability that it is the process's list of first
  excursions.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.exchangeable_excursionProcess`: **the excursion process
  of a recurrent Markov exchangeable process is exchangeable**.
