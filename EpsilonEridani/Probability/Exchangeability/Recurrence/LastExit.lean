# Recurrent prefixes adapted to finite successor reindexings

This file supplies the recurrence step that produces the last-exit condition. A family
`π : α → Equiv.Perm ℕ` of row permutations that moves only finitely many positions on rows attained
by a recurrent path eventually has every such position below the last visit to its row.
Consequently every sufficiently long prefix is `LastExitAdmissible π x`: `π` permutes each used
row prefix within itself and fixes its last position.

This is the bridge between finite-support reduction for row exchangeability and finite last-exit
reconstruction in the Layer 8 Markov-exchangeability milestone of
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`.  The remaining step after this bridge is probabilistic:
use Markov exchangeability to compare the reconstructed finite prefixes and then pass to the full
successor-array law.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.eventually_lastExitAdmissible_of_recurrent` is the pointwise recurrence theorem;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.Recurrent.ae_eventually_lastExitAdmissible` is its process-level form.

No material is adapted from `cameronfreer/exchangeability`, which treats exchangeable rather than
Markov-exchangeable sequences.
