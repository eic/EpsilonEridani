# Reconstructing a recurrent path from its excursions

A recurrent process that starts at `a₀` returns to it infinitely often, so concatenating its
excursions recovers the path: `pathOfExcursions_excursion` is the identity used here, and it needs
exactly that recurrence.  This file turns it into an identity of laws,

```text
pathLaw μ X = (pathLaw of the excursion process).map (pathOfExcursions a₀)
```

and nothing more.

Only that direction is established.  Concatenation is not injective on arbitrary excursion
sequences — a word containing `a₀` is split further when the excursions are read back — so the
converse `excursion_pathOfExcursions` carries the hypothesis that the words avoid `a₀`, and is not
used here.  What the identity above needs is a pushforward along a measurable map that is a.e. left
inverse to reading the excursions off, not a bijection.

The file is deliberately independent of de Finetti: this is a change of variables, and holds
whether or not the excursion law is a mixture.
The representation theorem that identifies that law as a mixture is in `Recurrence.Representation`,
which is the only file in this subtree that reaches the de Finetti summit.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measurable_pathOfExcursions` — concatenation is measurable;
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.pathLaw_eq_map_pathOfExcursions` and its `Recurrent` form — the path law is
  the pushforward of the excursion path law along it.
