# Conditional i.i.d.-ness under almost-everywhere changes

`ConditionallyIIDWith μ X ν` constrains the joint law of `(ν, block)`, a `Measure.map` of `μ`
compared against a `Measure.bind` over `μ`. Both sides see `X` and `ν` only modulo `μ`-a.e.
equality, so the predicate transports along a coordinatewise a.e. change of the process and along
an a.e. change of the directing measure.

The directing-measure congruence is the one that matters in practice. A directing measure is only
ever determined a.e. — that is exactly what `conditionallyIID_ae_unique` says — so any construction
of one is free to be modified on a null set, and without this lemma a mathematically valid witness
becomes unusable at the interfaces that name it. Measurability is not an a.e. notion and is part of
the predicate, so it must be supplied afresh for the new witness.

The mixture-side analogues are in `MixedIID/Congr.lean` and the symmetry predicates are handled in
`Exchangeability/Congr.lean`.

## Main results

* `ConditionallyIIDWith.congr_process`, `ConditionallyIID.congr_process` — coordinatewise a.e. equal
  processes.
* `ConditionallyIIDWith.congr_directing` — an a.e. equal, measurable directing measure. A merely
  a.e. measurable replacement `ν'` is handled by applying it at `hν'.mk ν'`, with
  `hν'.measurable_mk` and `hνν'.trans hν'.ae_eq_mk`.
