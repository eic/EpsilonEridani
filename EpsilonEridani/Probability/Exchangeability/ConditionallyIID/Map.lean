# Maps of conditionally i.i.d. families

Two ways of moving `ConditionallyIID` along a map. Applying a measurable map to the *values* of
every coordinate gives another conditionally i.i.d. family, whose directing measure is the
pushforward of the original one; and a family that is conditionally i.i.d. under a pushforward
`μ.map φ` pulls back along `φ`, in particular from the canonical process on path space to the
original process.

## Main results

* `ConditionallyIIDWith.map_values` — the coordinatewise value pushforward, at a named directing
  measure, together with its existential corollary `ConditionallyIID.map_values`.
* `ConditionallyIIDWith.of_map` — pulling the predicate back along a map `φ` from a pushforward
  `μ.map φ`, with directing measure `ν ∘ φ`.
* `ConditionallyIIDWith.of_pathLaw` — the transfer at a named directing measure, identifying the
  transferred witness as `ν ∘ (ω ↦ fun i => X i ω)`.
* `conditionallyIID_of_conditionallyIID_pathLaw` — its existential corollary.

## Implementation

These are the conditional counterparts of `MixedIIDWith.map_values` and
`mixedIID_of_mixedIID_pathLaw`; the roadmap refers to the second as `conditionallyIID_transfer`,
and asks for the first as the closure of each symmetry class under a coordinatewise pushforward
(`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, Layer 0). Where the mixture predicate needs only the
block identity to move, the conditional predicate carries the directing measure along as a
coordinate of a joint law, so `map_values` transports the *whole* disintegration identity along
`(Q, x) ↦ (Q.map f, f ∘ x)`. That map splits as a product, which is what lets
`Measure.map_prod_map` reduce the mixture side to `Measure.map_dirac'` on the tag and
`Measure.pi_map_pi` on the sampled block.

The path-law transfer is the pullback along the path map `φ ω = fun i => X i ω`, under which the
directing measure transfers as `ν ∘ φ`. Its purpose is to remove `[StandardBorelSpace Ω]` from
statements proved on path space, which is standard Borel whenever the state space is.

/-- **Conditional i.i.d.-ness is preserved by a coordinatewise measurable map of the value
space**, at a named directing measure: if `X` is conditionally i.i.d. with directing measure `ν`,
then `fun i ω => f (X i ω)` is conditionally i.i.d. with directing measure the pushforward
`fun ω => (ν ω).map f`.

Unlike its mixture counterpart `MixedIIDWith.map_values`, this moves the joint law of the directing
measure and a block, so the transported map acts on the tag as well: it is
`(Q, x) ↦ (Q.map f, f ∘ x)`. -/
