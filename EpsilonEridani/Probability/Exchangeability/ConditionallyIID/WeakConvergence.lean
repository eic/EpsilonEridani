# The empirical measures of a conditionally i.i.d. process converge weakly

The conditional strong law gives, for each *fixed* measurable set, almost-sure convergence of the
empirical frequencies of a conditionally i.i.d. process to the mass the directing measure gives
that set. This file makes the limit a statement about the empirical measures themselves: almost
surely, `empiricalMeasure (X · ω) n → ν ω` in the topology of convergence in distribution on
`ProbabilityMeasure α`.

Weak convergence tests against all bounded continuous functions at once, so the null set has to be
chosen before the test function is seen, and the fixed-set statement cannot simply be quantified
afterwards — outside a countable family of sets that interchange is false (see
`ConditionallyIID/StrongLaw.lean`). What makes the upgrade go through is that a second-countable
topology has a countable test class: the finite intersections of a countable basis, on which
`ConditionallyIIDWith.tendsto_empiricalMeasure_apply_ae_forall` provides a single null set, and
from which `IsPiSystem.tendsto_probabilityMeasure_of_tendsto_of_mem` recovers weak convergence —
they form a π-system containing arbitrarily small neighbourhoods of every point.

The hypotheses on the state space are topological, not standard Borel: a second-countable
topology whose open sets are measurable is all the argument uses. In particular a Polish space
with its Borel σ-algebra qualifies, which is the form in which the roadmap states the result.

## Main results

* `ConditionallyIIDWith.tendsto_empiricalMeasure_ae` — almost surely, the empirical measures
  converge weakly to the directing measure.

The de Finetti endpoint, where the directing measure of an *exchangeable* process has to be
produced first, is `deFinetti_empiricalMeasure` in `DeFinetti/EmpiricalMeasure.lean`.

/-- **The empirical measures of a conditionally i.i.d. process converge weakly to its directing
measure, almost surely.** The convergence is in the topology of convergence in distribution on
`ProbabilityMeasure α`, and the null set is one and the same for every test function.

This is the measure-valued form of `ConditionallyIIDWith.tendsto_empiricalMeasure_apply_ae`, which
gives the same limit one measurable set at a time. It does not follow by interchanging the
quantifiers there, since no null set serves every measurable set at once; second countability is
what makes countably many instances suffice, through
`ConditionallyIIDWith.tendsto_empiricalMeasure_apply_ae_forall`. -/
