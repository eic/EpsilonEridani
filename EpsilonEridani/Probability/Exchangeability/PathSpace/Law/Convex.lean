# The convex structure on exchangeable path laws

Exchangeable probability laws on `ℕ → α` are closed under convex combination
(`ExchangeableLaw.smul_add_smul`), so the subtype they form carries the convex structure of
`ProbabilityMeasure`. This file names that combination.

It is generic path-law API: nothing here mentions the de Finetti representation. Keeping it out of
`DeFinetti/Correspondence.lean` is what lets a client use the convex structure without depending on
the correspondence theory, even though the affinity of `deFinettiEquiv` is what it was built for.

## Main results

* `ExchangeableLaw.smul_add_smul` — the unbundled closure of exchangeability under nonnegative
  linear combination, the prerequisite for the bundling.
* `exchangeableLawConvexComb` — the combination, with `toMeasure_exchangeableLawConvexComb`
  exposing its underlying measure.
