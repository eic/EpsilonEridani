# Symmetry notions under a coordinatewise almost-everywhere change of process

Every symmetry predicate of Layer 0 is a statement about the finite-dimensional laws of `X`, or —
for `FullyExchangeable` — about its path law, so each sees the coordinates only modulo `μ`-a.e.
equality. This file records that: replacing each `X i` by a coordinatewise a.e. equal `Y i` changes
neither `blockLaw`, `prefixLaw` and `pathLaw` nor any of `ExchangeableAt`, `Exchangeable`,
`FullyExchangeable` and `Contractable`.

Changing a random variable on a null set is routine — most often to replace an a.e. measurable
coordinate by a measurable version — and without these lemmas a valid process becomes unusable at
the interfaces that demand exact measurability. The representation predicates get the same treatment
beside their own definitions, in `MixedIID/Congr.lean` and `ConditionallyIID/Congr.lean`.

## Main results

* `blockLaw_congr`, `prefixLaw_congr`, `pathLaw_congr` — the finite-dimensional and path laws are
  unchanged.
* `ExchangeableAt.congr`, `Exchangeable.congr`, `FullyExchangeable.congr`, `Contractable.congr` —
  the symmetry predicates transport.

## Implementation

Everything reduces to `Measure.map_congr`: a coordinate selection `Fin m → ι` is countable, so
`ae_all_iff` turns the coordinatewise hypotheses into a single a.e. statement about the tuple map,
and the same argument over `ℕ` handles the path map.
