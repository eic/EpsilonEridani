# Disintegrating a measure over a countable coordinate

A measure `σ` on a product `Y × Z` disintegrates over `Y` when it is the composition-product
`σ.fst ⊗ₘ κ` of its first marginal with a Markov kernel `κ : Kernel Y Z`. Mathlib supplies such a
kernel when the *second* factor `Z` is standard Borel
(`MeasureTheory.Measure.condKernel`). For a finite `σ`, this file supplies one in the complementary
regime: when the *first* factor `Y` is countable with measurable singletons, and `Z` is any
nonempty measurable space.

On a countable `Y` no analytic input is needed — the disintegration is the elementary formula
`κ y s = (σ.fst {y})⁻¹ * σ ({y} ×ˢ s)`, conditioning on the atom `{y}`. The one point that needs
care is the atoms of zero mass, where that formula reads `∞ * 0` and carries no information: they
are given a default value, and the disintegration still holds there because such an atom carries
no `σ`-mass to begin with (`measure_singleton_prod_eq_zero_of_fst_eq_zero`).

## Main definitions

* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.countableCondKernel` — the conditional kernel of a finite measure on
  `Y × Z` over a countable `Y`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.measure_singleton_prod_eq_zero_of_fst_eq_zero` — an atom of zero
  first-marginal
  mass carries no mass at all: the fact that makes the default value at such an atom harmless;
* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.countableCondKernel_apply`,
  `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.countableCondKernel_apply_of_ne_zero` and
  `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.countableCondKernel_apply_of_eq_zero` — the eliminator and the two
  branches of the construction, made explicit;
* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.compProd_countableCondKernel` — **the disintegration**,
  `σ.fst ⊗ₘ countableCondKernel σ = σ`, registered as a
  `MeasureTheory.Measure.IsCondKernel` instance;
* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.eq_countableCondKernel_of_ne_zero` — every conditional kernel of `σ`
  agrees with this one at every atom of positive mass;

The file also contains two private regression examples showing that the contract cannot be
strengthened and that its finiteness hypothesis cannot be dropped.

## Implementation notes

The kernel is built with `ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.ofFunOfCountable`, which upgrades an arbitrary
function on a countable space with measurable singletons to a kernel; the measurability of the
disintegration, the only nontrivial requirement in the standard Borel setting, is free here.

The value at an atom of zero mass is a Dirac measure at `Classical.arbitrary Z`, hence the
`[Nonempty Z]` hypothesis. Some choice is forced: a Markov kernel must return a probability
measure at every point of `Y`, `σ` prescribes none at a null atom, and on an empty `Z` no Markov
kernel exists at all, by `ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.eq_zero_of_isEmpty_right` together with
`ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.not_isMarkovKernel_zero`. The choice is deliberately *not* hidden —
`countableCondKernel_apply_of_eq_zero` names it. A private regression below exhibits two
conditional kernels of one measure that differ at a null atom, so no strengthening of
`eq_countableCondKernel_of_ne_zero` to all atoms is available.

finite, this is its conditional kernel over the first coordinate.

At an atom `y` of positive first-marginal mass this is the normalised slice
`s ↦ (σ.fst {y})⁻¹ * σ ({y} ×ˢ s)`; at a null atom, where `σ` prescribes nothing, it is a Dirac
measure. Unlike `MeasureTheory.Measure.condKernel`, this needs no standard-Borel or other
regularity hypothesis on the nonempty second factor `Z`. -/

section Regressions

/-! ### Regressions

Two examples that break the contract of `countableCondKernel` if it is read more strongly than it
is stated. The first shows the conclusion of `eq_countableCondKernel_of_ne_zero` cannot be
extended to null atoms; the second shows that `IsFiniteMeasure σ` cannot be dropped. (That
`Nonempty Z` cannot be dropped either is immediate from Mathlib:
`ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.eq_zero_of_isEmpty_right` and
`ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.not_isMarkovKernel_zero` leave no Markov kernel at all on an empty
target.) -/

/-- **Uniqueness genuinely fails at a null atom.** The Dirac measure at `(true, true)` on
`Bool × Bool` gives the atom `false` no mass, and the two kernels below both disintegrate it while
differing there. Thus a conditional kernel is always pinned down on atoms of positive mass, while
uniqueness can fail at null atoms; the default value `countableCondKernel` uses there is a choice,
not a derived quantity. -/
