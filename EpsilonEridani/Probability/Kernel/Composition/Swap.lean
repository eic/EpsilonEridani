# The composition-product of a measure and a kernel, in the reversed coordinate order

Mathlib's `μ ⊗ₘ κ` records the joint law of "draw `q` from `μ`, then `p` from `κ q`" as a measure
on `V × Ω`, the base coordinate first. `EpsilonEridani.swapCompProd μ κ` is that same joint law written
on `Ω × V`, the kernel coordinate first, which is the order some product semigroups come in.

Everything Mathlib proves about `⊗ₘ` transports across the swap, and this file records the
transported statements that are awkward to reconstruct at each use: the mass of a measurable
rectangle, the integral of a general function, the second marginal of a Markov composition, and
— for a nonempty standard Borel kernel target — the converse, that *every* finite measure on
`Ω × V` is such a composition over its second marginal.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.swapCompProd`: the measure `(μ ⊗ₘ κ).map Prod.swap` on `Ω × V`, with
  `EpsilonEridani.swapCompProd_prod` and `EpsilonEridani.lintegral_swapCompProd` evaluating it.
* `EpsilonEridani.exists_eq_swapCompProd`: every finite measure whose first coordinate is nonempty
  standard Borel is a `EpsilonEridani.swapCompProd` over its second marginal, by disintegration.
