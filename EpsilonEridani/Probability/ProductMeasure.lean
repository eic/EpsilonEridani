# Splitting off one coordinate of an infinite product measure

For a family of probability measures indexed by `Option ι`, the product measure
`Measure.infinitePi μ` is the law of an assignment `x` whose coordinates are independent with laws
`μ i`. Reading `x` as its value at `none` together with its restriction to the indices `some i`
separates it into two independent pieces, so

```text
(Measure.infinitePi μ).map (fun x => (x none, fun i => x (some i)))
  = μ none ⊗ Measure.infinitePi (fun i => μ (some i)).
```

This is the infinite-product analogue of Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.Measure.pi_map_piOptionEquivProd`,
which is stated for `Measure.pi` over a finite index type. It isolates one distinguished
coordinate — a global or initial variable — from the independent remaining coordinates, each
with its respective law.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.MeasureTheory.Measure.infinitePi_map_none_some` — the displayed identity.
