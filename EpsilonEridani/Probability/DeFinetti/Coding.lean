# The coding representation of an exchangeable sequence

De Finetti's theorem describes an exchangeable sequence by a *conditional law*: there is a random
probability measure `ν` such that, given `ν`, the coordinates are i.i.d. `ν`. This file converts
that description into a *functional* one. Writing `ϑ` for a sequence of independent uniform
variables on the unit interval, independent of `ν`, there is a single jointly measurable

```text
f : ProbabilityMeasure α → I → α
```

with

```text
(ν, X) =ᵈ (ν, (f ν ϑᵢ)ᵢ).
```

Thus, in distribution, an exchangeable sequence is a fixed measurable function of one random
parameter — its directing measure — and an independent i.i.d. uniform noise sequence, with all the
randomness of the sequence carried by the noise. This is the sequence case of the representations
in the Aldous–Hoover family, and the shape in which those representations are stated.

The function is `unitIntervalCoding α` of
`EpsilonEridani.Probability.Kernel.Randomization`, the same one for every process on `α`; only the law of
the parameter changes. The converse holds for an arbitrary jointly measurable `f`, without a
standard Borel hypothesis and for an arbitrary parameter space and arbitrary exchangeable noise
(`exchangeableLaw_map_prod_coding`), so the two together characterize exchangeability
(`exchangeableLaw_iff_exists_coding`).

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.map_prod_unitIntervalCoding_eq_deFinettiBarycenter` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.map_prod_unitIntervalCoding_eq_iidMixtureLaw` — coding a mixing law by
  uniform noise reproduces the de Finetti barycenter, and, keeping the parameter, the canonical
  conditionally i.i.d. law.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.ConditionallyIIDWith.jointPathLaw_eq_map_unitIntervalCoding` — the joint law
  of a directing measure and its process is the law of the coded pair.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.deFinetti_coding` — **the representation**: the joint law of an exchangeable
  process and its directing measure is the law of the coded parameter-noise pair.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.ExchangeableLaw.exists_eq_map_unitIntervalCoding` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.exchangeableLaw_iff_exists_coding` — the path-law forms, the second an
  equivalence.

## Implementation

Everything reduces to one identity about `Measure.prod`: a parameter drawn from `π` together with
independent i.i.d. noise, pushed through a map carrying the noise law to `P t`, has the canonical
law `iidMixtureLaw` (`map_prod_infinitePi_eq_iidMixtureLaw`). At the coding map this is
`map_volume_unitIntervalCoding`, and forgetting the parameter gives the barycenter. No new measure
theory is needed: the analytic content is Mathlib's
`ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.exists_measurable_map_eq_unitInterval` and the probabilistic content is
the already-proved de Finetti theorem.

This advances `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, Layer 8, "exchangeable arrays and the
Aldous–Hoover representation": a functional representation is the form those theorems take, and the
sequence case built here is the base of that tower. No material is adapted from
`cameronfreer/exchangeability`, which stops at the conditional-law form of de Finetti.
