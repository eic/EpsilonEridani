# The de Finetti measure is the mixing law

The development names the mixing law of an exchangeable process three times:

* `deFinettiMeasure μ X`, the law of the canonical tail directing measure
  (`DeFinetti/Mixture.lean`);
* the unique witness `π` produced by `deFinetti_mixture` (`DeFinetti/Representation.lean`);
* `deFinettiEquiv.symm ρ`, the mixing law read off an exchangeable path law
  (`DeFinetti/Correspondence.lean`).

This file proves they agree. The first is a construction on the sample space, the second an
existential characterization of the path law, and the third the inverse of a bijection; without
these identifications a caller holding one of them cannot use the theorems stated about the others.

## Main results

* `pathLaw_eq_bind_infinitePi_deFinettiMeasure_of_contractable` and
  `..._of_exchangeable` — the mixture representation directly from contractability or
  exchangeability, with no witness supplied by the caller.
* `eq_deFinettiMeasure_of_pathLaw_eq_bind_infinitePi` — *every* mixing law representing the path
  law is `deFinettiMeasure`; this is what identifies the `deFinetti_mixture` witness.
* `deFinettiEquiv_symm_eq_deFinettiMeasure` — the correspondence reads `deFinettiMeasure` off the
  packaged path law.

## Hypotheses

The witness that drives everything here is
`Contractable.conditionallyIIDWith_directingProbabilityMeasure`: a contractable process with
measurable coordinates, valued in a nonempty standard Borel state space, under a finite measure,
has `directingProbabilityMeasure μ X` as a directing measure. No standard-Borel hypothesis is
imposed on the sample space `Ω`, so neither is one imposed below; a probability base measure is
needed only because `deFinettiMeasure` is bundled as a `ProbabilityMeasure`.

`[Nonempty α]` cannot be dropped here even though a probability measure on `Ω` together with `X 0`
exhibits a point of `α`: it is not only a hypothesis. `deFinettiMeasure` is built from
`condDistrib`, so the instance is needed to *elaborate the statements themselves*, not just to
prove them.

The coordinates must be exactly measurable for a concrete reason that is not about
`deFinettiMeasure` itself — that elaborates for an arbitrary `X`:
`Contractable.conditionallyIIDWith_directingProbabilityMeasure`, which supplies the witness,
asks for `∀ n, Measurable (X n)`.

## Why the `L²` route supplies the witness

The theorems below carry no route suffix, yet the witness comes from the `L²` route. That is not a
route claim: `deFinettiMeasure` is the law of `directingProbabilityMeasure μ X`, and the `L²`
route's conditional summit is the one that names *that* object. The martingale route reaches the
conditional summit through `conditionallyIIDWith_of_contractable_pathSpace`, whose witness lives on
path space, and its mixture-side `mixedIIDWith_of_contractable` names the canonical directing
measure only under `[StandardBorelSpace Ω]`. Taking the witness from the `L²` route is therefore
what keeps that hypothesis out of these statements; a martingale-route proof would give a strictly
weaker theorem, not a differently-named one.

/-- **The de Finetti measure is the unique mixing law.** Any probability measure on
`ProbabilityMeasure α` representing the path law of an exchangeable process as an infinite-product
mixture is `deFinettiMeasure`.

In particular the witness returned by `deFinetti_mixture` is this one, so a concrete mixing law
established by any other route can be compared with the canonical construction.

Exchangeability is not assumed: `hπ` already exhibits the path law as a de Finetti barycenter, and
every barycenter of a mixing probability law is an exchangeable path law. -/

/-- **The correspondence recovers the de Finetti measure.** Reading the mixing law off the path law
of an exchangeable process, through the inverse of `deFinettiEquiv`, gives the canonical
`deFinettiMeasure`.

The packaged exchangeable law is taken as a hypothesis rather than constructed, so the caller may
supply whichever bundling of `pathLaw μ X` is at hand. Exchangeability of the process is not
assumed separately: `ρ.2` and `hρ` already say the path law is exchangeable. -/
