# The de Finetti correspondence

De Finetti's theorem says that the barycenter map `π ↦ ∫ P^{⊗ℕ} dπ(P)` is a bijection from mixing
laws onto exchangeable path laws. This file packages that bijection as an equivalence

```text
deFinettiEquiv :
  ProbabilityMeasure (ProbabilityMeasure α) ≃ {ρ : ProbabilityMeasure (ℕ → α) // ExchangeableLaw ρ}
```

for a standard Borel state space `α`, and identifies its point masses.

Injectivity is `Measure.ext_of_bind_infinitePi_eq`, surjectivity is
`ExchangeableLaw.existsUnique_mixingLaw` — de Finetti's theorem in path-law form. The inverse
`deFinettiEquiv.symm` is therefore a genuine construction: it reads the mixing law off an
exchangeable law.

The correspondence is affine, `deFinettiBarycenter_add` and `deFinettiBarycenter_smul` giving
the mixture identity on the barycenter side and `deFinettiEquiv_convexComb` /
`deFinettiEquiv_symm_convexComb` stating it for the bundled objects on both sides of the
equivalence; and it takes the point masses of
`ProbabilityMeasure α` exactly to the extreme exchangeable laws
(`deFinettiBarycenter_mem_extremePoints_iff`, `deFinettiEquiv_dirac`). Reading
`deFinettiBarycenter` as `deFinettiBarycenter_eq_join_map` does, this is the canonical
decomposition of an exchangeable law over the extreme — equivalently the
i.i.d. — exchangeable laws: the mixing law is unique, and the path laws it averages are extreme.

This settles the Layer 8 bullet "the affine and ergodic decomposition of exchangeable laws" in
`EpsilonEridaniRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`. Together with `exchangeableSigma_trivial_iff_iid`,
`exchangeableSigma_trivial_iff_ergodicSMul` and `exchangeable_extreme_iff_iid`, this correspondence
identifies the product — equivalently extreme — components with the ergodic components for the
finitely supported permutation action, which that bullet sequences after the `ErgodicSMul` interface
of Layer 6. Those equivalences compose directly; no additional correspondence declaration is
required.

⚠ The action is the finitely supported permutations of the *time index*. Ergodicity for it is a
different statement from ergodicity of the one-sided shift, which concerns the smaller σ-algebra of
shift-invariant events; see `PathSpace/Exchangeable/Ergodic.lean`.

## Main results

* `deFinettiEquiv` — mixing laws correspond bijectively to exchangeable path laws.
* `deFinettiEquiv_dirac`, `deFinettiEquiv_symm_eq_dirac` — a point mass corresponds to an
  i.i.d. law, in both directions.
* `deFinettiEquiv_convexComb`, `deFinettiEquiv_symm_convexComb` — the correspondence and its
  inverse are affine, stated at the bundled level with `ProbabilityMeasure.convexComb` and
  `exchangeableLawConvexComb`.
* `deFinettiBarycenter_mem_extremePoints_iff` — a barycenter is an extreme exchangeable law
  exactly when its mixing law is a point mass.

/-- **The de Finetti correspondence.** Over a standard Borel state space, the de Finetti
barycenter is a bijection from mixing laws — probability measures on `ProbabilityMeasure α` — onto
exchangeable probability measures on `ℕ → α`.

The forward map is `deFinettiBarycenter`; the inverse sends an exchangeable law to its mixing law.
Injectivity is uniqueness of the mixing law and surjectivity is de Finetti's theorem, so the
equivalence is exactly the content of `ExchangeableLaw.existsUnique_mixingLaw` in bijective
form. -/

/-! ### Affinity

The correspondence is affine, and this section says so at the bundled level, with no coercion to
`Measure` on either side of the equations.

There is no `AffineMap` or `AffineEquiv` to be had: `ProbabilityMeasure` is not a module over
anything, carrying neither addition nor a scalar action, only the convex structure inherited from
the ambient `Measure` cone. `ProbabilityMeasure.convexComb` names that convex structure, and
`exchangeableLawConvexComb` carries it to the subtype of exchangeable laws; both are generic, so
they live outside this module. Affinity is then two equations between bundled objects.

Weights are arbitrary elements of `ℝ≥0∞` summing to `1`. Normalization is not decorative: without
it the combination is not a probability measure, so neither side of either equation would typecheck.
The unbundled statements without it are `deFinettiBarycenter_add` and `deFinettiBarycenter_smul`. -/

/-- **The correspondence is affine.** It carries the convex combination of two mixing laws to the
convex combination, with the same weights, of their exchangeable path laws. -/

    (π₁ π₂ : ProbabilityMeasure (ProbabilityMeasure α)) :

      ProbabilityMeasure.toMeasure_convexComb, deFinettiBarycenter_add,
      deFinettiBarycenter_smul]))

/-- **The inverse correspondence is affine**: decomposing an exchangeable law as a convex
combination decomposes its mixing law the same way.

Formally this is the previous theorem read through the bijection, but the bijection is where
de Finetti's theorem sits: surjectivity of `deFinettiEquiv` is the representation theorem, and
injectivity is uniqueness of the mixing law. -/

    (ρ₁ ρ₂ : {ρ : ProbabilityMeasure (ℕ → α) // ExchangeableLaw (ρ : Measure (ℕ → α))}) :

  rw [Equiv.symm_apply_eq, deFinettiEquiv_convexComb, Equiv.apply_symm_apply,
    Equiv.apply_symm_apply]

/-- **The extreme fibres of the correspondence are exactly the point masses.** The de Finetti
barycenter of a mixing law is an extreme exchangeable probability law if and only if that mixing
law is a Dirac mass.

Combined with `deFinettiBarycenter_eq_join_map`, this is the canonical decomposition an
exchangeable law admits: it is the barycenter of a unique law on path laws, and that law is
carried by the extreme — equivalently i.i.d. — exchangeable laws
(`infinitePi_mem_extremePoints_exchangeable`), degenerating exactly on the extreme points
themselves. -/
