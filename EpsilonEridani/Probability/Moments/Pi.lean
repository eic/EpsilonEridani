# Moment-generating functions of sums of coordinates under a product measure

A statistic of the form `x ↦ ∑ j, f j (x j)` under a finite product measure `Measure.pi μ` has
exponential `∏ j, exp (t * f j (x j))`, so Fubini's theorem turns its moment-generating function
into the product of the coordinate ones. For a product of *probability* measures each factor is
positive exactly on its exponential-integrability domain, so the domain of the sum is then the
intersection of the domains of the coordinates. That step genuinely needs the coordinates to be
probability measures: under the zero measure, for instance, the moment-generating function
vanishes everywhere while the integrability domain is all of `ℝ`.

These are the facts that turn a quadratic statistic of a Gaussian vector, written in
eigen-coordinates, into a product of one-dimensional moment-generating functions.

The variance of a sum of coordinates is simpler still: the coordinates are independent, so their
variances add (`ProbabilityTheory.variance_sum_pi`). For the average of `n` independent copies of
one square integrable statistic this gives variance `Var[f] / n`, and Chebyshev's inequality turns
that into the **weak law of large numbers** with an explicit rate: the average deviates from the
mean by at least `t` with probability at most `Var[f] / (n t²)`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.mgf_sum_pi` — the moment-generating function of a sum of coordinate
  statistics factors over the coordinates, for every argument;
* `EpsilonEridani.integrableExpSet_sum_pi` — for a product of probability measures, its
  exponential-integrability domain is the intersection of the coordinate domains;
* `EpsilonEridani.meas_ge_le_variance_div_card_mul_sq_pi` — the weak law of large numbers in Chebyshev's
  form, for the average of independent copies of a square-integrable statistic.
