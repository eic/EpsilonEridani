# Exponential moments of a statistic that is bounded below

Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.integrable_exp_mul_of_le` makes `exp (t * X)` integrable against a
finite measure when `X` is bounded above and the rate `t` is nonnegative. A law carried by a
half-line `[b, ∞)` needs the mirror image: `X` bounded below and `t` nonpositive. Both bounds are
one-sided, so neither statement follows from the two-sided
`ProbabilityTheory.integrable_exp_mul_of_mem_Icc`.

For such a law the remaining question is which positive rates survive, and that is decided by the
tail: if `X` already has an infinite moment of some order, then no positive rate is integrable
either, because an exponential moment on both sides of the origin forces every moment to be
finite. Combining the two statements gives the exponential-moment domain of a heavy-tailed
half-line law, which is `Set.Iic 0`.

## Main results

* `EpsilonEridani.integrable_exp_mul_of_ge` — every nonpositive rate is integrable when `X` is bounded
  below;
* `EpsilonEridani.not_integrable_exp_mul_of_not_integrable_rpow` and
  `EpsilonEridani.not_integrable_exp_mul_of_not_integrable_pow` — no positive rate is integrable once a
  real, respectively natural, moment of `X` fails to exist.

/-- **A nonpositive exponential rate is integrable when the statistic is bounded below.** On
`b ≤ X` the integrand `exp (t * X)` is at most `exp (t * b)` for `t ≤ 0`, which a finite measure
integrates. This is the mirror image of `ProbabilityTheory.integrable_exp_mul_of_le`, which bounds
`X` above and asks for a nonnegative rate. -/

moment.** The nonpositive rates cost nothing here, so a positive rate would give exponential
integrability on both sides of the origin, and that makes every moment finite. -/
