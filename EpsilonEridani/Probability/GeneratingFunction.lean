# Probability-generating functions

This file defines the probability-generating function of a natural-number-valued random variable
and establishes its basic measure-theoretic API.  The central results relate it to Mathlib's
moment-generating function and show that it turns sums of independent random variables into
products.  The file then identifies the generating function of a finite measure on `ℕ` with the
sum of the power series carrying its singleton masses, so that the generating function is analytic
on `(-1, 1)` and its Taylor coefficients at the origin recover those masses;
consequently a law on `ℕ` is determined by its generating function near `0`.

## Main declarations

* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.pgf` — the probability-generating function.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.pgf_exp` — evaluation at `exp t` is a moment-generating function, and
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.mgf_id_map_natCast` restates this for the real cast of a law on `ℕ`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.integrable_pow_of_abs_le_one` — on `[-1, 1]` the integrand is
  integrable under a finite measure.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.IndepFun.pgf_add` and `EpsilonEridani.Probability.iIndepFun.pgf_sum` —
  multiplicativity over binary and finite sums of independent random variables when the factor
  integrands are integrable.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.IndepFun.pgf_add_of_abs_le_one` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.iIndepFun.pgf_sum_of_abs_le_one` — the corresponding formulas on the
  interval `[-1, 1]`, where integrability is automatic.
* `Measure.pgf_conv` and `Measure.pgf_conv_of_abs_le_one` — convolution becomes
  multiplication under the natural integrability hypotheses, and for finite measures on
  `[-1, 1]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.hasSum_pgf` and `EpsilonEridani.Probability.pgf_eq_tsum` — the power-series
  expansion in the singleton masses, valid on `[-1, 1]`.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.hasFPowerSeriesOnBall_pgf` and `EpsilonEridani.Probability.analyticOnNhd_pgf` —
  analyticity on the open unit ball.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.iteratedDeriv_pgf_zero` — the Taylor coefficients at the origin are the
  singleton masses, with `EpsilonEridani.Probability.pgf_zero` and `EpsilonEridani.Probability.deriv_pgf_zero`
  reading off the first two.
* `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measure_eq_of_pgf_eventuallyEq` and
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.identDistrib_of_pgf_eventuallyEq` — uniqueness of the law from the germ of
  the generating function at `0`, with the corollaries
  `EpsilonEridani.Probability.measure_eq_of_pgf_eqOn` and `EpsilonEridani.Probability.identDistrib_of_pgf_eqOn`
  reading the hypothesis off `(-1, 1)`.

/-! ### Coefficient recovery and uniqueness

A finite measure on `ℕ` is the weighted sum of Dirac masses `∑ ν {n} • δ n`, so its
generating function is the sum of the power series `∑ ν.real {n} * t ^ n`.  The masses are
bounded by the total mass, so that series converges on the whole open unit ball and the generating
function is analytic there.  Reading its Taylor coefficients at the origin returns the masses, and
hence a finite measure on `ℕ`, in particular a probability measure, is determined by its generating
function near `0`. -/
