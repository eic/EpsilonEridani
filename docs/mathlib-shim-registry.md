# Mathlib shim registry

`EpsilonEridani/mathlib-shims.json` records Tau Ceti source that is temporary pending an upstream
Mathlib replacement. It is AI-owned data: a source-only migration PR may update the registry in
the same commit as the Lean files it changes. The checker itself and its CI wiring under
`scripts/` and `.github/` remain human-owned.

Each JSON object has these fields:

- `sources` (required): unique repository-relative `EpsilonEridani/*.lean` paths sharing the same
  upstream triggers.
- `declarations`: fully qualified Lean declaration names to look up in pinned Mathlib.
- `modules`: fully qualified `Mathlib.*` module names to look up in the pinned Mathlib source
  tree. At least one declaration or module is required.
- `note`: durable migration context and attribution. For vendored or ported material, retain the
  upstream project or PR, author, and URL here even if temporary process prose is later removed
  from a module docstring.
- `speculative` (optional, default `false`): the target name or path is only a guess. A match asks
  for an audit but cannot identify a deterministic migration.
- `landing_sentinel` (optional, default `false`): the target signals that an upstream body of work
  landed, but does not claim every declaration in the listed sources has an exact counterpart.

An entry with neither `speculative` nor `landing_sentinel` is exact. Under
`--fail-on-available`, any matching exact declaration or module exits 3 and makes the required
`build` status red. The active Bump or Fix-CI worker must migrate the superseded surface, preserve
or re-home source-only API, update the registry, and return that PR to green. Speculative and
landing-sentinel matches are warnings only.

The registry deliberately does not copy each file's declaration list. When checking a PR, CI
loads the registry and source files from that PR's merge base, derives their command-level Lean
declarations, and ratchets inherited probes while that surface remains. Deleting a fully migrated
source discharges the obligation. Moving declarations is also allowed when the new registered
source preserves the inherited probes. Merely deleting probes, or changing an exact entry into an
audit-only sentinel while its inherited surface remains, is rejected.

The prose scan is one-way. A source that calls itself a temporary Mathlib shim, or says its
surface should be deleted or refactored onto future upstream API, must be registered. Removing
that process narrative does not remove an existing registry obligation. Keep the entry and its
note synchronized with the source's actual upstream relationship; attribution in either location
is not disposable process prose.

## Exit codes

- `0`: registry and environment are valid; no blocking exact replacement was found.
- `2`: malformed metadata, a weakened inherited obligation, or an unavailable inspection
  environment.
- `3`: `--fail-on-available` found at least one exact replacement.

The default command is report-only. Mathlib bump PRs probe the full registry in strict mode.
Ordinary feature PRs compare with their merge-base registry and probe only entries they add or
change, so old shim backlog cannot make an unrelated feature PR red.
