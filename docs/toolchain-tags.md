# Toolchain tags

Tau Ceti tags eligible Lean releases as `vX`, the way Mathlib does, so a project on Lean
v4.34.0 can check out `v4.34.0` here and get a tree that builds.

## The rule

**`vX` is the first commit on `main` whose `lean-toolchain` is `leanprover/lean4:X`.**

Mathlib puts its `vX` tag on the commit that bumps its own `lean-toolchain` to X, and
`scripts/check-bump.sh` requires this repository's toolchain to match Mathlib's at whatever
it pins. The first `main` commit on toolchain X therefore pins Mathlib at or after Mathlib's
`vX` tag. The tag message gives the pin.

Exact Mathlib pins were tried and dropped: they need release commits constructed on their
own branches, built from source, and their caches published.

## What a tag promises

The commit is on that Lean toolchain, its post-merge CI passed, and its oleans are in the
Lake artifact cache, so a checkout builds without recompiling the library. The tool checks
the recorded CI result and the published cache; neither needs a rebuild.

## What it does not cover

The tool tags only commits on `main`. A release mathlib has tagged but `main` has not
reached yet is reported `ahead`: nothing is wrong, the bump has not got there, and it will
be tagged like any other release when it does. A release `main` went past without stopping
is reported `unreachable`. Two things cause that, and they differ in what can be done about them: the
daily bump stepped over the release's window on Mathlib master, which a later bump could
avoid, or Mathlib cut the release on its `stable` branch and no bump moved to that tag.
`check-bump.sh` accepts a `v4.*` release tag on a newer toolchain, so a bump reaches a stable
patch release when a dependency pins it; otherwise `main` goes past it, and it can only be
tagged by hand.

Such a release can still be tagged by hand off a `main` commit. `v4.33.0` is one: a commit
off `afb1aacb` changing only the two pin files, built from source, with its cache uploaded
manually. The report marks it `tagged`, notes that it was constructed, and says whether it
found a cache. `--create` does not construct these; the procedure is in the module docstring
of `scripts/toolchain_tags.py`.

Releases older than `v4.33.0-rc1` are out of scope, because the Lake cache has no older
entries. That bound is `EARLIEST_RELEASE` in the script; raise it if the cache is pruned,
never lower it.

## Reporting

`.github/workflows/toolchain-tags.yml` posts to Zulip (Tau Ceti > "Toolchain tags") when a
release becomes taggable or turns out not to be taggable. It runs on a push to `main` that
changes `lean-toolchain`, waits for `ci.yml` to conclude on that commit, and then posts only
if the state has changed since its last message. It reads that state from a marker in the
message, so it stores nothing, and it never creates a tag. Before comparing that marker,
the bot repairs the missing `shell` language on its own newest old-style command fence;
that one-time edit leaves the report body unchanged.

The wait matters: the push lands 40 to 70 minutes before the release is taggable, because
`ci.yml` coalesces bursts of `main` pushes and then takes 20 to 30 minutes, publishing the
Lake cache at the end. Reporting at push time would always say "not yet".

A release waiting on CI shows as `pending` and is left out of the change comparison. It is
not news, and including it would post one message saying "wait" and another when the
waiting ended.

## Using it

```
python3 scripts/toolchain_tags.py                      # the report
python3 scripts/toolchain_tags.py --create v4.34.0     # one tag
python3 scripts/toolchain_tags.py --create --all       # every ready release
```

Run `--create` after a bump lands on a new toolchain. It needs a `gh` login with write
access; the report needs only read.

If a tag does not match the rule, the tool reports it and changes nothing.
