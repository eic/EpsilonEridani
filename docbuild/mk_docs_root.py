"""Generate docbuild/EpsilonEridaniDocs.lean, a root module that imports every EpsilonEridani module.

doc-gen4's library `docs` facet documents a library's *root* modules and their import
closure. EpsilonEridani's own root (`EpsilonEridani.lean`) is intentionally empty and imports nothing —
the library is assembled from the `EpsilonEridani.*` glob, not from a re-exporting root — so
pointing doc-gen at it documents nothing. This script writes an aggregator root that
`public import`s all 500-plus modules, so its closure is the whole library (and, in turn,
the Mathlib declarations it depends on). Run it before `lake build EpsilonEridaniDocs:docs`.

The output is a build artifact, not source: it is git-ignored and regenerated (in CI and
locally) so it can never drift from the module tree.
