# and its punctuation live here, in a file the shell reads as a script rather than as a

# single-quoted argument early and reddened every PR build; see #694.)

# `--fail-level=info`, so the build fails if any module logs an `info:` (or warning/error) — a stray
# #check/#eval, a `simp?`/`ring_nf?`-style "Try this: …" suggestion, a linter note. A clean elaboration
# logs nothing above trace, so this is exit-code enforcement, not output scraping.
