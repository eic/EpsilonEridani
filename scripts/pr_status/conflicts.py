"""Label a PR that has stopped merging into its base branch, and say so once.

A PR becomes conflicted because the BASE moved, not because its author did
anything, which makes it the one transition nothing else here can see. Every other
trigger in this repository is scoped to the PR -- `pull_request_target`, a
`pr-build` / `Review` `workflow_run`, an `issue_comment` -- and the base moving
fires none of them. So a PR could pick up a conflict and nothing anywhere said so:
`stuck_alerts.py` deliberately skips a conflicting PR (it is not being wrongly
withheld by the merge path) and `housekeeping.py` only retires PRs that are
blocking under review, so a conflicted-but-approved PR was reaped by nothing
either. It rotted silently.

The `merge-conflict` label is deliberately NOT part of the mutually-exclusive set
`labels.py` maintains, and nothing else reads or writes it. Conflict is orthogonal
to where a PR sits in the pipeline: a PR can be awaiting review AND conflicting,
and saying both is more useful than having one hide the other. Keeping them apart
also means conflict state never enters `core.derive` and can never lose a
precedence argument against CI or review state.

THE LABEL IS THE STATE. Whether an episode is open is just "is the label on the
PR", so there is no marker to parse and no way to fail to recognise our own
bookkeeping; a wrong label self-heals on the next run. It also makes the problem
measurable without anything extra, because GitHub timestamps label changes:
`labeled merge-conflict` -> `unlabeled merge-conflict` in the PR timeline is the
observed episode, recorded by GitHub rather than self-reported.

Two ordering decisions carry the weight, and both are deliberate:

  * **The comment is posted BEFORE the label.** The label is what suppresses a
    repeat, so adding it first means a comment that then fails is never retried --
    the notice is lost silently, which is the one failure this module cannot have.
    Commenting first fails the other way: a label write that fails after a
    successful comment costs a duplicate comment next run. A duplicate is
    annoying; a lost notification defeats the purpose.
  * **UNKNOWN is skipped per PR, never per run.** GitHub computes `mergeable`
    lazily, so a read taken just after the base moved answers UNKNOWN and only
    schedules the merge. Those PRs are re-read a few times; any that stay unknown
    are LEFT EXACTLY AS THEY ARE -- not labelled, not cleared -- while every PR
    whose state we do know is still processed. A PR whose head has diverged from
    its branch tip can sit at `mergeable: null` indefinitely (that is what
    `stuck_alerts.py`'s `diverged-head` detector is for), and one such PR must not
    be able to stop the others being labelled.

A PR carrying a hold label is left entirely alone, not labelled-but-silent. The
label means "the author has been told", and labelling without commenting would
break that: once the hold came off, the label would already claim the conflict was
handled and it would stay silent for good.

Only OPEN PRs are read, so a PR closed while labelled keeps the label. That is
accurate -- it was conflicting when it closed -- but it means a timeline has no
closing event for that episode, which anyone measuring should allow for.

Usage:
    conflicts.py sweep [--dry-run]

Environment:
    GH_REPO                   default "eic/EpsilonEridani"
    GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN   used by `gh` (needs issues:write)

Only python3's standard library and an authenticated `gh` CLI are required.
