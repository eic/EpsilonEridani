# check-bump.sh — validate that a PR's proposed Lake-pin / toolchain change is a
# safe, machine-checkable *forward* bump, and nothing else.
#
# This is the trust anchor that lets a PR touching `lake-manifest.json` and/or
# `lean-toolchain` be built and auto-merged without a human.
# the worry is a PR that re-points a dependency at a malicious fork/commit or a
# malicious toolchain and then gets auto-built. We reduce the whole manifest to a
# deterministic function of one validated fact — "mathlib moved forward on the
# branch nominated in lakefile.toml" — and require the toolchain to move forward
# and match mathlib's:
#
#   1. lakefile.toml / lakefile.lean are byte-identical to base.
#   2. The nominated require (mathlib) is the ONLY package named "mathlib", is a
#      `git` package pinned to a 40-hex commit SHA, keeps its url, and normally keeps
#      inputRev at `master`.
#      Its new rev is a *descendant of the old rev* AND *on the trusted base
#      inputRev's history* — a genuine forward move on the nominated branch (via
#      the GitHub compare API; the SHA requirement makes the compared revs
#      immutable, so what we validate is exactly what Lake will resolve and build).
#      Its new rev is also one whose master-push build completed, so its oleans are in the
#      cache (see step 2b).
#   3. The PR manifest's package set, MINUS mathlib, is EXACTLY mathlib's own
#      lake-manifest at the new rev, comparing WHOLE entries (only `inherited` may differ,
#      and must be true) — no package added, removed, renamed, retyped (e.g. a `path`
#      dep), duplicated, re-pointed, or re-configured (`subDir`, `configFile`,
#      `manifestFile`, `scope`) independently of the trusted mathlib. The mathlib entry
#      differs from base only in `rev`, and every top-level field (`packagesDir`,
#      `lakeDir`, ...) equals base. See scripts/bump_manifest.py.
#   4. lean-toolchain moves monotonically forward on the leanprover/lean4 channel
#      AND equals mathlib's lean-toolchain at the new rev.
#
# It does NO build and runs NONE of the PR's code — only reads/parses two text
# files and queries the trusted upstream via `gh api`. Usage:
#
#   check-bump.sh <base_dir> <merge_base_dir> <pr_dir>
#
# where each dir holds the repo's lean-toolchain, lake-manifest.json, lakefile.toml
# (and optionally lakefile.lean). base_dir is the CURRENT target-branch tip — the
# trusted forward-progress policy anchor a genuine bump is validated against. The exact-head
# build uses the candidate config after separately attesting its lakefile to the merge base.
# merge_base_dir is the PR's merge-base with the target branch, used
# only to decide whether the PR changed these files at all (so a PR that is merely
# behind the tip is not judged as if it had edited them). Exit 0 = safe forward bump
# (or no pin change); exit 1 = not auto-mergeable (route to a human). Reasons printed.

  # --- 2b. the new rev is one whose cache was actually published ---------------
  # Being on master is not enough. Mathlib lands in batches: bors tests a batch and
  # fast-forwards master over all of its commits, but only the resulting master tip is
  # built by the push-triggered CI run, and that run is the only one that publishes to
  # the `mathlib4-master` cache container (mathlib's build.yml gates `publish_cache` on
  # `event_name == 'push' && ref == 'refs/heads/master'`). A batch's intermediate commits
  # are ordinary ancestors whose oleans were never uploaded, so pinning to one costs every
  # downstream build a full recompile of whatever that commit invalidated: a rename in a
  # core algebra file is ~1400 modules and about an hour, on every CI run and every
  # pr-build, until the pin moves again.
  #
  # We require that publishing run to have COMPLETED successfully on this exact rev. That
  # is both narrower and better timed than asking bors: bors reports success on the batch
  # commit before the master build has uploaded anything, so a very fresh tip can carry a
  # green bors status while its cache is still hours away. Coupling to upstream's workflow
  # file name is deliberate. If it is renamed this check fails closed and the bump routes
  # to a human, which is the safe direction for a trust anchor.
  # The question itself lives in mathlib_cache.py, which resolve_deps.py asks too: the resolver must
  # not propose a rev this step would refuse.
