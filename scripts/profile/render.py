"""Render the proof-profile PR comment from countHeartbeats measurement logs.

Called by .github/workflows/pr-profile.yml, in the trusted step that runs
*after* the sandboxed measurement finishes. Inputs are environment variables
and the per-file `.hb` logs the sandbox wrote under $PREP/src; the output is
the Markdown comment body written to $OUTPUT.

The metric is heartbeats, from Mathlib's `linter.countHeartbeats` (reported in
`maxHeartbeats` units), summed over a file's declarations. Heartbeats are
deterministic and machine-independent, so they are the signal we compare and
flag on; wall time is not measured here.

New (added) files get an absolute per-file count. Modified files get a
base -> head comparison: a file is flagged as a build-cost regression when its
head cost is at least FLAG_RATIO times its base cost, provided the absolute
rise clears FLAG_MIN_ABS_HB (so a tiny file cannot flag on a few heartbeats).
The default ratio is 1.5, i.e. a refactor may not make a file half again as
expensive to elaborate. The comment is advisory and never fails the build.

A modified file's base and head sources are both elaborated against the same
built (head) environment. That is sound when a change is local to the file's
own proofs and definition bodies; a base source that no longer elaborates
there (typically because a statement it depends on changed) is reported and
left out of the comparison rather than mismeasured.
