"""Where is the pull-request pipeline slow right now, and why?

Merge throughput is one number at the end of a queue, so a fall in it says
something is wrong without saying what. This measures each stage separately:
how fast pull requests arrive at it, how fast they leave, how deep it currently
is, and how long they sit in it, each against a trailing baseline.

Historical rates describe lifecycle-label transitions. Current depths are checked
against the pinned merge gate; label disagreements and unknown reads are explicit.
Queue membership and reservations are reported separately. The stages include:

  awaiting-CI          waiting for a build on the latest commit
  awaiting-review      green, waiting for a reviewer
  review-in-progress   a review is running on this commit
  ci-failed            build failed; the author has to act
  awaiting-author      changes requested; the author has to act
  ready-to-merge       all per-PR merge prerequisites pass
  needs-human-review   approved changes require human review
  awaiting-dependency  waiting for a stacked base
  on-hold              a draft or explicit hold

Two of those are not the project's to fix. `ci-failed` and `awaiting-author`
sit with the contributor, and reading a backlog there as a project problem
would point effort at exactly the wrong place, so they are reported separately
from the stages the project owns.

Historical data comes from the statistics snapshot. Live reports also audit open
PRs and read the queue once; --data replays the stored evidence offline:

    scripts/pipeline_health.py                       # fetch and report
    scripts/pipeline_health.py --json                # machine-readable
    scripts/pr_stats_graphs.py --dump-data snap.json --out-dir /tmp/x
    scripts/pipeline_health.py --data snap.json      # replay, no network

    A spell still running is not a missing observation: it is the knowledge that
    this one has already lasted at least this long. Dropping those makes a
    filling stage look fast, because the spells still running are exactly the
    slow ones -- `awaiting-review` reported a median dwell below its own
    baseline while eighty-nine pull requests sat in it for a median of five
    hours. Counting elapsed time as if it were final understates too, for the
    opposite reason: at any instant most occupants are young. Neither naive
    choice is available, so censor properly instead.

    Every observation is taken to be watched from age zero, so the caller must
    pass an inception cohort: spells selected by when they began, censored at
    the end of the period. Spells picked out by where they *ended* would include
    some already under way when the period opened, and those are at risk only
    from the age they had then; there is no delayed entry here to express that.

    None when the estimator never falls to half, which is the honest answer for
    a stage in which most spells are still running.

    The median is the first duration at which survival is a half *or below*,
    after Klein and Moeschberger. `lifelines` takes the first strictly below,
    so the two differ by one event time on the cohorts where survival lands on
    a half exactly -- about one sample in eighty of a random check against it,
    and none for any other reason. This convention is the one that makes "the
    median has reached t" and "survival is above a half just before t" the same

# badly: it was set when the busiest stage ran at a few pull requests an hour, and at forty an
# hour it started firing on rounding. The published report for 2026-09-22 called awaiting-review
# an anomaly for "arriving at 40.33/h and leaving at 40.25/h" -- a gap of 0.08/h, two pull
# requests either way across a twenty-four hour window, on a stage whose depth was ten. Nothing
# was wrong with it.
#
# So a stage must clear BOTH: the absolute floor, which keeps a quiet stage from being flagged on
# a fraction of a pull request a day, and the fraction, which keeps a busy one from being flagged
# on noise. The fraction is what does the work now -- at forty an hour it asks for two an hour,
# roughly fifty pull requests a day that arrived and did not leave -- and the floor still governs
# every stage quieter than one an hour, which is what it was chosen for.

#
# A fraction of arrivals cannot be the whole test. It is equivalent to demanding that departures
# fall below 95% of arrivals, so any smaller persistent loss is invisible for ever rather than
# merely needing more evidence: a stage taking forty an hour and clearing thirty-nine gains
# twenty-four pull requests a day, and stays under a 5%-of-forty margin at every window length.
# The stall test does not catch it either -- if 97.5% of spells still finish quickly, both the
# median dwell and the survival at twice it stay healthy while the queue grows all week.
#
# Drain time separates the two cases the fraction could not. The 2026-09-22 false positive was
