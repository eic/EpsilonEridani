# lake-cache-get.sh — restore EpsilonEridani's OWN root-package oleans from the public Lake
# artifact cache, factored out of .github/workflows/pr-build.yml so ci.yml can use the
# same logic. Both callers want identical final semantics: a clean whole cache, or none at all.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/lake-cache-get.sh <project-dir>
#
# Reads PUBLIC_ARTIFACT_ENDPOINT / PUBLIC_REVISION_ENDPOINT from the environment (the
# LAKE_CACHE_*_PUBLIC repo variables), defaulting to the public cache both this project's CI and
# its contributors read. The defaults exist so a contributor can run this from a checkout with no
# setup: the endpoints are public, anonymous and not secret. CI still passes them explicitly, and
# reaches this script only when those repo variables are set, so the defaults never decide what CI
# does. Expects LAKE_CACHE_DIR to be <project-dir>/.lake/cache.
# On an unclean outcome it discards the cache and appends the LAKE_* disable lines to
# $GITHUB_ENV, so the caller's build proceeds exactly as if the cache were switched off.
#
# Anonymous GETs from the PUBLIC read host (a different host than the S3 API endpoint the
# trusted upload uses). Looks up the root-package oleans for the checkout's revision --
# backtracking up to LAKE_CACHE_MAX_REVS revisions from HEAD (default 100; 0 means the complete
# available history), and unpacks them into $LAKE_CACHE_DIR. This is trusted, publisher-built
# data: no token is in reach and no PR code runs (the caller attests the declarative lakefile
# first). Mathlib's oleans are NOT here; they come from `lake exe cache get`.
#
# Callers choose the limit, because only they know whether a walk can pay. The search stops as
# soon as a lookup succeeds, so where a hit is likely it reads only the few revisions between
# HEAD and a published one. Size it generously otherwise: overrunning the limit is reported as
# a total miss, and a total miss costs a full recompile, far dearer than the extra requests a
# longer walk would have made. `1` asks about HEAD alone and never walks.
#
# A TOTAL miss is non-fatal: the build just recompiles from scratch, as when the cache is off.
# A PARTIAL fetch is non-fatal too, but must not reach the offline build. Since v4.34.0-rc1,
# Lake downloads to temporary files, verifies their hashes, atomically installs only valid
# artifacts, and returns failure when any transfer fails. A retry over the same cache therefore
# preserves verified artifacts and fetches only those still missing. If every attempt fails, we
# discard the partial cache before the build so its final behavior remains exactly the same as
# when the cache is switched off. See https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/14651 and
# https://github.com/EpsilonEridaniProject/EpsilonEridani/issues/2062.
