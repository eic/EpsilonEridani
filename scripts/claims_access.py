"""Keep the shared claim namespace open to everyone who has landed a PR here, and sweep dead leases.

Workers run by different people must not spend two subscriptions on the same job, so before starting
one they take a lease: a `refs/epsiloneridani-claims/<key>` ref, acquired by compare-and-swap, in a repository
every worker can push to. That repository is eic/epsiloneridani-claims, and it holds nothing else:
no code, no Actions, no relationship to this one. Coordinating workers must never need write access to
the library itself, which is the whole reason the leases do not live here.

So somebody has to be let in, and this decides who: the author of any merged pull request in this
repository. A maintainer looked at their work and took it, which is a better statement than org
membership and is already recorded on GitHub, so there is no list to keep. A worker whose operator has
not landed anything yet is not stuck waiting — it claims in its own fork until then, and so still
coordinates with the rest of its own fleet.

  grant  Invite every merged-PR author who is not already a collaborator or already invited. Grants
         are monotone: nothing is revoked automatically, because a quiet operator silently losing
         coordination is a confusing thing to debug from the worker side. Remove abuse by hand.
  sweep  Delete leases that expired more than SWEEP_GRACE_MINUTES ago. Releasing a lease deletes it,
         so these are the leavings of workers that died holding one; the grace period keeps the sweep
         clear of a live takeover, which is itself a compare-and-swap.

Reconciling (rather than reacting to a merge event) is what makes this self-healing: a missed webhook,
a failed API call, or an invitation that expired unaccepted after seven days is simply picked up on the
next run.

Env: GH_TOKEN (reads merged PRs here), CLAIMS_TOKEN (administers the claims repo: `Administration:
write` to invite, `Contents: write` to sweep), REPO (owner/name), optional CLAIMS_REPO, DRY_RUN=1,
SWEEP_GRACE_MINUTES.
