"""Generate a stacked "lines of Lean per roadmap, over time" SVG.

Unlike scripts/loc_graph.py, which counts the lines present in the tree straight
from git, this chart needs to know *which roadmap* each line belongs to — and that
attribution lives in the PR labels (`roadmap/<Area>`), not in git. So the series is
built from merged new-mathematics pull requests: each PR contributes its net diff
(additions minus deletions) to its roadmap's running total on the day it merged,
and the bands are the cumulative totals over time.

That makes this a churn-based measure (a line rewritten by a later PR is counted in
both), not a `wc -l` of the tree; it answers "how much labelled work has landed per
roadmap", which is the question the labels make answerable. Infrastructure and
unresolved `roadmap/Unknown` PRs are excluded, as are maintenance PRs recognized
from their conventional-commit title. The latter is deliberately independent of
`roadmap/none`, so adding roadmap attribution to a refactor does not change the
chart's meaning.

Data comes from `gh` by default (needs auth: GH_TOKEN with pull-requests:read), or
from a `--data` JSON file (the output of
`gh pr list --state merged --json number,title,labels,mergedAt,additions,deletions`) for
offline rendering and tests. Pure stdlib otherwise, matching loc_graph.py so CI needs
no pip install. Styled for the navy Epsilon Eridani site (see web/static_files/style.css).
