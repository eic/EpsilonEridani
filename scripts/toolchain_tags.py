"""Audit and create Tau Ceti's Lean toolchain tags (`v4.33.0-rc2`, `v4.34.0`, ...).

Mathlib tags every Lean release, so a project on Lean v4.34.0 can check out mathlib at
`v4.34.0` and get a tree that builds. These tags do the same for Tau Ceti.

## What the tool does

`vX` is the first commit on `main` whose `lean-toolchain` is `leanprover/lean4:X`.
`--create` tags that commit once its post-merge CI has passed and its oleans are in the
Lake cache. The tool reads both from what is already recorded, without rebuilding.

Mathlib puts its `vX` tag on the commit that bumps its own `lean-toolchain` to X, and
`scripts/check-bump.sh` requires Tau Ceti's toolchain to match mathlib's at whatever it
pins. The first `main` commit on toolchain X therefore pins mathlib at or after mathlib's
`vX` tag. The pin is usually a little past it; the tag message gives it.

## What it leaves to a human

The tool tags only commits on `main`, and reports a release `main` never ran on as
`unreachable`. Two things cause that: the daily bump stepped over the release's window on
mathlib master, which for a stable release has been fifteen hours, or mathlib cut the
release on its `stable` branch, which `check-bump.sh` will not let this repository pin.

Tagging one anyway takes four steps. `v4.33.0` was done this way:

  1. Branch `releases/vX` from the last `main` commit before the bump jumped. Change
     `lean-toolchain` and `lake-manifest.json` to pin mathlib at its `vX` tag, and nothing
     else, so no source differs from that `main` commit.
  2. Build from source and run the audits and lints that commit defines. The pin moves
     forward by at least a bump's worth, so this is where it can fail.
  3. To publish the oleans, which does not happen automatically off `main`:
     `lake build --no-build -o .lake/outputs.jsonl`, `lake cache stage`, then
     `lake cache put-staged --rev <sha> --toolchain leanprover/lean4:vX`. Run that from a
     Lake at v4.34.0-rc1 or later; earlier ones lack both flags. Then fetch the published
     mapping and diff it against the staged one.
  4. Create the annotated tag, recording that the commit was constructed.

The report then shows the release as `tagged`, notes the commit was constructed, and says
whether it found a cache. `--create` does not do any of this; step 2 is a build.

Releases older than `EARLIEST_RELEASE` are out of scope, because the Lake cache does not
reach back that far.

If a tag does not match the rule, the tool reports it and changes nothing.

## Usage

    toolchain_tags.py                        # the report
    toolchain_tags.py --json                 # the same, machine-readable
    toolchain_tags.py --create v4.33.0-rc2   # create one tag
    toolchain_tags.py --create --all         # create every tag that is ready
    toolchain_tags.py --create --all --dry-run

POLICY = """\
Tau Ceti toolchain tags
=======================

`vX` is the first commit on `main` whose lean-toolchain is `leanprover/lean4:X`.

Mathlib puts its `vX` tag on the commit that bumps its own toolchain to X, and
check-bump.sh requires this repository's toolchain to match mathlib's at whatever it pins,
so such a commit pins mathlib at or after mathlib's `vX` tag. The tag message gives the pin.

A tag is created once that commit's post-merge CI has passed and its oleans are in the Lake
artifact cache, so a checkout builds without recompiling the library. The tool reads both
from what is already recorded, without rebuilding.

The tool tags only commits on main, and reports a release main never ran on as
`unreachable`: either the daily bump stepped over its window on mathlib master, or mathlib
cut it on its `stable` branch, which check-bump.sh will not let this repository pin. Tagging
one anyway takes four manual steps, including a build. v4.33.0 was done that way; the steps
are in this script's module docstring.

Releases older than %s are out of scope, because the Lake cache has no
older entries.

If a tag does not match the rule, the tool reports it and changes nothing.
