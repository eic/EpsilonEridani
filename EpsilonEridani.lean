-- This is the AI-owned root of the EpsilonEridani mathematics library.
--
-- It is intentionally empty. The lakefile's `globs = ["EpsilonEridani.*"]` is authoritative
-- for what gets built and axiom-audited: `lake build` builds every `EpsilonEridani/` module
-- directly, and the audit (`scripts/Axioms.lean`) enumerates the source tree, so nothing
-- depends on this root re-exporting the library. No code does `import EpsilonEridani`.
--
-- A PR therefore never needs to touch this file. It is kept (rather than deleted) only
-- because it is the library's root module; the import-boundary guard still applies, so it
-- must not import `EpsilonEridaniRoadmap` or `EpsilonEridaniReview`.
